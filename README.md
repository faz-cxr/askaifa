# Aifa Question-Answering

ðŸ¤–Ask questions to your Aifa in natural languageðŸ¤–

ðŸ’ª Built with [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain)

# ðŸŒ² Environment Setup

In order to set your environment up to run the code here, first install all requirements:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then set your OpenAI API key (if you don't have one, get one [here](https://beta.openai.com/playground))

```shell
export OPENAI_API_KEY=....
```

# ðŸ“„ What is in here?
- Aifa's database
- Code to deploy on StreamLit
- Instructions for ingesting your own dataset

## ðŸ“Š Example Data
This repo uses the [Blendle Employee Handbook](https://www.notion.so/Blendle-s-Employee-Handbook-7692ffe24f07450785f093b94bbe1a09) as an example.
It was downloaded October 18th so may have changed slightly since then!

## ðŸ’¬ Ask a question
In order to ask a question, run a command like:

```shell
python qa.py "What is the work from home policy"
```

You can switch out `What is the work from home policy` for any question of your liking!

This exposes a chat interface for interacting with aifa.
IMO, this is a more natural and convenient interface for getting information.

## ðŸš€ Code to deploy on StreamLit

The code to run the StreamLit app is in `main.py`. 
Note that when setting up your StreamLit app you should make sure to add `OPENAI_API_KEY` as a secret environment variable.
