The Zika virus infection is a disease that is mainly spread by bites from some types
of mosquito.

These mosquitoes generally live in warm, moist climates. If you live in or travel
to these places you should take steps to avoid being bitten.

What is it?
The Zika virus is found in areas where certain types of mosquito are common. For example,
Zika has been found in South and Central America, the Caribbean, and Mexico. It has
also been found in parts of Miami, Florida, in the US, and some parts of West Africa,
the Western Pacific, and Southeast Asia.

In the outbreak of 2019, cases of Zika in returning travellers were reported in the
UK, Europe, the US, Australia, New Zealand, Israel, and China, among other countries.

The Zika virus usually causes mild symptoms or no symptoms at all. But it has been
linked with two serious conditions: microcephaly at birth and Guillain-Barré syndrome.

Microcephaly at birth is when a baby is born with a small head. This can affect the growth and development
of the baby’s brain. Microcephaly is rare, but women infected with Zika during pregnancy
have a greater chance than other pregnant women of having a baby with this condition.

Zika has also been linked to other problems in newborns, including:


seizures


eye problems


hearing loss, and


other birth defects affecting the face and head.


Guillain-Barré syndrome is a rare condition that affects the body’s nervous system. It can cause problems
with movement, breathing, speech, and swallowing.

People infected with Zika seem to have a raised risk of getting this illness. Zika
may also be linked to other rare problems affecting the nervous system, such as myelitis
(inflammation of the spinal cord).

How does Zika spread?
Mosquito bites
People can catch Zika from the bites of some types of mosquito - in the same way you
can catch diseases such as malaria, chikungunya, and dengue fever from mosquito bites
in some countries.

One big difference between malaria and Zika is that the mosquitoes that spread Zika
bite mainly during the day (though also sometimes at night), while the mosquitoes
that spread malaria bite at night.

This means that, if you’re in an area where Zika is found, you need to take measures
to avoid mosquito bites 24 hours a day.

Another problem is that the mosquitoes that spread Zika breed in small pools of water
near homes. This makes them hard to get rid of.

Other ways Zika might spread
Nearly everyone infected with Zika gets it from mosquito bites. But a small number
of people have also caught it from having sex with an infected person. It's likely
that the virus can be spread through vaginal, anal, and oral sex.

Zika can also spread from a pregnant woman to her unborn baby.
You may have heard that Zika can be spread by other types of contact, such as kissing
and breastfeeding. But, while the Zika virus has been found in other body fluids,
including saliva and breast milk, there is not yet any clear evidence that it can
be spread through other specific types of contact.

However, there has been one case in the US of the virus spreading to a carer from
a person very ill with Zika.

What are the symptoms?
Most people infected with Zika have no symptoms at all. It’s thought that only about
20 in every 100 people who get infected will become ill.

If you get symptoms of Zika after a mosquito bite, the symptoms usually develop between
3 and 14 days after you are bitten. But it can be shorter or longer than this.

Zika symptoms tend to be mild and to go away after 2 to 7 days. Possible symptoms
include:



a slight fever


pain in the joints, and sometimes swelling in the fingers and toes


a rash, which may or may not be itchy


red eyes or conjunctivitis (a mild eye infection)


headache


pain in some muscles, and


pain in the eyes.


The symptoms of Zika are similar to (but milder than) some of the symptoms of dengue
fever, which is found in some of the same countries where Zika is found.

It is rare for anyone to have severe symptoms and to become very ill. It is very rare
for anyone to die from the Zika virus.

If you have any or even all of the symptoms listed above, it is highly unlikely that
you have Zika unless:



you live in an area where there is Zika, or


you have recently travelled to an area where there is Zika, and the symptoms appeared
within two weeks of your return, or



you have had sexual contact with someone who is infected with Zika or might be infected
(for example, if they have recently travelled to an area with Zika).



What treatments are available?
There is no vaccine to prevent Zika infection yet. And there is no drug that can treat
Zika specifically. Treatment is aimed at easing the symptoms, such as fever and pain.


For now, then, the best way to treat Zika is to prevent it. This means taking steps
to avoid mosquito bites if you are in an area affected by Zika. These steps include:




using mosquito repellents. You will need to use an approved repellent, according to the directions in your
local health guidelines. If you are using sunscreen, apply mosquito repellent over
the sunscreen. Some repellents should not be used on very young babies. Be sure to
check the label before using a repellent on an infant



covering up as much exposed skin as possible so that it’s harder for mosquitoes to find a place
to bite. This might mean wearing clothes that cover more of your body than you might
normally wear in a hot country, such as long trousers, and shirts with long sleeves



treating clothing and gear with an insect repellant called permethrin or purchasing
permethrin-treated items. You should not, however, put permethrin directly on your
skin



taking steps to avoid bites 24 hours a day


staying in air-conditioned rooms when possible, or in rooms with insect screens over
windows and doors



sleeping under a mosquito net, and also covering cots, prams, and baby carriers with
a mosquito net.



Zika, travel, and pregnancy
Because of the risk of microcephaly in babies born to women infected with Zika during
pregnancy, much of the advice around Zika, and in particular travel advice, is aimed
at women.

The main points are:


If you are a pregnant woman, or if you are planning to become pregnant, you should
avoid travelling to an area with an active Zika outbreak.



If you can’t avoid travelling to an area where there is an active Zika outbreak, or
if you live in an area with Zika, then carefully follow the steps listed above for
avoiding mosquito bites.



If you are pregnant and have recently returned from an area where there is Zika, you
should see your doctor. Your doctor should arrange for you to have tests to check
whether you have been infected.

At the moment, women are advised to avoid becoming pregnant while travelling in an
area where there is an active Zika outbreak.

You should also avoid becoming pregnant for a while after returning from your journey.
This is to allow enough time to be as sure as possible that you haven’t been infected.


The advice on how long you should wait before becoming pregnant varies. For example,
women returning to the UK from areas with an active Zika outbreak are advised not
to become pregnant for 8 weeks.

However, women living in areas with Zika may be advised to avoid becoming pregnant
for a much longer period.

Sexual contact
Although Zika is usually spread through mosquito bites, the virus can also be passed
from person to person through sexual contact.

Advice about sexual contact differs among countries. For example, in the UK, men who
have lived in or travelled to an area with Zika and have a pregnant partner are advised
to either:



not have sex with their partner for the whole of the pregnancy, or to


use condoms every time for vaginal, anal, and oral sex for the whole of the pregnancy.


Also, if a couple is travelling to an area with Zika and there is a chance the woman
might become pregnant, they are advised to use effective contraception to prevent
pregnancy, as well as condoms when having vaginal, anal, or oral sex. They are also
advised to continue with these measures:



for 8 weeks after returning from an area with Zika if the man has no symptoms similar
to those of Zika



for 6 months after the man has recovered from an illness with symptoms similar to
those of Zika, and



for 6 months after the man has recovered from an illness that was confirmed as being
Zika.



It is possible that this advice will change as we learn more about Zika and about
how it is, and is not, spread.

What to expect in the future?
Most people infected with Zika don’t have any symptoms. Those people who do have symptoms
usually have a mild illness that lasts only a few days - a bit like a mild flu.

It is rare for anyone to have serious complications from Zika or to die from it. However,
be sure to see your doctor if you have weakness in your arms or legs, or difficulty
breathing. These could be symptoms of Guillain-Barré syndrome.

The main concern about Zika at the moment is that pregnant women who are infected
with Zika might have babies with microcephaly or other problems.

If you are pregnant or are planning to become pregnant and are worried about Zika,
talk to your doctor. Your doctor may recommend that you have additional monitoring
and tests, such as ultrasounds, if you are already pregnant."

Many children have problems settling at bedtime or wake up often during the night.
But there are some simple things you can do to help your child sleep better.

We've looked at the research about sleep problems to see what methods work. You can
use our information to talk to your doctor and decide which methods are best for your
child.

This information is for children over the age of 2 years.
This information covers common problems that children have falling asleep or staying
asleep. It does not cover specific conditions such as obstructive sleep apnoea, parasomnias
(these include things like sleepwalking, night terrors, and teeth grinding), and sleep
problems in children with conditions such as autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) or attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

How do I know if my child has a sleep problem?
All of this information is for children over the age of 2.
Not all children who occasionally wake at night or who make some fuss about going
to bed need any special attention. But doctors say a child may have a sleep problem
if they have one or more of the following symptoms:



It takes your child a long time to fall asleep and you have to make special preparations
to try to get him or her to sleep.



Bedtimes are difficult and stressful for you and your child. Your child may have regular
tantrums at bedtime.



Your child doesn't have an illness or other condition that makes it hard for them
to get to sleep or stay asleep, and is not on any medication that makes them less
sleepy.



Your child has a lot of trouble getting back to sleep if they wake up, and can't get
back to sleep unless you help them.



What methods work?
Positive bedtime routine
You might like to try a positive bedtime routine. This can help your child settle
more quickly and make them wake less during the night.

Some research has found that children have fewer tantrums and settle more quickly
at bedtime within six weeks of starting a positive bedtime routine. Doctors sometimes
call it 'good sleep hygiene.' A positive routine includes:



having a short, regular, calming routine leading up to bed


making your child's bedroom quiet, dark, comfortable, and not too hot or cold


avoiding boisterous play before bedtime


not giving your child caffeine, for example in cola drinks and chocolate.


Sleep training
Sleep training is another option. It may help your child settle at night, learn to
settle themselves, and reduce waking during the night.

Sleep training involves gradually waiting before responding to your child. For example,
you might wait two minutes before going to your child. The next time your child wakes
up, you might wait four minutes.You might then extend the time gradually to a maximum
of 20 minutes.

Or you can gradually increase the distance between yourself and your child when settling
them for sleep. You might start off sitting next to your child's bed. Then on the
next night you move 30 centimetres (one foot) away, and so on until you are outside
the bedroom.

Remember, this information on sleep training is for children over the age of 2 years. Ignoring a crying baby or any child with a health problem is not recommended. And
some experts think that sleep training might cause distress for the child, so it's
always a good idea to discuss any plans for sleep training with your doctor.

Medicines
Medications are not generally used for most children who have trouble falling asleep
or staying asleep. Behavioural methods, such as the ones described above, are used
instead. In rare instances, for example in children with ADHD or autism, a medication
called melatonin might be used. Antihistamines and sleeping pills should not be given
to children for sleep problems.

Other things you can try
Doctors often advise some other things for children who have problems sleeping, although
there hasn't been much research on these methods:



Try not to let your child nap too late in the day or for too long.


Making sure your child is fairly active during the day may mean that they sleep better
at night.



Daylight helps the body to make natural melatonin, which keeps our 'body clock' regular.
So being outside for some time during the day might help.



What will happen?
If your child has problems staying asleep at night they may find it hard to concentrate
during the day. This can make them moody and can lead to issues with behaviour. Bear
in mind that most young children's sleep patterns improve with behavioural methods.

If you are having trouble coping, talk to your doctor. There may be local groups or
services that can help. You may also be able to find an online support group."

Almost everyone gets wrinkles as they get older. There's no cure for wrinkles but
if they bother you there are treatments that can make your skin look and feel smoother.

We've looked at the best and most up-to-date research to produce this information.
You can use it to help decide which treatments are right for you.

What are wrinkles?
Wrinkles are lines or creases on the surface of your skin. They are a natural part
of ageing. But other things can affect the way your skin looks, too.



The most common cause of wrinkles is simply getting older. As you get older your skin
gets thinner, more fragile, and less elastic (stretchy), so it tends to wrinkle and
crease.



Too much exposure to the sun's rays can also damage collagen and elastin - the parts
of your skin that keep it smooth, firm, and elastic.



Smoking also causes wrinkles. The toxins in cigarette smoke stop your skin from producing
as much new collagen. Collagen is a protein that makes up a large part of your skin.



What are the symptoms?
Having wrinkles is not an illness. But wrinkles can alter the way you look and this
may change the way you feel about yourself.

Wrinkles are often especially noticeable on your face, particularly across your forehead,
between your eyebrows, and around your mouth. You may also get lines around the front
of your neck and on your hands.

What treatments work?
There are many treatments for wrinkles, ranging from creams to injections and facelifts.
Many people use more than one treatment.

You should always read the labels on any treatments carefully to check for possible
side effects. You can also ask your doctor about side effects, especially if you are
thinking about some of the more complicated treatments.

The treatments that might suit you will depend on how visible your wrinkles are and
how much they bother you, as well as on things such as:



your age


your skin's type and texture


your skin's thickness


how damaged your skin has been by the sun


what you want from your treatment


your lifestyle.


Treatments are likely to work better and for longer if you:


don't smoke


avoid exposing the treated areas to too much sun


use high sun protection factor (SPF) sunscreen on treated areas when in direct sun.


Treatments for fine wrinkles
For fine wrinkles, or for wrinkles that are only visible with certain facial expressions
(for example, 'laugh lines' when you smile), the most common treatments are retinoid
creams. But there are other treatments, such as superficial (mild) chemical peels.

Retinoids
Research suggests that creams containing retinoids work better than other creams for
preventing and treating fine wrinkles. Retinoids work by encouraging the replacement
of the very top layer of skin, and by helping to repair damage to skin and small blood
vessels.

Retinoids may cause side effects in some people, including skin irritation and lightening
or, sometimes, darkening of the skin. These colour changes are temporary.

Antioxidants
Antioxidants include green tea and vitamins, and come as creams and sometimes as tablets.
They are intended to help prevent damage caused by sun, stress, and air pollution.

Superficial chemical peels
Superficial chemical peels are creams containing acid. They work by destroying the
very top layer of the skin, revealing the younger, less-damaged skin beneath. This
treatment is similar to treatments used to rub away (exfoliate) old skin cells.

This treatment can cause side effects in some people, including dry skin or skin irritation.
Botulinum toxin injections (Botox)
This treatment works by affecting the nerves in the skin. This stops some of the muscles
under the skin from moving normally. This means that the treated areas of skin don't
wrinkle as much as usual when your face moves: for example, when you smile, frown,
or laugh. One treatment of Botox lasts about six months. If you have had a chemical
peel, you must allow the skin to recover completely before you use Botox.

Botox can cause side effects, including pain at the site of the injection, bruising,
headache, muscle weakness, and short-term loss of some feeling at the site of the
injection.

Treatments for deeper wrinkles
There are several treatments that can help with deeper wrinkles.
Medium-to-deep thickness chemical peels
These are stronger versions of the chemical peels used for fine wrinkles. They remove
more skin than the superficial chemical peels. They can cause side effects, including
cold sores, changes in skin colour (which are usually temporary), and scarring.

Fillers
Fillers are substances that can be injected under the skin to fill wrinkles and make
the skin look smoother. There are many different kinds and they vary in how long their
effects last.

Examples of fillers include collagen, hyaluronic acid, or your own fat. Each has different
advantages and disadvantages. For example, some substances may carry a risk of allergic
reaction. Using fat means your own fat has to be extracted first.

Treatments for very deep wrinkles
If you have very deep wrinkles there are treatments that can help improve the texture
and appearance of the skin. But you should think carefully before having any of these
treatments.

You will need a local anaesthetic for many of these treatments. It also takes several
days or even weeks to recover from some of them.

Dermabrasion
This treatment involves a therapist scraping or sanding away several layers of skin
using a hand-held tool called a dermabrader, allowing fresh skin to take its place.
It takes between 7 and 10 days for the skin to heal. If you have the treatment, you
will be given a local anaesthetic and another painkiller called a nerve block.

Dermabrasion can have side effects, including scarring and skin infections.
Microdermabrasion
This treatment is similar to dermabrasion but involves tiny crystals or other abrasive
substances being blown onto the face to remove old and damaged skin.

Fractional photothermolysis
This is a type of laser therapy that only targets damaged skin. It's quite a new treatment,
which possibly has fewer side effects than other similar treatments.

Laser ablation
This treatment uses laser therapy to remove several layers of skin.
As with other treatments that remove layers of skin, your skin will need time to recover
after laser ablation.

Autologous fat grafting
With this treatment, a therapist removes fat from other parts of your body - usually
your thighs, belly, or buttocks - and injects it under areas of wrinkled skin in your
face to make it look smoother and less wrinkled. This treatment is often favoured
by older people who lose weight as they age. This weight loss can cause skin on the
face to look sunken or wrinkled in places. The difference between this and using fillers
is that this technique only uses your own body fat, not any other substances.

Rhytidectomy (facelift)
This is another treatment that may be suitable for older people, as skin tends to
sag as we age. This operation tightens and lifts the skin of the face that has sagged.
But it is not a treatment for wrinkles or for the texture of the skin.

The results of facelifts can last longer than many other treatments. But a facelift
is surgery and, like all operations, it carries risks, including infections. Side
effects of facelifts can include scarring, bruising, hair loss, and nerve damage.

Is there anything I can do to prevent wrinkles?
There's no scientifically proven way to prevent wrinkles. But there are a few things
you can try.



High-factor sunscreens help to protect your skin from the sun, so it's possible that they might help prevent
wrinkles.



Avoiding too much sun. It's important for your health to get some sun. But too much sun can play a part
in causing skin cancer, not just wrinkles. So it makes good sense to be sensible in
the sun and avoid getting sunburn. That means using sunscreens, covering up, wearing
a hat, and staying out of strong sunshine. Some treatments for wrinkles need to be
used alongside sun avoidance.



Stopping smoking. Smoking speeds up skin ageing. So stopping smoking is important."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1554094933496/Whiplash,Whiplash,"Whiplash Last published: Jan 07, 2021
Whiplash is a neck injury that causes pain and stiffness. It usually gets better on
its own after a few days or weeks. But there are things you can do to help with the
pain and speed up your recovery.

We’ve looked at the best and most up-to-date research to produce this information.
You can use it to talk to your doctor and decide which treatments are right for you.

What is whiplash?
Whiplash is a type of neck injury that can happen if your head is suddenly jolted
backwards and forwards in a whip-like movement. The most common cause of whiplash
is a vehicle crash. When this happens your neck muscles and ligaments (the strands
of tissue that hold your bones together) stretch more than normal and may be sprained.

You can also get whiplash from a sport injury or if you jolt your neck if you trip
or fall.

What are the symptoms?
If you have whiplash your neck will be sore, especially when you try to move it. The
pain will probably feel worse the day after the injury. You may have some other symptoms
within the first two days after your injury, or they might start a day or two afterwards.
These could include:



A stiff neck


Headaches


Pain in your shoulder or between your shoulder blades


Pain in your lower back


Trouble concentrating


Dizziness, ringing in your ears, or blurred vision. This should go away quickly. Tell
your doctor if it doesn't.



Tell your doctor if these symptoms don't start to get better after about a week, or
if they get worse.

A severe whiplash injury can cause more serious problems that need hospital treatment.
The spine or spinal cord (the nerves that run through the spine) can get damaged.
You should go back to see your doctor if:



The pain from your injury gets worse after a day or two, or


You get any numbness, weakness, or pins and needles in your arm or hand at any time.


What treatments work?
Your pain and stiffness should start to get better within a few days. There are some
things you can do to help your recovery.

Things you can do for yourself
You might feel as though you should rest and move as little as possible after whiplash.


Your doctor might refer you to a physiotherapist. The physiotherapist can give you
advice about how to move your neck and what exercises can help with your neck pain.


Although doing these exercises can be a big help, don't push yourself too much. Don't
do the exercises so much that they hurt.

Neck collars can help with more serious neck injuries. But they don't help with whiplash
and can actually make things worse. This is because they stop you moving your neck
normally.

Medicines
Painkillers can help with neck pain, especially in the first few days after your injury
when the pain is likely to be at its worst.

You can buy some painkillers, such as paracetamol and ibuprofen, without a prescription.
But be careful not to take more than the recommended dose.

Ibuprofen is what's called a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). These drugs
reduce pain and also help reduce inflammation (swelling).

Taking NSAIDs can cause side effects such as heart problems and bleeding in the stomach.
But this usually only happens if you take them at a high dose over a long period.
So this shouldn't be a problem if you're only taking them for a few days for whiplash.

People who have heart problems shouldn't take an NSAID called diclofenac.
If your pain is severe your doctor might suggest a short course of stronger painkillers
called opioids. But most people don't need them. Opioids are usually only recommended
for short periods, as people can become dependent on them.

What will happen to me?
The pain and stiffness from whiplash usually go away in a few days or weeks. But the
symptoms can sometimes last a lot longer. For example, some people still have some
pain and stiffness many years after the accident that caused their whiplash.

Your doctor should follow up with you soon after your injury. If your pain persists
you might need further tests to see why it hasn't stopped."

If you’ve had a heart attack, there are things that you and your doctors can do to
reduce your chances of having another.

Talk to your doctors
Before you leave hospital, make sure you understand what has happened to you. Talk
about your heart attack, test results, and treatments with your doctors. Ask whether
you need to change your diet or do more exercise.

Your doctors should answer all of your questions. You may also be given some written
information that tells you what you can do to reduce your chances of having another
heart attack.

Take your drug treatments
You'll probably get several drug treatments to take after a heart attack to reduce
your chances of having another one.

These may include medications to:


stop your blood from clotting in your blood vessels


dilate (widen) your blood vessels so that blood can pass through them more easily


lower your blood pressure


lower your cholesterol.


It’s important that you take these medicines as directed. You might need to take them
for the rest of your life.

Stop smoking
If you smoke, try to stop. Smoking narrows the arteries that carry blood to your heart
(your coronary arteries). If you’d like to stop, the doctors at your hospital, your
regular doctor, or your cardiac rehabilitation team will be able to assist you.

There are many treatments that can help you stop smoking. Talk to your doctor about
what options would be best for you.

Having counselling with other people who are trying to stop smoking can also help.
Also, tell your friends and family that you are going to stop smoking. Their support
will be important.

And be realistic. You might not stop on your first try. But it's important to keep
trying until you're successful.

Eat a healthy diet
If you've had a heart attack, you'll be advised to eat a healthy diet. You should
aim to:



eat more fruit, vegetables, and nuts


eat wholemeal bread and pasta instead of white bread and pasta


eat less sugar, red meat, and processed foods


cook with olive oil rather than other types of fat.


Your doctor might also suggest that you eat between two and four portions of oily
fish a week. Oily fish include salmon, trout, mackerel, tuna (fresh, not tinned) and
sardines.

If you're taking vitamin supplements, make sure they don't contain beta-carotene.
It can increase your chance of another heart attack.

Join a cardiac rehabilitation programme
Rehabilitation programmes can help you recover from your heart attack, and keep your
heart healthy. Before you leave hospital, you and your doctors should discuss how
you can join a programme. If your doctors don't mention it, ask.

Cardiac rehabilitation is an important part of your recovery. It can help you:


recover faster


get fit


change your lifestyle to reduce your risk of having another heart attack


manage stress or depression


live longer.


Most cardiac rehabilitation programmes include:


information about exercising


education about making healthy lifestyle choices, including eating better and giving
up smoking



counselling, or a talking treatment, to help you manage stress and depression.


Everyone is different, so the rehabilitation team at your hospital will plan a programme
that suits you. It may last six weeks, six months, or even longer. But it can't work
without your commitment. Don't give up.

Take regular exercise
With help from your cardiac rehabilitation team or your doctor, you can develop an
exercise plan that suits your needs, abilities, and interests. Or you may do supervised
exercise as part of a rehabilitation programme.

Exercise improves stamina and strength, and can make you feel good. Over time, exercise
makes your heart work better. It can also help you lose weight.

For most people, a supervised exercise programme after a heart attack is safe. And
many people can continue to exercise safely on their own after a few weeks.

Consider counselling
You may feel anxious or depressed after a heart attack. Lots of people do. But anxiety
and depression can slow down your recovery. A good cardiac rehabilitation programme
will spot these problems and offer you treatment. If you need help, make sure you
ask for it. It is an important part of your recovery."

Most doctors recommend children do at least an hour a day of physical activity, which
can be broken into smaller chunks of 10 minutes at a time.

There are lots of ways that parents can help their children become more physically
active. Physical activity doesn’t have to be sport, although sport is great for children
who enjoy it. It could also mean:



taking a brisk walk


cycling or walking to school


taking dance classes


just playing games outside.


It’s best to try to find something your child enjoys doing, so they learn to see physical
activity as a good thing.

One way to help increase the amount of physical activity a child can do is to reduce
the amount of time they spend on inactive pursuits, such as watching television or
playing video games. Studies show that children who watch more television are more
likely to be overweight.

Doctors recommend that children spend no more than two hours a day watching television
or playing with video games or computers. This is sometimes called ‘screen time’ because
it’s the amount of time they spend sitting down looking at a screen. To help your
child limit their screen time, you might consider also restricting the amount of time
the whole family watches television and uses electronic devices."

Many different diets have been used to help children reach a healthy weight. The research
doesn’t tell us for sure which type of diet is best. But here are some of the things
doctors often recommend.



Cut down on unhealthy food options, such as fast foods, and concentrate on eating
more fruit and vegetables. This means your child will be getting more nutrients and
fibre, which are important in a healthy diet. Snacking on an apple or a carrot may
make your child less likely to eat unhealthy snacks like biscuits or crisps.



Avoid sugar-sweetened soft drinks, like cola or lemonade. These drinks have a lot
of calories and few nutrients.



Try the ‘traffic light’ diet. This involves learning whether foods fall into ‘red’,
‘yellow’, or ‘green’ categories. Green foods, such as fruit and vegetables, can be
eaten freely. Yellow foods, such as cereals and dairy products, can be eaten in moderation.
Red foods, such as sweets, biscuits, and crisps, should be avoided or eaten only occasionally.
Ask your doctor for more information about this approach.



Eat breakfast. Eating a healthy breakfast means children don’t feel as hungry later.
This can help them resist eating unhealthy snacks during the day.



Don’t use food as a reward (for example, offering a doughnut for finishing homework).


Have family meals, where everyone eats the same food. Even if only one member of the
family is overweight, it’s easier for them to eat a healthy diet if everyone, adults
and children, sticks to the same rules."

Reaching and maintaining a healthy weight can be very difficult for some children.
They need a lot of help and encouragement. They may also have lost confidence in themselves
because of worrying about their weight, or being teased about it.

Some children benefit from seeing a counsellor about their weight. A counsellor might
help the child to:



Understand more about food and a healthy diet


Set goals to eat more healthily


Decide how to increase the amount of exercise they do


Solve problems (for example, work out how to deal with situations when they are tempted
to go back to unhealthy habits)



Increase their confidence, so they feel better about themselves and their bodies.




Families can also help a lot with this. If all the family agrees to the same rules
(for example, not eating snacks in front of the television, or always going for a
family bike ride at the weekend) then it’s easier for the child to stick to them.


It’s important that the child’s parents understand what the child needs to do, and
help the child to do it. This might involve helping the child avoid temptation, by
not having unhealthy snack foods or sugary drinks in the house, or by unplugging the
television so it’s harder to switch on. It might also involve having plenty of healthy
food available, and suggesting alternative activities to watching the television,
such as doing crafts or playing games."

It can be upsetting to hear that your child has a weight problem. But it’s a problem
that's facing many children. To give your child the best chance of a healthy, happy
life, you’ll want to help them to reach and maintain a healthy weight.

When is a child overweight?
Most doctors use the body mass index (BMI for short) to find out whether people are at a healthy weight. Your BMI is a
number that's worked out from your height and weight.

To tell if children are overweight, doctors compare their BMI to that of other children
who are the same age and sex. They do this using child growth charts.

When doctors talk about children being overweight, they mean their BMI is higher than
that of most children who are the same age and sex.

You might be shocked to be told that your child is overweight, and you might feel
angry or guilty. But parents often don’t realise that their child is overweight.

There are lots of reasons for this. Children grow at different rates, and a parent
may think a child has just put on a bit of ‘puppy fat’. Also, if the child’s school
friends or relatives are also overweight, parents may think their child’s weight is
normal compared with the weight of those around them.

The reasons why children become overweight are usually the same as the reasons why
adults become overweight: they are regularly eating more calories than their body
is using up as energy. Calories that are not used as energy are stored as fat.

There are a few main factors that determine whether a child eats more calories than
they use:



The type of food the child eats (his or her diet)


How much the child eats


How much exercise the child takes.


Some parents think their child must be overweight because of their genes. It’s true
that a child’s genes can make them more likely to put on weight. But it’s still important
to help your child to eat healthily, take exercise, and aim to achieve a healthy weight.


Rarely, other issues may cause a child to gain weight. These include hormonal issues,
medicines, and genetic conditions (for example, Prader-Willi syndrome). Your doctor
will check to make sure nothing unusual is causing your child's weight gain.

What treatments work?
If your child weighs more than is healthy, your doctor may suggest they try to keep
their weight steady for six months or longer. That way, they may ‘grow into’ a healthy
weight, rather than needing to lose weight.

But if your child is very overweight, your doctor will probably recommend they try
to lose weight. Either way, the best approach usually involves a combination of changing
what they eat (their diet), exercising, and adopting healthier habits.

Diet, exercise, and changing habits
For most overweight children, the best approach to achieving a healthy weight involves
eating better, exercising more, and changing unhealthy behaviours.

Children have the best chance of success if their family is actively involved. If
all the family agrees to the same rules (for example, not eating snacks in front of
the television, or always going for a long walk at the weekends) then it’s easier
for the child to stick to them.



Improving a child’s diet. This often involves eating more fruit and vegetables, cutting out sugary drinks,
avoiding fast food, and not having high-calorie snacks like biscuits or crisps between
meals. (For more information, see our leaflet Weight problems in children: improving a child's diet.)



Increasing physical activity. Doctors usually recommend children get at least 60 minutes of physical activity
a day. There are many different ways to increase activity, such as taking part in
sports, going on regular family walks, and walking or cycling to school.

Most doctors also recommend limiting a child's screen time (including television,
computer and video games, and internet) to less than two hours a day. (For more information,
see our leaflet Weight problems in children: increasing physical activity.)



Changing unhealthy habits. This can include setting goals for healthy eating and activity, tackling hard-to-change
habits, and helping your child have more self-confidence and feel better about themselves.

Many children benefit from seeing a counsellor who specialises in helping children
manage their weight. (For more information, see our leaflet Weight problems in children: changing unhealthy habits.)



All three of these steps are important for helping a child achieve a healthy weight.
Your doctor might help you draw up a plan for things you can do at home, or suggest
your child sees a counsellor to help you make a plan. Or your child might be referred
to hospital to join a specialist programme for overweight children.

Once a child has reached a healthy weight, it’s important that they get lots of help
and support to not slip back into unhealthy habits.

Medicines and surgery
Medicines to reduce weight are not often used in children. They are usually only used if a
child is older (at least 12) and their weight is putting their health at serious risk.


One medicine that is sometimes used is called orlistat. Another option is a medicine called metformin, which is usually used to treat people with diabetes. However, there isn’t enough
research to say for certain whether these medicines work for children and are safe
for them.

Weight-loss surgery is occasionally used for children, but only if they're older (in their teens) and
are extremely overweight. It is seen as a last resort and only used in exceptional
cases where an older child's health is at serious risk. Weight-loss surgery reduces
the size of the stomach, so the person feels full sooner and can only eat a small
amount at a time.

Weight-loss surgery often works for adults, helping them lose large amounts of weight.
There hasn’t been enough research to say for certain whether weight-loss surgery for
children is safe and works in the long term.

What will happen to my child?
Being overweight can make a child feel unhappy and bad about themselves. It also puts
them at risk of health problems, both now and in the future.



Studies show that overweight children have a greater chance of certain health problems,
including asthma, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and problems with the way
their body controls blood sugar levels (insulin resistance and diabetes).



Not all children who are overweight grow up to be overweight adults. But overweight
children are more likely than other children to be overweight as they get older.

This can increase their chances of having serious health problems as adults. These
include high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, osteoarthritis, and some cancers.




For these reasons, it’s important to help your child reach and maintain a healthy
weight."

https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1555315478723/Warts%20%28common%29,Warts (common),"Warts (common) Last published: Feb 15, 2022
Warts usually aren't serious and often clear up on their own. But if you want to get
rid of them more quickly there are treatments available.

We've brought together the best and most up-to-date research about warts to see what
treatments work. You can use our information to talk to your doctor and decide which
treatments are best for you.

What are warts?
Warts are growths on your skin. Warts on your feet are often called verrucas. Warts
usually appear as flesh-coloured growths with a rough surface. They’re often hard.
But warts can sometimes be dark with a smooth surface.

Warts are caused by a virus that infects your skin (human papillomavirus or HPV).
There are dozens of different types of this virus. Warts are more common in children
than in adults, as many people become immune to the virus as they get older.

Children tend to get warts through casual everyday contact with other children. So
there's not much you can do to prevent them. Some children get the virus in shared
washing areas and showers, like those you find in swimming pools or gyms.

Some people try to prevent warts on their feet by wearing rubber verruca socks or
flip flops in shared changing areas or showers. But there's no good evidence that
this helps.

What are the symptoms?
Warts are usually harmless and painless. But many people don't like the way they look,
and they can be upsetting if you get them on your face or hands.

Warts can sometimes be uncomfortable and sore, especially if you get them on the soles
of your feet. Your doctor will probably be able to tell whether you have warts just
by looking at your skin.

What treatments work?
If your warts aren't painful and you don't mind the way they look, you may want to
wait and see if they clear up on their own. But if they bother you there are treatments
that may help.

Treatments to try first
It's hard to say which treatments work best for warts, partly because they often clear
up by themselves. And many people choose to leave them and see if they go away.

But if you choose to try treatments, the ones listed below are the ones that doctors
usually recommend first. It's important to remember that many treatments for warts
can take two or three months to work. It's also important not to scratch or break
the surface of a wart yourself, as this can spread the virus.



Salicylic acid is a treatment that you paint onto your warts every day. It forms a film over the
wart. You then rub away the surface of the wart with a file or pumice stone once a
week, or as often as the instructions say to do so. Salicylic acid can irritate the
skin around your wart.



Putting a piece of duct tape over your wart may help get rid of it. Doctors aren't sure why it seems to work in
some people, but it may be that the tape deprives the wart of oxygen and nutrients
so that it dies. You need to replace the tape if it falls off. Then, once a week,
you take the tape off and rub away the wart with an emery board or pumice stone. You
then start again with a new piece of tape.



Cryotherapy means freezing away the wart. Your doctor can freeze your wart for between 10 and
30 seconds using liquid nitrogen. You can also try freezing sprays that you can buy from a pharmacy without a prescription. But these don’t get as cold
as the freezing that your doctor can do, so they are unlikely to work as well. Freezing
can be painful and can cause blistering and scarring.



Silver nitrate is a hard substance. It comes as a sort of pencil. You wet it before pressing it
against your wart.



Stubborn warts and warts that come back
If the treatments listed above don't work or if your warts keep coming back there
are other treatments you can try.



Injections of a substance called Candida antigen into warts can kill them. This treatment may also help prevent them from
returning. You will need to have this treatment done by your doctor.



Imiquimod comes as a cream that you rub into warts once a day. You will need a prescription
from your doctor for this treatment. You use the cream for between 2 and 6 weeks.
Most people find that it works well. But it can cause itching, swelling, and pain.
Some people also find that it causes flu-like symptoms and aches and pains.



Surgery, either with a scalpel or a laser, works well at removing warts. But warts often
come back after surgery. So doctors recommend using other treatments after surgery,
such as imiquimod.



Warts in people with weakened immune systems
If you have a weakened immune system, possibly because of other health problems, you
should make sure that you get urgent treatment for warts. This is because warts can
sometimes develop into skin cancer in people whose immune systems are weakened.

Your doctor will probably recommend Candida antigen injections or imiquimod cream. If you have a lot of warts, your doctor may
recommend other drug treatments to help your skin heal.

Warts on the face or neck
Warts on the face, neck, and lips are known as filiform warts. These are usually treated
with cryotherapy (freezing) or surgery. If you have surgery you will need a local
anaesthetic. Your doctor may also recommend using imiquimod cream after surgery.

What will happen to me?
Given time, warts often clear up on their own without any treatment. But treatments
can help get rid of them sooner. Some warts don't clear up on their own and these
can be difficult to treat. If you're finding it difficult to get rid of your warts
you may need to try more than one treatment.

If you have a lot of warts or if they come back after treatment, your doctor may recommend
that you avoid having your hands wet for long periods, and that you dry them properly
after washing. It's also a good idea to use clean towels when drying yourself after
you wash. This can help prevent re-infection."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/3000049/Vitamin%20D%20deficiency,Vitamin D deficiency,"Vitamin D deficiency Last published: Sep 27, 2021
Not getting enough vitamin D can cause serious health problems in adults and children,
including weak or deformed bones, and severe kidney damage.
Vitamin D deficiency is the most common vitamin deficiency worldwide and is under-diagnosed.
But it is easy to treat.
What is vitamin D deficiency?
Vitamin D deficiency simply means that you don’t have enough vitamin D in your body.
It is a very common problem. In Europe and the US, 40 in every 100 people over the
age of 50 don’t get enough vitamin D.

Vitamin D is vital for staying healthy. Foods that contain vitamin D include:


fatty fish, such as mackerel and salmon


calves’ liver


cheese


egg yolks.


But most foods contain little or no vitamin D. And even foods that are rich in vitamin
D, or ‘fortified’ with extra vitamin D, wouldn’t give us enough of it from a normal
diet. So we can’t get enough of it from what we eat.

The main way we get vitamin D is from sunlight on our skin. But you might not get
much vitamin D this way if:



you don’t spend much time outside


you live somewhere that doesn’t get much sun for much of the year


you have dark skin. The brown pigment in dark skin blocks most of the sun’s rays


you are always covered up when you go outside, or


you always wear sunscreen in the sun.


You will probably have heard that spending too much time in the sun can increase your
chance of getting skin cancer. This is certainly true, especially if you get sunburn.


But vitamin D deficiency is linked to many more health problems, including:


some cancers, including prostate cancer and breast cancer


severe kidney damage


autoimmune diseases (where your immune system attacks your own cells)


type 2 diabetes


heart disease


high blood pressure


infections, and


weak bones and teeth.


Spending a sensible amount of time in the sun, without getting burned, can help you
get the vitamin D you need to help protect against these problems. So the sensible
sun message is that:



a little sun is good for you


but don’t get burned. Avoiding sunburn helps prevent skin cancer.


What are the symptoms?
People with a mild vitamin D deficiency probably won’t have any symptoms. But that
doesn’t mean it’s not a problem. Having even a mild vitamin D deficiency means you
are more likely to get one of the conditions listed above.

People with a serious deficiency might have more noticeable symptoms.
In children, the most obvious result of vitamin D deficiency is a condition called
rickets. Rickets is not common in countries where most children get good nutrition.
It is more common in poorer countries and where there is a low level of education
about nutrition.

In children with rickets, the bones become weak and can bend under pressure. This
can cause bow-leggedness and deformed bones in the forearms. These bone problems usually
appear when the child is between 6 months and two years old.

Children with rickets or a severe vitamin D deficiency might also:


grow more slowly than healthy children


have pain in their bones


be irritable, probably because of the pain in their bones


struggle or fail to do the physical things that healthy children of their age do,
such as walking and running, moving easily, and using their hands for certain tasks




have delayed tooth development and other dental problems


have cramps, weakness, or numbness in their muscles


have spasms or seizures.


People who develop severe vitamin D deficiency as adults don’t usually have the bone
deformities that can occur in children. But they might have other symptoms in their
bones, including:



bone pain


pain in the hips, which can cause a ‘waddling’ gait when they walk


tiredness and a general feeling of being unwell (this is called malaise).


The main health problems caused by vitamin D deficiency in adults are weak bones,
which can lead to falls and fractures, and kidney damage.

If your doctor thinks that you or your child has vitamin D deficiency, or problems
with your bones caused by lack of vitamin D, he or she might suggest blood tests,
or x-rays to check your bones.

What treatments work?
Treating vitamin D deficiency is usually simple. Sensible sun exposure and vitamin
D supplements are usually all that’s needed.

In children, treating the deficiency will help bones to grow normally and become strong.
In adults, the bones will become stronger and less painful.

In most countries, most people can get enough vitamin D from the sun in spring and
summer if they spend a sensible amount of time outside and are not completely covered
up. For example, having bare arms should be enough.

But in many countries getting vitamin D in winter is a problem. Health authorities
in many countries now recommend that people take vitamin D supplements at these times.


The amount of vitamin D you need for good health depends on a variety of things, including:


your age. Older people might need more vitamin D


how severe your deficiency is


whether you are taking any medicines that can affect how your body absorbs vitamin
D



whether you have a medical condition that stops you absorbing vitamin D properly.
These include coeliac disease, cystic fibrosis, liver failure, and Crohn's disease.
If you have had bariatric (weight-loss) surgery you will also be less able to absorb
vitamin D



your body weight. People who are very overweight might need to take more vitamin D.


In children with a severe deficiency, doctors recommend a course of high-dose vitamin
D supplements for 6 to 8 weeks, followed by a lower dose that they will need to take
for the rest of their lives.

In many countries it is also recommended that very young children who are getting
nutrition only from their mother’s milk should be given vitamin D supplements.

Some people who don’t absorb supplements well might need to use a sunbed. If this
applies to you, your doctor will tell you what type of tanning bed is suitable and
how much time it is safe to spend on a tanning bed.

Too much sunbed use can cause sunburn and increase your chance of getting skin cancer.


Your doctor will also recommend calcium supplements, as calcium is essential for strong
bones.

Is it possible to have too much vitamin D?
Yes. You should not take more vitamin D than your doctor recommends. Taking too much
vitamin D in the form of supplements can cause serious health problems, including
heart and kidney problems.


What will happen?
Treating vitamin D deficiency is easy and usually produces good results.
Most bone problems in children get better after treatment, usually within 6 months.
And the earlier they get treatment, the better the outlook.

Adults also have great improvements in bone strength and other symptoms within a year
or two.

People treated for a severe vitamin D deficiency will probably need to take vitamin
D supplements for the rest of their lives."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1454670426397/Vitamin%20B12%20deficiency,Vitamin B12 deficiency,"Vitamin B12 deficiency Last published: Feb 01, 2022
Not getting enough vitamin B12 can make you anaemic. This means your blood isn’t able
to carry oxygen around your body as well as it should. And if you go for a long time
without getting enough B12 you can get permanent damage to your nervous system. However,
vitamin B12 deficiency can be easily treated with vitamin pills or injections.

We've brought together the research about vitamin B12 deficiency and talked to experts
about the best way to treat it. You can use our information to talk to your doctor
and decide which treatments are best for you.

What is vitamin B12 deficiency?
Vitamin B12 is a vitamin that you need to stay healthy. It’s mainly found in animal
products such as meat, fish, milk, cheese, and eggs. It’s also found in some fortified
foods, such as breakfast cereals and yeast extract.

Some people don’t get enough vitamin B12 in the foods they eat, or they get plenty
but their body doesn’t absorb it properly. This causes vitamin B12 deficiency. You
may be at risk if you:



are vegan or vegetarian


have had surgery on your stomach or bowels


have had a condition called atrophic gastritis, which causes inflammation in your
stomach



have a condition such as Crohn's disease or coeliac disease that causes inflammation
in your bowel



are taking medicines that stop your body absorbing vitamin B12, such as anticonvulsants,
acid blockers, proton-pump inhibitors, or metformin.



Some people don’t get enough vitamin B12 because of a condition called pernicious
anaemia. If you have this condition, your immune system attacks the cells in your
body that produce a chemical called intrinsic factor. Without intrinsic factor your
body can’t absorb as much vitamin B12 from food.

You can have a blood test to check your level of vitamin B12.
What are the symptoms?
Vitamin B12 is used by your body to produce red blood cells. These are the cells in
your blood that carry oxygen around your body. Without enough vitamin B12 you may
become anaemic. The signs are:



feeling tired


being short of breath


being very aware of your heartbeat (getting palpitations).


If vitamin B12 deficiency goes on for a long time it can affect your nervous system.
You might:



no longer notice feelings of vibration through your lower legs


have difficulty walking, or the way you walk could change


get numbness or tingling (pins and needles) in your fingers or toes.


What treatments work?
Preventing vitamin B12 deficiency
Recommendations for healthy B12 levels vary in different countries. For example, in
the UK recommendations say that 1.5 micrograms of vitamin B12 per day is enough for
most adults, although breastfeeding women need 2 micrograms. Most people will get
this amount from the foods they eat.

For vegans and vegetarians, experts recommend taking daily vitamin B12 supplements, or eating foods fortified with vitamin B12. Fortified foods include yeast extract, textured vegetable protein, soya milks, vegetable
and sunflower margarines, and breakfast cereals.

If you’ve had surgery on your bowels or stomach (for example, weight-loss surgery),
you’ll need to take vitamin B12 supplements. Your doctor may suggest regular blood
tests to keep track of your vitamin B12 levels.

Treating vitamin B12 deficiency
The treatment for low levels of vitamin B12 is, as you might expect, vitamin B12.
You might hear your treatment called hydroxocobalamin. It’s a form of vitamin B12. Another form of vitamin B12 is called cyanocobalamin.

How you take vitamin B12 will depend on the symptoms you’re getting and how bad they
are.

If you have severe anaemia or nerve problems you’ll need vitamin B12 injections. You’ll
have these around three times a week for two weeks or so. The injections will build
up a store of vitamin B12 in your body. After that, you’ll need injections every few
months to stop the problem coming back.

Your doctor might also recommend taking folic acid supplements as tablets, as these
can help with anaemia.

If your symptoms aren’t severe, or if a blood test shows you’re low on vitamin B12
before you’ve started getting any symptoms, your doctor may suggest taking vitamin
B12 supplements as pills. If the pills don’t help after two months you’ll need to
switch to injections.

Some people with severe stomach or bowel problems, and some people who’ve had stomach
surgery, can’t absorb vitamin B12 from pills. They’ll need injections instead.

What will happen to me?
Anaemia caused by vitamin B12 deficiency can be treated easily with vitamin pills
or injections. However, if you already have nerve damage there’s no guarantee that
it will get any better after treatment. You may need to see a doctor specialising
in the nervous system (a neurologist). Vitamin treatment should stop your symptoms
getting any worse.

Vitamin B12 deficiency can cause serious problems, so if your doctor has recommended
treatment to prevent vitamin B12 deficiency it’s important to stick with it."

Varicose veins are veins that are swollen because blood isn't flowing through them
properly. Many people have varicose veins. They don't usually cause serious problems
but you may find them uncomfortable or feel unhappy about the way they look.

To learn more about the causes and symptoms of varicose veins, see the leaflet Varicose veins: what are they?
Varicose veins don't usually go away on their own. If they are causing problems, treatments
can help your legs look and feel much better.

Treatments can have side effects, so you need to weigh up the pros and cons when deciding
what's best for you.

Many people have surgery to remove their varicose veins. But your doctor will probably
suggest you try a few simple things first to see if they help. These could include:



Wearing support stockings, which are tight around your lower legs, may reduce swelling and aching in your legs.

These stockings are designed to help the veins squeeze the blood back up your legs.
It's important to be sure you have the right type of stockings and that they fit well.

Talk to your pharmacist or doctor about getting the right type.


Keeping to a healthy weight may help reduce the pressure on your veins.



Exercise such as running or walking may help your veins pump the blood around your legs better.



If your legs ache, try resting with your legs higher than your heart - for example, lying down with your legs up on cushions. Avoid standing
or sitting for long periods if possible.



Stop smoking. Smoking damages blood vessels, so it's possible that stopping smoking could help
with the symptoms.



If these things don't help, your doctor may suggest trying other treatments. Surgery
used to be the most common treatment for varicose veins. But other treatments are
becoming more popular as we learn more about them.

Surgery
Having surgery can get rid of your varicose veins. It is likely to improve the way
your legs look and also help symptoms like aching or heavy and tired legs.

There are several ways to do this operation, but in the most common one the surgeon
ties off and strips out the vein or veins causing your symptoms.

It's often done through two cuts in your leg: one at your groin and the other at the
inside of your knee, or your ankle. The surgeon first ties the vein near your groin,
then removes it through the cut further down.

You'll probably be able to go home the same day as your surgery but you will need
time off from your normal activities to recover. Recovering from surgery for varicose
veins can be painful. Your legs may feel sore for several weeks.

Like any operation, surgery for varicose veins has some risks. Problems can include:


having an allergic reaction to the anaesthetic


bleeding heavily during or soon after the operation


bruising, and


having numb patches on your legs.


More serious problems can sometimes happen. For example, sometimes a blood clot can
develop in the deep veins of your leg. Doctors call this deep vein thrombosis (DVT). This is dangerous.

If your doctor thinks you have an increased risk of blood clots you may be given small
doses of blood-thinning drugs.

A rare possible risk of this surgery is called foot drop. This happens when the large nerve that runs down the back of your thigh is damaged
it can make your foot floppy and weak.

Very rarely, surgery goes wrong and damages deeper veins. This may make your problems
with blood flow worse. You may need more surgery to put this right.

Radiofrequency ablation
Radiofrequency ablation uses heat to close up varicose veins. A tube called a catheter
is inserted into the vein. A device threaded through the catheter then emits radiofrequency
energy, which heats the vein and seals it off.

This technique is becoming more widely used as research suggests that it works just
as well as surgery, with a shorter and less painful recovery.

Laser treatment
With laser treatment a catheter is threaded through a small hole in your skin into
the vein. A laser is then placed in the tube. The intense light from the laser heats
your vein and makes it close up.

This procedure is becoming more widely used, for the same reasons that radiofrequency
ablation is becoming more popular.

Injections
Having injections of chemicals into your varicose veins may get rid of them. The injections
make the blood vessels collapse so blood can't get through them.

Doctors call these injections sclerotherapy. They are often used to clear up remaining
varicose veins after surgery.

Your veins will probably look better after injections. But there's not much good research
to say whether injections can help with other symptoms like aching.

Injections can have side effects. Your skin may look discoloured afterwards. This
can take a while to go away. Injections may not work as well as having surgery to
remove a vein. Varicose veins are more likely to come back after injections than after
surgery.

Some people say the injections hurt. Some people get an itchy rash with swollen circles
at the spot where the needle went in. But this is temporary.

Some people also get bruising, swelling, and red skin patches after injections. But
injections are likely to be less painful than surgery."

Many people have varicose veins. They don't usually cause serious problems but you
may find them uncomfortable or feel unhappy about the way they look.

What are varicose veins?
Varicose veins are veins that have swollen because blood isn't flowing through them
properly.

Your heart pumps blood all around your body through blood vessels called arteries,
which carry oxygen to the cells in your various organs. When the cells have taken
out the oxygen the blood returns to your heart through blood vessels called veins.

Blood returning from your feet and legs has to flow upwards, so veins have valves
in them to stop the blood flowing backwards.

You get varicose veins when the valves in some of the veins near the surface of your
legs don't work properly. When this happens blood collects in the veins in your legs
instead of flowing back to your heart.

Varicose veins often appear on the backs of calves or on the insides of legs.
Varicose veins don't stop the blood in your legs getting back to your heart. There
are many veins in your legs, so if one doesn't work properly, others can bring the
blood back.

You may be more likely to get varicose veins if you're pregnant or if you are overweight.


What are the symptoms?
Varicose veins look like twisted cords running along your leg. They may bulge out
from the surface of the skin. They often look and feel lumpy.

You may not have any problems with your varicose veins apart from that you can see
them. But some people say their legs feel uncomfortable. This might make your legs:



ache or throb


feel heavy, or


feel itchy.


Hot weather and standing for long periods can make your veins look and feel worse.
If you are concerned about your varicose veins you may want to see your doctor. He
or she will examine you and ask you some questions.

You might need some tests to check that your varicose veins are not a sign of a more
serious problem with your blood vessels. But serious problems are not common.

What will happen to me?
Without treatment varicose veins tend to get worse over the years. This usually happens
very slowly. You may also get more varicose veins in your legs over time.

Varicose veins do not usually disappear on their own. But if you get varicose veins
while you are pregnant they may disappear after you have your baby.

Older people sometimes find that they get other problems linked to their varicose
veins. These include thin, dry, itchy skin over the veins.

Bumping a vein can be painful and can lead to bleeding. And small blood clots can
build up in varicose veins. This can cause pain and swelling. You should see your
doctor if this happens.

The skin near varicose veins can sometimes get broken. This is called an ulcer and
needs treatment.

Some people worry that they will get deep vein thrombosis (DVT) because of their varicose
veins. This is when a large blood clot develops in your deep veins, which can be dangerous.
But there is no good evidence that having varicose veins leads to DVT.

This information tells you about an operation to remove varicose veins. It covers
the different types of surgery, how much the surgery can help, what the risks are,
and what to expect afterwards.

Procedures and practices can vary slightly between hospitals. You can use our information
to discuss your surgery with the doctors and nurses treating you.

What is surgery to remove varicose veins?
This is an operation to remove varicose veins in your legs. Varicose veins don't usually
cause serious health problems, but they can be uncomfortable. Many people decide to
have them removed because they don't like the way they look.

Varicose veins happen when the valves in your veins don't close properly. These valves:


let blood flow in only one direction through your blood vessels and


stop it flowing back the other way.

When these valves don’t work as they should, blood can trickle backwards and pool
in your veins. This can cause the veins to bulge and twist visibly.

In an operation to remove varicose veins, the surgeon makes a cut in your leg and
removes the vein with the faulty valves.

The faulty valves are usually found in one of the two large veins that run just under
the skin along the length of your leg. These are called surface veins:


One surface vein runs up the inside of your leg from your ankle to your groin.


The other runs up the back of your leg from your ankle to your knee.

Why might I need surgery to remove varicose veins?
Some people have varicose veins removed because they are causing them physical problems,
while others have them removed because they don’t like the way they look.

Medical reasons
Your doctor might suggest that you have varicose veins removed if they are causing
problems such as:


pain and discomfort


swelling and discoloration, or


leg ulcers.

Cosmetic reasons
Many people choose to have varicose veins removed even if they are not causing problems,
because they don’t like the way they look. But you will usually have to pay to have
this done privately.

What will happen?
The operation usually takes between 1 hour and 2 hours. You should be able to go home
the same day.

If you are having varicose veins removed from both legs, you might have two separate operations on different days, or you might have surgery
on both legs at the same time.

If you have surgery in both legs in one operation, you might need to stay in hospital
overnight.

Preparing for the operation
Before your operation you might need to:

have an ultrasound scan before your operation. This can help to show which valves in your veins are
causing problems



stand up for a while so that your doctor can see where blood is pooling in your veins.
Your surgeon will mark your varicose veins with a pen, because the bulges are harder
to see when you're lying down for surgery



shave your legs.

You will usually need a general anaesthetic for this surgery. This means that you’ll be asleep during the operation.

During the operation
There are several types of surgery for varicose veins. The most commonly used is called
ligation and stripping. Most people who have this operation have a general anaesthetic.

The surgery usually involves removing a section of vein between the groin and the
knee, although sometimes the surgeon needs to remove the vein all the way down to
the ankle.

It happens like this:

The surgeon makes two cuts: a 5-centimetre (two-inch) cut along the crease in your groin, and a 1-centimetre
(half-inch) cut lower down your leg, usually on the inside of your knee. If you're
having the whole vein removed, the lower cut is made at the ankle.



The surgeon then finds the top of the main surface vein and ties it off at the top
(and sometimes at the lower end) to stop blood flowing through it. This is called
ligation.



A thin, flexible wire is then passed down through the vein to the lower cut. There's
a stripping tool at the upper end of the wire.



Your surgeon pulls the wire out through the lower cut. The vein and its branches bunch
up on the stripping tool and are pulled out from the knee or ankle. This is called
stripping.



Sometimes, instead of pulling out the vein through a cut lower down your leg, the
surgeon makes only one cut at the top of your leg and removes the vein through this
top cut. This is called inversion stripping.As the vein comes out it turns inside out (inverts). Because there is only one cut
with this operation, it means you should have less pain afterwards, and that you should
recover more quickly.



The surgeon then sews up the groin and the lower cut using stitches that will dissolve.


The surgeon might make smaller cuts (about 5 millimetres, or a fifth of an inch long)
down your leg and uses a hook to pull out smaller pieces of bulging vein. This is
called avulsion or phlebectomy. These small cuts don't need stitches, but the surgeon might seal them using paper
strips.



At the end of the operation your whole leg is bandaged.

Some surgeons use a fairly new technique called transilluminated powered phlebectomy.

This involves inserting a tiny light under the skin. This light shows which veins
need to be removed. The surgeon then uses an electrical device to suck small pieces
of vein from your leg.

It’s not a standard procedure in many places, but some surgeons consider it the most
suitable treatment for some people. You can ask your surgeon about this treatment
if he or she suggests it.

What are the risks?
Any type of surgery carries risks. Your surgeon should discuss these with you before
your operation.

One common cause of problems is anaesthetics. Anaesthetics can have side effects. These are more likely with a general anaesthetic.
The most common side effect is feeling nauseous (sick) for a while after you wake
up.

Some people can have an allergic reaction to the anaesthetic, which can be serious. If you have any allergies, tell your doctor
before you have surgery.

Anaesthetics can sometimes cause breathing or heart problems. These problems are serious
but rare. Your heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing will all be monitored for
possible problems during your operation.

Other possible problems
Below is a list of other possible problems that can happen with this type of operation.
This list might look long. But remember, these are only things that might happen,
not things that definitely will happen. Many people who have this operation have no
problems at all.


Nerve damage can cause a patch of skin on your leg to feel numb. This is fairly common with this
operation. But it’s rarely serious. The numbness often goes away after a few weeks
or months. But it can be permanent.If the large nerve that runs down the back of your thigh is damaged, it can make your
foot floppy and weak. Doctors call this foot drop. This is very rare.



An infection can cause pain and redness where the surgeon made the cuts. If this happens, you
will need antibiotics.



Bleeding can occur under the cuts in your skin after the operation. If the blood builds up
and clots, the area will swell and feel tender. This causes a large bruise called
a haematoma. If this happens, you might need more surgery.



Fluid build-up near the cut in your groin can form a lump. Fluid can also leak out of the cut, which
can feel wet and uncomfortable. If this happens, you might need to have the fluid
drained off.



Hard, tender lumps of tissue sometimes appear near the cuts from surgery or along the line of the removed
veins. These often go away after a few weeks.



Brown patches can sometimes appear on the skin where the veins have been removed. Doctors call
this pigmentation. It’s not common.



Patches of tiny red veins can sometimes appear on the skin's surface. This is called matting.



A blood clot can develop in the deep veins of your leg. Doctors call this deep vein thrombosis (DVT). This is usually not serious, but it can be uncomfortable. But sometimes a clot in
the leg or pelvis can travel in your bloodstream to your lungs. Doctors call this
a pulmonary embolism, and it can be life threatening.Pulmonary embolism after varicose vein surgery is very rare. If your doctor thinks
you might have an increased chance of blood clots, you might be given small doses
of blood-thinning drugs to reduce your chance of getting one.



Very rarely, surgery goes wrong and damages deeper veins. This can make your problems with blood flow worse and lead to more surgery.



As with any operation, there is a very small chance of death during surgery to remove varicose veins.


What can I expect afterwards?
Immediately after your operation
When you leave the operating theatre, you will go to the recovery area until you are
fully awake.

You will probably have a tube in the back of your hand where you were given the anaesthetic.
If you had a local anaesthetic, the parts of your leg where the cuts were made will
feel numb for several hours.

You'll be able to get up and walk around as soon as the anaesthetic has worn off.
Your legs will either be tightly bandaged, or you will need to wear support stockings or tights. You should wear these for 7 to 10 days.

It’s normal to have some bruising, especially on the inside of your thigh. This usually takes about one month to disappear.
Sometimes, a little blood will ooze from the wounds over the first day.

You might feel sore for a few weeks. Non-prescription painkillers, such as paracetamol,
are the only pain treatment that most people need.

The cuts on your leg will leave small, lumpy scars, but these should fade over time.

You might feel tender lumps under the skin on parts of your leg where the varicose
veins were removed. These will go away over a few weeks. If the lumps become red,
swollen, and painful, see your doctor.

Going home
You should be able to go home the same day of your operation.
You will probably feel tired for a few days after surgery, especially if you had surgery
on both legs.

You might find it uncomfortable to move around for a few days. If you had surgery
on both legs, it might take 2 weeks or 3 weeks before you are walking comfortably.

But you should try to walk about a little every half hour or so each day for the first
week or two. This helps reduce your chances of getting a blood clot.

When you aren't walking you should try to put your feet up, with your heels lifted
higher than your hips.

Your doctor will advise you on when you can go back to work. You'll probably need 1 or 2 weeks off.

You can have sex as soon as you feel able to. But avoid any strenuous activities or sports for several
weeks. You should be able to drive again after 7 to 10 days."

Doctors often recommend patients take certain steps to help prevent or treat varicose
veins. There hasn’t been enough good research to know for certain how much these steps
help. But the idea behind most of these suggestions is to improve your blood flow
and muscle tone.



Maintain a healthy weight, so that the veins in your legs aren't under too much pressure.




Take regular exercise (such as walking, running, swimming, or cycling).


Eat a balanced diet. It should contain enough fibre to stop you getting constipated
(straining to pass bowel movements has been linked to varicose veins). Foods high
in fibre include fresh fruit and vegetables, and foods with whole grains like bran.




Avoid long periods of standing or sitting (unless your feet are raised). If you have
to stand, shift your weight from one leg to the other every few minutes.



When possible, rest with your feet up (above the level of your heart). You could lie
down with your legs resting on three or four pillows, for example.



Consider wearing support stockings. These may help with aching and swelling.


Avoid clothing that is tight around your waist, groin, or legs. This type of clothing
can make your symptoms worse. (Support stockings are tight around your legs, but they
are designed to help your blood to flow upwards.)



Some doctors advise not crossing your legs when sitting, as this may affect your blood
flow.



Stop smoking. Smoking damages blood vessels, so it might increase your chance of varicose
veins."

https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1500138683401/Varicocele,Varicocele,"Varicocele Last published: Mar 14, 2022
A varicocele is a soft lump in your testicles caused by swollen veins. It's usually
harmless, although you might not like how it looks. But sometimes it can cause problems.

If you are a teenager, a varicocele may affect the growth of your testicles. And if
you're an adult, a varicocele could make it harder for you to father children.

You can use our information to talk to your doctor and decide which treatment is best
for you.

What is a varicocele?
A varicocele happens if some of the veins in your testicles swell up with blood. It's
a bit like having varicose veins in your testicles. About 15 in every 100 men and
teenage boys get a varicocele.

What are the symptoms?
The swelling is normally at the top of your scrotum. Because a varicocele is caused
by swollen veins, it can feel like a bunch of tubes. Some people say it feels like
a 'bag of worms'.



A varicocele almost always affects the left testicle, but you can also get it on both
testicles. It's very rare to have a varicocele on only the right testicle.



Sometimes people with a varicocele get a dull pain or ache in their testicles, although
this isn't common.



Some men with a varicocele have difficulty fathering a child, as the condition can
affect a man's sperm.



Having a varicocele as a teenager may also slow the growth of the affected testicle.
Treatment can help with these problems.



You should always see a doctor if you find a lump or swelling in your testicles. It
could be cancer. Cancer of the testicles is rare, but it's best to check, just in
case.

What treatments work?
If your varicocele isn't causing any problems, you may not need any treatment. Your
doctor may simply monitor your varicocele for any changes during regular checkups.


But if you are a teenager and it is affecting the growth of your testicles, or you
are an adult and it is affecting your ability to father a child, then your doctor
will probably recommend having surgery.

Surgery can also help if your varicocele is causing pain. There are a few different
types of operation, but they all involve closing off the veins in the varicocele.


Surgery to close off the veins
An operation to tie off the swollen veins can get rid of a varicocele. You'll need to go to hospital, but you'll probably be
able to go home the same day. Usually you'll have a general anaesthetic, so you won't
be awake during the operation.

The operation can be done as keyhole surgery, through several small cuts in your lower
abdomen. Or it can be done as open surgery, through one larger cut. Either way, the
cut or cuts will be in your lower abdomen, not your scrotum.

Once the swollen veins in your testicle have been tied off, other veins in your testicle
will take over. So the blood flow in your testicle should be normal afterwards.

Not many men get problems after an operation to tie off the swollen veins. But having
any kind of operation means there's a risk of pain or an infection afterwards. The
other main problems that sometimes happen after this type of surgery are:



an allergic reaction to the anaesthetic; this is rare


if your surgeon accidentally damages the artery that takes blood to the affected testicle,
it could cause your testicle to shrink



a condition called hydrocele, which is a build-up of fluid around one or both testicles.
Usually this goes away without treatment.



Another type of operation focuses on blocking the swollen veins. It's a smaller operation than tying off the veins. It's done in hospital, and you'll
probably go home the same day. You'll be given a local anaesthetic to numb your groin.


Your surgeon will put a needle into a vein in your groin. A fine tube will then be
passed through the needle into the swollen veins. The surgeon can then use metal coils
to block the veins. Or the surgeon can inject a chemical that causes the veins to
collapse.

Problems from this type of surgery aren't common, but some men get a bad bruise where
the needle was put in and some discomfort afterwards. It's also possible for a coil
that's blocking a vein to move out of place, although this is fairly uncommon. And,
rarely, some people have an allergic reaction to the anaesthetic.

All types of surgery work well.


About 90 in every 100 varicoceles go away in the months after treatment.


It's possible for a varicocele to come back after surgery, but this isn't common.


Teenagers with a testicle that is growing more slowly because of a varicocele have
a 50 percent to 80 percent chance that their testicle will catch up in size after
surgery.



More than 60 in 100 men who have open surgery for a varicocele have improved sperm
quality afterwards.



For men who had problems fathering a child, surgery helps about 40 in 100 men to have
children.



Surgery also usually relieves any pain people have from their varicocele.
What will happen to me?
Many men don't get any problems from their varicocele and choose not to have treatment.
But if your varicocele is causing problems, surgery can help.

You can discuss your options with your doctor. Even if you choose not to have surgery
now, you could always change your mind and have surgery later on."

​Urinary tract infections can affect the bladder, the kidneys, and the tubes that
carry urine out of the body. They can cause symptoms including pain and fever and
can cause serious problems if left untreated.

But treatment is usually very simple, using antibiotics. If you think you have symptoms
of a urinary tract infection, you can use our information to talk to your doctor about
the best treatments for you.

What are urinary tract infections in men?
In men, the urinary tract includes all the parts of the body involved in removing
urine from your body.



It starts at the kidneys, which filter some waste products in your body, which are then flushed out in your
urine.



The urine travels from your kidneys to your bladder, through two tubes called ureters.



When you urinate the urine passes out of your body through a tube called the urethra, which extends from your bladder and through your penis.



What causes urinary tract infections in men?
Urinary tract infections, or UTIs, happen when bacteria in the urinary tract are not properly flushed out in your urine.

This can happen if there is a problem or an obstacle in any part of the urinary tract,
or if the bladder doesn’t empty completely. One very common cause is prostate problems.

The prostate gland, which sits just below your bladder, can become enlarged in middle-aged and older
men. This can put pressure on parts of the urinary tract and prevent the bladder from
emptying properly.

Any bacteria left behind in the bladder can then breed and cause symptoms of an infection.
You may hear prostate problems called by various names, including enlarged prostate, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS).

These prostate problems are not the same as prostate cancer. But if you notice any changes in the way you urinate,
such as needing to urinate more often, it’s a good idea to see your doctor.

Other things that can cause UTIs in men include:


Kidney stones


Having a catheter fitted to help urine drain away, because of another medical problem. For example,
many men need a catheter to help them pass urine for a while after they have surgery



Diabetes


Previous surgery on the urinary tract, and


Problems that can make some urine flow backwards along the urinary tract.


UTIs are more common in older men than in younger men, often because of prostate problems.
But younger men can still get UTIs, often from sexual activity. Men who have anal sex seem to be especially at risk of UTIs.

What are the symptoms?
Symptoms of a UTI can vary depending on how severe the infection is, and which parts
of the urinary tract it affects. They can include:



Pain in the lower abdomen


Needing to urinate more than usual


Pain when urinating


Blood in the urine


Discharge in the urine, and


Fever.


If you see your doctor with symptoms of a UTI, they may want to do a physical examination,
and probably some tests. These may include a urine test, and possibly a scan, such
as an ultrasound.

What treatments are available?
UTIs are caused by bacteria. So the main treatment for a UTI is antibiotics, which kill the bacteria.

Most men take antibiotics for a UTI as tablets. But people who are severely ill may
need to be admitted to hospital and given antibiotics directly into a vein as an intravenous
(IV) drip.

If you need to take antibiotic tablets, it will usually be for 1 or 2 weeks, depending
on your symptoms.

Most men are cured with one course of antibiotics. But if your symptoms don’t improve
after a few days, tell your doctor. You may need different antibiotics or more tests.

What to expect in the future
It’s important to get treatment for a UTI, as they can have serious complications
if left untreated, such as prostate and kidney infections.

Some men find that they have repeated infections as they get older. This is often
the result of an enlarged prostate.

Having a catheter in place for a long time can also lead to repeated infections. You
can talk to your doctor about what you can do to help prevent this happening."

Urinary tract infections are usually easy to treat, but they can be hard to spot.
Your child might seem to be ill for no obvious reason.

A urinary tract infection can damage your child's kidneys, so it's important to see
a doctor if you're worried. Urinary tract infections can be very dangerous in very
young babies, so you should always seek medical help if you think your baby might
have one.

What are urinary tract infections in children?
A urinary tract infection (often called a UTI) is caused by germs (usually bacteria)
growing in the parts of your child's body that carry urine. The infection can affect
your child's bladder or kidneys, or the tubes that carry urine. Kidney infections
are more serious than bladder infections.

Certain things can increase a child's chance of getting a urinary tract infection,
including:



being under 1 year old


being a girl, and


having problems with their urinary tract.


At least 8 in every 100 girls and 2 in every 100 boys will have had a urinary tract
infection by the time they are 7 years old.

What are the symptoms?
It's often hard to tell if a child has a urinary tract infection, especially if they
are very young and can't describe how they are feeling. Symptoms can include:



a high temperature (fever)


being irritable or fussy


vomiting, and


diarrhoea


loss of appetite


cloudy or strange-smelling urine, and


either have difficulty urinating or needing to urinate a lot.


If your child is older and can describe their symptoms, they may say they have pain
in their upper tummy (abdomen), back, or sides, or pain when they urinate.

Your doctor can find out whether your child has a urinary tract infection by testing
a sample of their urine.

What treatments work?
Most children with a urinary tract infection can be treated easily with antibiotics.
If you think your child has a urinary tract infection you should see your doctor straight
away. Untreated urinary tract infections can be dangerous in young children.

In very young babies, urinary tract infections can lead to sepsis, which is a dangerous reaction to an infection. If your baby is less than three months
old and you are concerned about a possible urinary tract infection, seek medical help right away.

There are several different types of antibiotics used for urinary tract infections
in children, and they come in different forms.



Very young babies (less than three months old) and very ill children will be treated
in hospital with antibiotics put directly into a vein through an intravenous infusion
(also known as an IV or drip).



Older babies and young children can swallow liquid antibiotics.


Older children can take tablets.


Antibiotics can cause side effects, but these are usually mild. For example, your
child might get an upset stomach or diarrhoea. Some children get a rash, which could
suggest an allergic reaction.

Be sure to talk to your doctor if your child gets a rash or any other side effects.
What will happen to my child?
Your child should start to feel better after a day or two of taking antibiotics. But
it's important to make sure your child takes the antibiotics for as long as the doctor
recommends. Otherwise, there is a chance that your child will become ill again.

It's possible for a urinary tract infection to damage a child's kidneys. But this
is less likely if a child is treated early on with antibiotics. Sometimes doctors
recommend children have a scan of their kidneys to check for any damage after a urinary
tract infection.

Some children get repeated urinary tract infections. This is often related to other
problems, such as holding in urine for too long or having a problem with their urinary
tract.

If your child gets repeated infections, your doctor will explore possible causes and
discuss treatment options with you. Together, you can decide on the best approach
for your child."

Urinary incontinence means that you don’t have complete control of your bladder. It’s
very common. As many as half of all women have problems with incontinence at some
time in their lives.

Here, we look at the main causes of urinary incontinence, and at some of the things
you can do to reduce or stop it. You can use our information to talk to your doctor
about the best treatments for you.

What is urinary incontinence?
Urinary incontinence means that you don’t have total control over your bladder, so
that urine leaks from your bladder when you don’t want it to.

Incontinence affects everyone differently. For example, some women have very little
bladder control, while others only leak small amounts of urine when they put stress
on certain muscles, such as during strenuous activity, or when they cough or sneeze.

You might hear your doctor talk about two types of urinary incontinence: called stress
incontinence and urgency incontinence.



With stress incontinence, you might lose some bladder control when you put your muscles under stress: for
example, if you cough, run, or lift something heavy. For more detailed information,
see our leaflet: Stress incontinence in women.

With urgency incontinence, you feel a strong urge to urinate right away, and you’re not able to stop it.



Incontinence, mental health, and quality of life
Not surprisingly, urinary incontinence can have a severe impact on women’s mental health and on how they feel able to live their lives.

For example, it can lead to depression, and affect someone’s confidence to the point where they don’t want to leave their home. If problems with incontinence

If you have any degree of urinary incontinence, finding the cause can be the first
step towards doing something about it, and reducing its impact on your life.

Many things can make urinary incontinence more likely. For example, in general you
are more likely to have problems if you:



have white, northern European ancestry


are older, and


are very overweight.


But below we look at the more specific causes.
Giving birth
Many of the things that can cause some loss of bladder control are linked to giving
birth.When you give birth, it can sometimes damage the nerves, muscles, and other
tissues near your bladder. This damage is more likely if you:



have given birth more than once. Each time you give birth there is a chance that some
damage will happen



have given birth with a vaginal delivery rather than a caesarean, and


have ever had an episiotomy while giving birth. This is a cut to widen the birth canal
during a difficult labour.



Dementia
Dementia is often linked with urinary incontinence in older women.
Constipation
Long-term problems with constipation can cause you to strain a lot when you defecate
(empty you bowels). This can damage the nerves near the bladder.

If you have constipation along with urinary incontinence it’s important to see your doctor. These symptoms can be a sign of problems with the nerves in your spine.

Strenuous activity
Strenuous exercise, such as lifting heavy weights, can damage muscles and nerves near
your bladder.

Other medical problems
If you have other problems that affect your nervous system, you might be more likely
to have some degree of urinary incontinence. Conditions that commonly lead to problems
with incontinence include:



Parkinson’s disease


muscular sclerosis (MS), and


stroke.


Other health problems that can sometimes be linked to incontinence include long-term
conditions such as:



diabetes


depression, and


heart failure.


Surgery and other medical treatments
Having surgery on your bladder, reproductive organs, or anywhere in your pelvis can
sometimes cause problems with bladder control. Having radiotherapy for cancer in this
area can also lead to problems.

Medicines and recreational drugs
Some medicines can lead to problems with bladder control. These include:


antihistamines (medicines usually used to treat allergies)


antidepressants, and


medications used to treat psychosis and other mental-health problems.


Using recreational (street) drugs and regularly drinking a lot of alcohol can also
cause bladder problems. Misuse of opioid painkillers or ketamine is often linked to bladder problems.

What are the symptoms?
The main symptom of urinary incontinence is having trouble controlling your bladder.
This can mean anything from leaking small amounts of urine when you sneeze to having
very little bladder control at all.

Urinary incontinence often comes on gradually. Symptoms that you might be developing
problems with incontinence include:



a burning feeling when you urinate


having difficulty starting to urinate


finding it hard to stop once you have started


needing to push and strain while urinating


needing to urinate more than once to empty your bladder, and


needing to get up several times a night to urinate.


If you see your doctor about problems with bladder control, the first things they
might ask you are if you have had children, and how many times you have given birth.

They will also ask you about your symptoms to try to find out what is causing them.
For example, they might ask:



if you leak urine when you do strenuous exercise, cough, or sneeze


if you ever feel a strong sudden urge to urinate and you can’t control it


how much alcohol and coffee you drink, and about your general intake of fluids


if you have ever had problems with constipation


if you smoke


how often you need to urinate and if you need to get up at night to urinate


if you have a history of urinary tract infections (cystitis)


if you ever have blood in your urine


if you’ve ever been unable to unrinate even though you need to


if you dribble urine after you have stopped peeing


if you have ever had faecal incontinence


if you have ever had a vaginal prolapse


if you had trouble with bed wetting as a child, and


if you have ever had a lower-back injury.


This is a long list of questions. But they all help to point towards what might be
causing your problems.

Your doctor will also ask you about your general health, including about:



any medicines you are taking, and



any other medical conditions you have.


Your doctor might also ask about your mental health, and about whether you have other
medical conditions that might be linked to bladder problems.

They might also suggest that you keep a diary of when you urinate over a few days.
Your doctor might want to do a physical exam. This can help them to find any physical
problems. And they might suggest some tests, including testing for a bladder infection, and an ultrasound to see how well your bladder empties when you urinate.

What treatments are available?
Treatments for urinary incontinence can work well. But finding what works for you
can take time. And you will probably need to use a combination of treatments.

For example, most treatments work best alongside changes that you make to your lifestyle.
Things you can try that can help with urinary incontinence include:



losing weight if you are very overweight, and


reducing how much alcohol and caffeine that you drink.


But what someone else might call 'simple lifestyle changes' are often not simple.
For example, losing weight can be really difficult. If you need help, talk to your
doctor about the best approach for you.

There are various medical treatments for urinary incontinence, some of which are briefly
described below. For more detailed information, see our leaflet: Stress incontinence in women.

Treatments for urinary incontinence can include:


learning how to do pelvic floor exercises. These exercises strengthen the muscles in your pelvis, which gives you greater bladder
control. For more detailed information, see our leaflet: Stress incontinence: how to do pelvic floor exercises.



vaginal devices, such as anti-incontinence pessaries. These are silicone or rubber devices that support
the bladder wall and urethra (the tube that carries urine from your bladder out of
your body)



biofeedback devices, which help you to learn how to strengthen your pelvic floor muscles



scheduled voiding. This means teaching yourself how to go to the toilet regularly, to a schedule -
for example, every hour - even if you don’t really need to. It helps to prevent you
needing to go when it’s not convenient or when it’s too late



bladder training. This involves trying to hold your urine for a few minutes when you feel the need
to urinate. The idea is that you gradually increase the time that you wait, and the
control you have over your bladder



functional electrical stimulation (FES). This technique uses gentle electrical currents to stimulate the nerves and muscles
in the pelvis, which helps to improve bladder control



medicines. Various medicines can help with stress and urgency incontinence. You can talk to
your doctor about which ones might help you



Injections of botulinum toxin (Botox) into the bladder wall can help to control the
muscles in the bladder.



Surgery. Having surgery can work well for stress incontinence if other treatments don’t work.
But surgery can sometimes cause complications. You can discuss the pros and cons of
surgery with your doctor if you ever need to. For more detailed information on surgery,
see our leaflet: Stress incontinence in women.



What to expect in the future
There is no treatment that can completely cure urinary incontinence. But there are
many that can reduce its impact on your life.

Most women take a little time to find what works for them, and need to use more than
one approach. It’s also often necessary to keep up with treatments, such as pelvic
floor exercises, for the long term.

But the impact of good treatments makes a big difference to many women’s quality of
life, confidence, and independence."

Unstable angina is a medical emergency. It's a severe pain in your chest that happens
if your heart is not getting enough oxygen. This is because the blood flow in your
coronary arteries is partly blocked (the coronary arteries carry blood of your heart
muscle).

There are good treatments for unstable angina, but if it happens it's important to
go to hospital straight away, as it can lead to a heart attack.

You can use our information to talk to your doctor and decide which treatments are
best for you. To learn more about the causes and symptoms of unstable angina, see
the leaflet Unstable angina: what is it?

Treatments for unstable angina
If you get treatment quickly for unstable angina you have a good chance of avoiding
having a heart attack. You’ll have emergency treatment in hospital to prevent a heart
attack. You might need an operation to widen your artery.

When you go home you’ll need to carry on taking medicines to help prevent another
attack of unstable angina, or of having a heart attack.

Emergency medicines
You might need tablets, injections, or an intravenous (IV) drip into your bloodstream.
Medicines work faster when they're put directly into your bloodstream.

To relieve your chest pain you’ll probably be given nitrates, which relax the walls of your arteries so that your blood can flow more easily.
You will probably have a nitrate in an IV drip, for at least 24 hours.

Nitrates might give you some mild side effects, including headaches, feeling dizzy,
and redness in the face.

You might also take medicines called beta-blockers, which slow your heart down. This means that it needs less oxygen. The beta-blockers
should reduce your chest pain. They might also reduce your chance of having a heart
attack.

Beta-blockers come as tablets or injections. You might have injections at first followed
by tablets.

There are many different medicines that can help prevent a heart attack. They work
by making your blood less likely to clot. This means that the clot that caused your
unstable angina shouldn’t get bigger.

The most commonly used medicine your doctor might prescribe to help prevent blood
clots is aspirin. Most people think of aspirin as a painkiller. But it also works as an antiplatelet. This means that it stops blood cells sticking together to form clots.

If you have unstable angina, taking aspirin can reduce your chances of having a heart
attack or of dying.

Aspirin has side effects. But the benefits are probably worth the risks if you have
unstable angina. The two most common side effects are bleeding and an upset stomach.

If your doctor advises you not to take aspirin, there are other antiplatelets that
can help.

You will probably also be given a medicine called an anticoagulant. This is another type of medication that helps prevent blood clots. Most of these
medicines are just used for a few days when you first have treatment. They are usually
given as IV drips or as injections.

Some of these drugs increase your chances of serious bleeding, so you will be monitored
closely.

Surgery
Coronary angioplasty is an operation that widens your coronary arteries so blood can flow more easily
to your heart. Doctors might suggest this soon after you've had an attack of unstable
angina.

A surgeon feeds a thin, deflated balloon into your heart artery, through a tube in
a blood vessel in your groin.

When the balloon is in the right place, the surgeon inflates it so that it widens
the artery. Then it’s taken out again. Sometimes a small metal tube (called a stent)
is inserted, to keep the artery open.

All operations carry some risks. The main risk with angioplasty is excessive bleeding.
So you will be carefully monitored.

Long-term treatments
Once you get over your bout of unstable angina, your doctor will talk to you about
how you can improve your health and stop your angina getting worse.

You will probably go home from hospital with a lot of new medicines. This can be confusing.
If you’re not sure what they all are, ask your doctor. The medicines you are most
likely to need are listed below. You will probably need to take them for many months,
and maybe for years.

You will probably need to keep taking some of the medicines you started in hospital,
including low-dose aspirin and beta-blockers. You will probably be given nitrate tablets or a spray to take if you get angina pain.

There are other medicines you might need to lower your risk of having a heart attack.
These could include statins to lower the amount of cholesterol in your blood, and ACE inhibitors to lower your blood pressure.

How you can help yourself
Medicines are important in preventing heart problems. But for many people it's changes
to their lifestyle that will make the biggest difference.

If you smoke, try hard to stop. Smoking narrows the arteries and makes you more likely
to have a heart attack. Get help from a health professional, such as your doctor.
There are treatments that can help you stop smoking.

If you are overweight, try to lose weight. This might involve making changes to your
diet and taking more exercise.

Eating healthily can help protect your heart. A healthy diet should include at least
five servings of fruit and vegetables every day, and not too much fat and sugar. Eating
oily fish, such as salmon, once a week is also recommended.

Exercise helps keep your heart healthy, improves stamina and strength, and makes you
feel good. Talk to your doctor about what kind of exercise and how much is safe for
you.

Limit how much alcohol you drink. Talk to your doctor about how much is OK."

Unstable angina is a medical emergency. It's a severe pain in your chest that is a
warning sign of a heart attack. There are good treatments for unstable angina, but
if it happens it's important to go to hospital straight away.
Here, we talk about the causes and symptoms of unstable angina. To learn more about
treatments, see the leaflet Unstable angina: what treatments work?
What is unstable angina?
Unstable angina is a pain in your chest that happens if your heart is not getting
enough oxygen. This pain:



might come on suddenly


might get worse over a short period


is not caused by physical activity or is different to the type of pain usually caused
by physical activity



doesn't get better with rest or painkillers


is a warning sign of a heart attack.


You might never have had chest pain before. Or you might have had a type of chest
pain called stable angina. Stable angina usually happens when you are active but it
can also be caused by emotional stress. It lasts only a few minutes. For some people
resting is enough to make it stop, but others also need to take their angina medicine.

But unstable angina can happen any time, and it might not go away when you take medicine
for stable angina.

If you get unstable angina it is an emergency. You should call the emergency services
and get immediate medical help.

Most people get unstable angina because they have coronary artery disease. The coronary arteries carry blood and oxygen to the heart muscle. Coronary artery
disease happens when clumps of fat build up on the lining of a coronary artery. Over
time, they make the artery narrower.

If you have unstable angina, a clump of fat in one of your coronary arteries tears
open. A blood clot forms over the tear to try to patch it up and partly blocks the
artery. Not enough oxygen gets to your heart. This is what causes the pain.

The clot might get bigger. If it completely blocks the artery and no oxygen gets to
your heart muscle, it's called a heart attack. This can permanently damage your heart.

What are the symptoms?
The main symptom of unstable angina is severe pain in your chest. But it can come
on in different ways.

Often, prolonged pain is the main symptom. Sometimes it might be a worsening of stable
angina pain or a severe new pain.

The pain of unstable angina can feel as if there's a weight on your chest or like
a squeezing, crushing, or gripping sensation. It usually lasts at least 20 minutes.


The feeling is usually in the middle of the chest. But you might get it


in your neck and jaw, or in your back


down one or both of your arms, making them feel heavy


as stomach pain or as if you have indigestion


as breathlessness and sweating


as nausea and exhaustion.


If you have unstable angina you should go to hospital for emergency treatment. The
doctors will do tests, including an electrocardiogram (ECG) and blood tests, to see
if your heart is beating properly, and to tell whether you are having unstable angina
or a heart attack.

What will happen to me?
If you've had an attack of unstable angina, you might feel anxious about your future
and worry that you could have a heart attack or die. But most people recover well.
With the right treatment many people with unstable angina can keep doing the things
they enjoy.

You should still be able to drive, as long as your angina is under control. You should
check whether you need to tell your licensing authority (for example, the DVLA in
the UK) and your motor insurance company.

Most people can still enjoy sex. But if you're taking medicines called nitrates for
angina, you should talk to your doctor before taking any the anti-impotence medicines
such as sildenafil (Viagra).

Generally, if you have unstable angina or get frequent chest pains, then you should
not fly. If you're not sure if flying is safe, talk to your doctor.

Having angina can also affect certain kinds of work. For example, you might no longer
be able to do a job that involves running heavy machinery. Ask your doctor about this.

Having angina can affect some people's quality of life. For example, you might worry
so much about your condition that you can't live life normally. If you are feeling
very down or depressed, talk to your doctor. There are good treatments that can help.


Where to get more help
There are many charities and support groups to help people with heart conditions.
For example, in the UK, the British Heart Foundation (bhf.org.uk) provides advice
and support to people with heart conditions, including angina."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1438341565591/Understanding%20your%20blood%20pressure%20reading,Understanding your blood pressure reading,"Understanding your blood pressure reading Last published: Dec 06, 2021
When your doctor tells you what your blood pressure is, he or she will give you two
numbers. For example, your doctor may say that your blood pressure is '120 over 80'.
This would be written as 120/80.



The first, higher number is called the systolic pressure. It measures the pressure of the blood when your heart pumps blood out.



The second, lower number is called the diastolic pressure. This is the pressure measured when your heart relaxes and fills up with blood.



People usually find out they have high blood pressure after a routine blood pressure
check. If you have a high reading, you’ll need to have your blood pressure measured
on two or more occasions to confirm that you have high blood pressure. You should
also have your blood pressure measured in both arms.

If your numbers are higher than they should be, your doctor will probably give you
lifestyle advice on ways to lower your blood pressure (for example, through diet,
exercise, and stopping smoking). Most people are also prescribed medicines to lower
their blood pressure.

Here is a general guide as to what your doctor might recommend depending on how high
your blood pressure is. However, treatment can vary from person to person. For example,
treatment recommendations may be different for someone who is older or has other health
problems, such as kidney disease or diabetes.

Blood pressure from 130 to 139 (systolic) or 85 to 89 (diastolic)
This is sometimes called 'high-normal' blood pressure. It means you may have an increased
chance of developing high blood pressure. Your doctor may give you advice on how to
reduce your blood pressure by changing what you eat or do (lifestyle advice).

Blood pressure from 140 to 159 (systolic) or 90 to 99 (diastolic)
This is sometimes called stage 1 hypertension (doctors often call high blood pressure
‘hypertension’). Your doctor will probably offer you drug treatment, as well as lifestyle
advice. However, if you’re older (say, over age 60) your doctor may not recommend
drug treatment unless your systolic pressure climbs to 150 or above.

Blood pressure from 160 to 179 (systolic) or 100 to 109 (diastolic)
This is sometimes called stage 2 hypertension. Your doctor will probably offer you
treatment with more than one drug, as well as lifestyle advice.

Blood pressure at or above 180 (systolic) or 110 (diastolic)
This is called severe hypertension. Your doctor will probably offer you treatment
with more than one drug, as well as lifestyle advice. Occasionally people with severe
hypertension will need emergency treatment in hospital."

If you've been told you have an underactive thyroid, you may want to talk to your
doctor to find out more about your condition. Here are some questions you might want
to ask.



Why did I get an underactive thyroid?


Will I get better?


Do I need treatment?


What's the best treatment for me?


Will I need to have treatment for the rest of my life?


What are the side effects of treatment? How can I cope with them?


Should I change what I eat?

Does it run in families?



How will my treatment be managed if I wish to get pregnant (women)?"
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1189594659735/Underactive%20thyroid,Underactive thyroid,"Underactive thyroid Last published: Aug 30, 2022
Having an underactive thyroid means that your body isn't making enough of the hormones
you need to get energy from food. Some people with an underactive thyroid don't notice
any symptoms. But other people feel tired and low. Your skin may be dry and you might
lose some hair. Tablets can help replace the hormones in your body.

What is an underactive thyroid?
Your thyroid is a small gland in your neck. It makes hormones, which travel around
your body in your blood. The main hormone your thyroid makes is thyroxine. If your
thyroid gland doesn't make enough thyroxine you have what doctors call hypothyroidism.

Thyroxine helps to control how fast your body makes and uses energy from food. Your
doctor can tell if you have low levels of thyroxine with a blood test.

If your thyroid stops making enough hormones it's usually because it has been damaged
by your immune system. You're more likely to get this type of hypothyroidism if someone
in your family has it.

There are other, less common reasons why the thyroid gland stops working properly.
It can be damaged by surgery, radiotherapy, some medicines, or another medical problem.
You might need tests to rule out other causes. Some women develop an underactive thyroid
after they give birth. This is often temporary.

What are the symptoms?
It can be easy to miss the symptoms of an underactive thyroid gland. They are often
mild and quite vague. Your doctor can order blood tests to check for an underactive
thyroid.

If you have an underactive thyroid you may get some of these symptoms:


Feeling tired or depressed


Thinking more slowly or less clearly than usual


Having dry skin


Putting on weight


Feeling the cold more than usual


Having constipation


Getting irregular periods, if you're a woman.


If an underactive thyroid isn't treated your symptoms may gradually get worse. After
a few months or years, you may notice that you:



have very dry, flaky skin


have coarse hair, or lose some of your hair


put on weight, even though you're not eating any more food than usual


feel depressed


feel sluggish and find it difficult to think clearly


have a hoarse voice.


What treatments work?
An underactive thyroid gland is treated with hormone tablets. These tablets contain
the hormone thyroxine. The full name for replacement thyroxine is levothyroxine. You'll
probably need treatment for the rest of your life.

If you're getting symptoms from an underactive thyroid, taking levothyroxine will
make you feel better.



You usually take one levothyroxine tablet a day on an empty stomach. Most people take
it before breakfast.



The dose of levothyroxine you take needs to be adjusted carefully to make sure that
you don't have too much. Your doctor will start you on a low dose and gradually increase
it. You'll need regular blood tests to check the dose is right for you.



It may take several weeks before you notice any difference in your symptoms. But levothyroxine
should make you feel less tired and sluggish. If you were constipated or depressed,
these symptoms should also improve.



It is important not to take too much thyroxine. If your dose is too high you may get
an abnormal heartbeat (atrial fibrillation) or your bones may get too thin. Your doctor
will treat you with the lowest possible dose to avoid these problems.

If your thyroid level is only slightly lower than normal, and you don't have any symptoms,
talk to your doctor about what's best for you. You might not need to take thyroxine
straight away. Instead, you may have your thyroid level checked regularly.

What will happen to me?
If your underactive thyroid isn't treated your symptoms may get gradually worse. But
with treatment you should be able to lead a normal, active life.

Where to get more help
There are many organisations that offer help to people with thyroid conditions. For
example, in the UK, the British Thyroid Foundation (btf-thyroid.org) provides support
for people affected by thyroid problems."

If you have ulcerative colitis your bowel becomes inflamed (swollen). This can cause
unpleasant symptoms including pain and diarrhoea. But treatments can help control
the condition.

What treatments work?
Ulcerative colitis is a condition that can cause inflammation of the bowel. A similar
condition that you may have heard of is called Crohn’s disease. These conditions are
sometimes grouped together under the name inflammatory bowel disease.

We don’t know for certain what causes ulcerative colitis, but it is probably what’s
called an autoimmune condition. This means that the body’s immune system, which protects
us against infection, goes wrong and starts to attack part of the body.

The treatment that you need will depend on how severe your symptoms are, and on how
much of your bowel is affected. But most people will need long-term drug treatment
to control the disease, and some people will need surgery.

Vaccinations
The main medicines used to treat ulcerative colitis work by calming down your immune
system so that it doesn’t attack your bowel. But it means that you are more at risk
from certain infections. So your doctor will recommend that you have the following
vaccinations:



Influenza (flu)


Pneumococcal polysaccharide. This protects against pneumonia, meningitis, and a type
of blood poisoning called septicaemia



Hepatitis B


Human papillomavirus. This protects against genital warts and against cervical cancer
in women



Varicella zoster. You probably won’t need this vaccine if you have ever had chickenpox
or shingles.



Drug treatments
The main medicines used to treat ulcerative colitis are called 5-aminosalicylic acids, or 5-ASA for short.

These medicines come as tablets. But if your symptoms are mild you may only need to
take this medicine as suppositories. Suppositories are tablets that you insert into
your rectum, and which then dissolve.

The advantage of suppositories over tablets that you swallow is that they are less
likely to cause side effects. 5-ASA can cause side effects in some people, including
headaches, nausea, abdominal pain, and vomiting.

If your symptoms are more severe you will need to take 5-ASA as tablets, and possibly
as suppositories as well. You may also need to take medicines called steroids.

These are drugs that reduce inflammation. Their full name is corticosteroids. They
are different from the anabolic steroids that some athletes and bodybuilders use.

Your doctor will usually make sure that you only take steroids for a few weeks, as
taking them for a long time can cause side effects, including osteoporosis (weaker
bones), thinning of the skin, and diabetes.

If you need to take corticosteroids regularly to control your symptoms, you have an
increased chance of osteoporosis. This means that your bones are weaker than normal,
and you may be more likely to get fractures.

Your doctor should discuss this with you, and how best to avoid fractures. He or she
might suggest that you have regular tests to check if your bones are affected.

Some people have very severe symptoms, such as heavy or constant bleeding into their
stools, passing stools more than 10 times a day, and severe pain.

If this happens to you, you will need urgent treatment in hospital. You may need to
be given steroids through an intravenous (IV) drip to begin with. You may also need
IV fluids if you have lost a lot of fluid through diarrhoea.

If 5-ASA and steroids don’t control your symptoms well enough there are other medications
your doctor can prescribe. For example, your doctor may suggest:



a drug called ciclosporin, which helps to calm down your immune system


a type of drug called a monoclonal antibody, which helps stop inflammation in the
bowel, or



a type of drug called a JAK inhibitor (the full name is Janus kinase inhibitor). This
type of drug can help relieve symptoms for some people when other medications haven't
worked well enough.



Surgery
Some people’s bowel is so badly damaged by ulcerative colitis that they need to have
a part or all of it removed. This operation is called colectomy. You may sometimes
hear it called a bowel resection.

Like all surgeries, this operation carries risks, such as blood clots in your legs
(deep vein thrombosis or DVT) and infection. If your doctor thinks you might need
this operation you can discuss it with him or her before deciding if it is the right
treatment for you.

But some people’s condition is so severe that this surgery may be the only option
that is likely to help.

Treatment during pregnancy
Some ulcerative colitis medicines are fine to take during pregnancy, but others are
not. If you become pregnant or are planning to become pregnant you should check with
your doctor that your medicines are safe to take during pregnancy.

If you are planning to become pregnant your doctor might advise you to try to conceive
at a time when you are not having a relapse of symptoms (this is called a period of
remission).

But this is not always practical. Talk to your doctor about how you can have the safest
pregnancy. This will include eating a healthy diet and making sure you take the supplements
your doctor prescribes."

If you have ulcerative colitis your bowel becomes inflamed (swollen). This can cause

What is ulcerative colitis?
Ulcerative colitis is a condition that can cause inflammation of the bowel. It is
a long-term condition that can vary in its severity. A similar condition that you
may have heard of is called Crohn’s disease. These conditions are sometimes grouped
together under the name inflammatory bowel disease.

As well as swelling, ulcerative colitis can cause ulcers to form in the swollen part of the bowel. These can sometimes bleed or leak pus.


We don’t know for certain what causes the condition. But ulcerative colitis is probably
what’s called an autoimmune condition. This means that the body’s immune system, which protects us against infection,
goes wrong and starts to attack part of the body.

In the case of ulcerative colitis, it’s thought that the immune system attacks bacteria
in your gut, even though these bacteria aren’t doing you any harm and may even be
useful in helping you to digest food.

The cause of ulcerative colitis may also be partly genetic. This means that it might
be more likely to happen to people who have family members who have inflammatory bowel
disease.

What are the symptoms?
The most common symptoms of ulcerative colitis are:


diarrhoea that often contains blood


bleeding from the rectum


abdominal (tummy) pain.


Other symptoms that are less common include:


pain in your joints (arthritis)


fever


weight loss


constipation, which can alternate with diarrhoea.


If your doctor thinks that you might have ulcerative colitis he or she will suggest
one or more tests that can help with a clear diagnosis. These might include:



a stool test. A sample of your stool (faeces or ‘poo’) is tested for the presence
of some substances. For example, if you have white blood cells or certain proteins
in your stool, this suggests that you might have ulcerative colitis



blood tests


a colonoscopy. A tiny camera is inserted into the rectum using a thin tube. This can show if you have ulcers and
swelling in the bowel. If only the lower part of the bowel is looked at, it’s called
a sigmoidoscopy


a biopsy. This means that a sample of tissue is taken from the lining of the bowel
for testing. This will be done at the same time as a colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy.



What to expect in the future?
Ulcerative colitis is very rarely life threatening, but it can be unpleasant, and
if your symptoms are severe it can have a big impact on your life. Getting treatment
to control the condition is important.

Having ulcerative colitis slightly increases your chance of getting colon cancer.
So you will need to have a colonoscopy every one to five years. How often you need
them will depend on how severe your ulcerative colitis is.

If you need to take medications called corticosteroids regularly to control your symptoms, you have an increased chance of osteoporosis.
This means that your bones are weaker than normal, and you may be more likely to get
fractures.

Your doctor should discuss this with you, and how best to avoid fractures. He or she
might suggest that you have regular tests to check if your bones are affected.

Your doctor should also warn you about medicines that can make your condition worse,
such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen.

There has been much discussion about how your diet might affect ulcerative colitis, but there isn’t much evidence about it. If you know
that certain foods cause you to have symptoms, then you may want to stop eating them.
But it is important to eat a healthy diet and make sure you are getting the nutrition
you need.

Other things that will help keep you healthy include not smoking, not drinking too
much alcohol, and taking plenty of exercise.

Your doctor may also advise you to take vitamin D and calcium supplements. But you
should only take supplements of any kind after discussing them with your doctor, as
some of them can interact with your medications."

Tuberculosis is a serious infection caused by bacteria. It can be spread when a person
with the illness coughs, releasing the bacteria into the air. If you become ill with
tuberculosis you’ll need antibiotic treatment for at least six months. Without treatment,
tuberculosis can be life threatening.

We've brought together the best research about tuberculosis and weighed up the evidence
about how to treat it.

What is tuberculosis?
Tuberculosis (TB) is an infection caused by bacteria called Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It usually affects the lungs, although it can also affect other organs in the body.
For example, it’s possible for TB to affect the membranes covering the brain, causing
a type of meningitis. Here, we focus on TB that affects the lungs.

The bacteria that cause TB can lie dormant in your body without making you ill. This
is called latent TB infection. A person with latent TB infection is not contagious. But the bacteria might become
active at some point, making the person ill and allowing the bacteria to spread to
other people.

Anyone can get TB. But the infection is more common in certain parts of the world.
For example, you are more likely to become infected if you live in Africa, Latin America,
Eastern Europe, or Asia.

However, you might not develop an active infection until years later, when you could
be living somewhere else.

You are also more likely to become ill with TB if you have HIV.
What are the symptoms?
The main symptoms of TB in the lungs are:


a cough lasting more than a couple of weeks


a high temperature (fever)


loss of appetite


losing weight without trying


feeling generally ill


sweating at night.


Some people get chest pain, feel short of breath, or even cough up blood. But these
symptoms are less common.

To confirm if you have TB your doctor will ask you to cough up phlegm to be tested
for the TB bacteria. You will also probably have a chest x-ray to look for signs of
TB in your lungs.

What treatments work?
The main goals of treatment are to cure the infection and to prevent it being spread
to other people.

To cure TB you’ll need at least six months of treatment with antibiotics. It’s very important to take your treatment exactly as your doctor advises. Stopping
treatment too soon or not taking the full dose can allow the bacteria to survive and
become resistant to antibiotics.

You’ll start off with two months of intensive treatment, probably with four antibiotics.
You’ll then have treatment with just two of the antibiotics for at least four more
months, meaning you’ll have at least six months of treatment in total.

Your doctor might also recommend that people you’ve had close contact with over the
previous two years be tested for TB and possibly treated.

Even after you’ve started treatment you might still infect other people with TB. Your
doctor will explain the steps you need to take to prevent spreading the infection.

This will probably involve staying at home or in an isolated room in hospital for
a while. After about two weeks of treatment you’ll be less likely to infect other
people.

The antibiotics used to treat TB can sometimes cause side effects. Your doctor will
discuss these with you. Although serious side effects aren't common, there's a chance
you could get liver or kidney damage.

An antibiotic called isoniazid can also sometimes cause nervous system problems, such
as weakness or numbness in your hands or feet. To help prevent this your doctor will
probably recommend taking pyridoxine (a type of vitamin B) along with isoniazid.

You’ll have regular tests during treatment to make sure the antibiotics are working
and to check for side effects. You’ll need to cough up phlegm to be tested to make
sure you are responding to treatment.

You’ll also need blood tests to make sure TB medicines are not affecting your liver
and kidneys.

If treatment doesn’t get rid of the infection, the type of TB you have might be resistant
to certain antibiotics you’re taking. You will probably need to take extra antibiotics.

If you have TB and are pregnant or have HIV you will probably see a specialist doctor
as you might need a different approach to treatment.

What will happen to me?
TB is a life-threatening illness if you don’t get treatment. But with treatment most
people make a full recovery."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1585646128055/Trigeminal%20neuralgia,Trigeminal neuralgia,"Trigeminal neuralgia Last published: Jan 29, 2021
Trigeminal neuralgia is a very painful condition that affects the face. There is no
cure but there are treatments that can help.

We've looked at the best and most up-to-date research to produce this information.
You can use it to talk to your doctor and decide which treatments are right for you.

What is trigeminal neuralgia?
If you have trigeminal neuralgia you get sudden, short attacks of pain in your face.
They usually affect just one side of your face, and they keep coming back.

The pain comes from a nerve in the face called the trigeminal nerve. Normally this
nerve would only send pain signals to the brain if something causes you pain, such
as being struck in the face. But if you have trigeminal neuralgia, the pain can happen
randomly without any external cause.

Trigeminal neuralgia seems to be especially common in people with a condition called
multiple sclerosis. It's also more common in people aged over 50, and it's slightly
more common in women than in men.

There is still debate about what causes trigeminal neuralgia. There may be several
different causes. But, in most people, trigeminal neuralgia seems to be caused by
small blood vessels in the face pressing on the trigeminal nerve. This is called trigeminal
nerve compression.

What are the symptoms?
Trigeminal neuralgia is very painful. You get a sudden, severe, stabbing pain. Some
people describe it as feeling like an electric shock.

Most people with this condition feel the pain in or around the cheek or jaw areas.
This can include the lower eyelids, nostrils, lips, and gums. Some people feel pain
around the eye or forehead, but this is less common.

The pain can last from a few seconds to a few minutes at a time. It usually affects
just one side of the face.

Attacks of pain can come on without warning. But they can be triggered by simple things
like talking, eating and drinking, cleaning your teeth, brushing your hair, shaving,
and facing into the wind.

Your attacks may come one right after another, or they might come and go. You might
have a series of painful attacks lasting for weeks. Or they might stop for a long
time.

There is no test for trigeminal neuralgia. Your doctor will examine your face and
ask you questions about your pain. You may need to be checked for other conditions.

If your doctor is not sure about the diagnosis, you may need to go to hospital for
an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan. This can show whether you have blood vessels
pressing on the root of your trigeminal nerve. An MRI scan can also rule out a more
serious cause for your pain.

What treatments work?
There are several different treatments for trigeminal neuralgia. The aim is to reduce
your pain as much as possible. You'll probably be offered medicine first. If that
doesn't work you may want to discuss having an operation.

Things you can do for yourself
You may notice that certain things trigger an attack of pain. There may be some things
you can do to avoid these triggers.

For example, you could:


avoid sitting in the direct blast of an air conditioning unit


protect your face with a scarf when you go out in cold weather


avoid very hot or very cold drinks or food


use a drinking straw. This can help you avoid getting a hot or cold drink on the area
of your mouth where pain occurs



use pain-free periods to eat


ask your doctor for help if you feel depressed. It's not surprising that many people
who have long-lasting painful conditions get depressed. But there are treatments that
can help with depression.



Medicines
The main drug treatments for trigeminal neuralgia are medications called anticonvulsants. These drugs are usually used to treat epilepsy, but they can also help reduce the
pain of trigeminal neuralgia. Up to three-quarters of people get some pain relief
from these medications.

You normally start on a low dose and build up gradually until you find the dose that
best treats the pain. You then have to take the medication regularly. But they seem
to work less well the longer you use them.

These drugs can cause side effects in some people. The most common ones are drowsiness,
dizziness, and constipation.

If you get a rash while taking these drugs you should seek medical advice immediately.
The rash could be a sign of a serious allergic reaction.

But you shouldn't stop taking anticonvulsants suddenly without talking to a doctor.
This is because suddenly stopping taking these drugs can cause seizures, even in people
who do not have epilepsy.

Medicines other than anticonvulsants are sometimes tried for trigeminal neuralgia.
For example, a drug called baclofen has been found to help some people who didn't
improve with anticonvulsants.

Surgery
If medicines don't work you may decide you want to talk to your doctor about having
surgery. The main surgical treatment for trigeminal neuralgia is an operation called
microvascular decompression. The aim is to reduce pain by relieving the pressure on the trigeminal nerve from
surrounding blood vessels.

This operation can often be done as an outpatient procedure and usually only needs
a local anaesthetic.

As with any operation, surgery for trigeminal neuralgia can cause complications in
some people. These include loss of hearing in one ear, weak face muscles, numbness
in the face, and double vision.

Other techniques are sometimes used.
Stereotactic radiosurgery involves delivering high doses of radiation to deaden the nerve. It does not involve
any cutting but it is probably less effective than microvascular decompression.

Nerve blocks seem to be effective in most people. But many people find that their symptoms return
within a few years.

Balloon compression of the nerve involves inserting and inflating a small balloon under the skin near
the nerve. This stops the nerve from working. It does not seem to work as well as
microvascular decompression but it may have fewer side effects.

Peripheral neurectomy involves removing part of the nerve. It does not seem to work as well as some other
surgical techniques and it causes some loss of feeling in the face. Your doctor will
probably only suggest this treatment if nothing else has worked.

All these procedures carry risks. You can ask your specialist about the different
options, how well they are likely to work for you, and how likely you are to get complications.

What will happen to me?
You may have long periods free of pain. But, as you get older, trigeminal neuralgia
attacks can get more frequent and more painful. The pain-free intervals can become
shorter. And some people eventually have background pain all the time.

Where to get more help
There are various charities and support groups to help people with trigeminal neuralgia.
Your doctor may be able to put you in touch with one in your area. For example, in
the UK, the Trigeminal Neuralgia Association UK (tna.org.uk) is a charity providing
information and support to people living with trigeminal neuralgia."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1438333190818/Treating%20coughs%20and%20colds%20in%20children,Treating coughs and colds in children,"Treating coughs and colds in children Last published: Dec 06, 2021
Coughs and colds are common in young children. Although these illnesses usually last
only a few days, they can be hard on children and on their parents, who want to help
their child feel better. However, parents looking to ease their child’s symptoms with
an over-the-counter medicine might be surprised to find few options.

Many over-the-counter cough and cold remedies that were available for many years are
now not recommended for younger children in some countries. In the UK, for example, medicines containing
the following ingredients are not recommended for children under the age of 6:



brompheniramine, chlorphenamine, diphenhydramine, doxylamine, promethazine, and triprolidine
(antihistamines)



dextromethorphan and pholcodine (cough suppressants)


guaifenesin and ipecacuanha (expectorants to help you cough up phlegm)


ephedrine, oxymetazoline, phenylephrine, pseudoephedrine, and xylometazoline (decongestants
to unblock nasal passages).



These restrictions stem in part from a US review of the safety of cough and cold medicines
for young children. It found several worrying cases where children had been seriously
harmed, often because they had been accidentally given a dose of medicine that was
too high.

Also, there's no strong evidence that children's cough medicines do any good.
There are some treatments that are suitable for younger children with coughs and colds.
But you still need to take great care to never give more than the recommended dose.

Also, bear in mind that most colds and coughs clear up on their own within a few days.
Medicines won’t cure the cough or cold. They will only help make the symptoms a little
milder.



To lower a child's temperature you can use paracetamol or ibuprofen - as long as you
don't give them more than the recommended dose. Always read the labels carefully.

You should never give aspirin to children under 16 years old. It can cause a serious problem called Reye’s syndrome that affects the brain and
the liver.



For treating coughs you can use honey and lemon mixed with some water. However, you
should never give honey to babies under 1 year old, as they could develop a rare but serious illness called infant botulism.



Nasal drops of saline (sterile salt water) can be used to help unblock a child's nose.
These drops can be particularly helpful for babies who are having trouble feeding
because of a blocked nose.



You can also help relieve a child's blocked nose using vapour rubs and inhaled decongestants
that you put on children's clothing, such as menthol. But these are not usually recommended
for very young children, as they can be irritating.



It’s important to make sure your child drinks plenty of fluids while they are ill,
so they don’t become dehydrated. Warm drinks can help soothe the throat.



The restrictions on cough and cold medicines don’t usually apply to older children.
But it’s still important to take certain precautions:



Read the label on any medicine you give your child. Check the active ingredients section
of the label and the correct dose for your child’s age.



Be very careful if you give more than one medicine to a child. If you use two medicines
with the same active ingredient (such as paracetamol) your child could get too much.




Only use the measuring spoons or cups that come with the medicine.


Call a pharmacist, doctor, or other healthcare professional if you have any questions
about using cough or cold medicines for a child."

If you have a transient ischaemic attack or ‘mini stroke’, the blood supply to your
brain is reduced or stopped for a short time. It is a medical emergency that can be
a sign of other blood vessel or heart problems.
If you have the symptoms of a mini stroke you should seek medical help straight away.
Getting treatment quickly can prevent more serious problems, such as a stroke or a
heart attack.
What is a transient ischaemic attack?
If you have a stroke the blood supply to part of your brain is cut off.
The same thing happens if you have a transient ischaemic attack (TIA or ‘mini stroke’).
But with a TIA it only happens for a short time - usually less than an hour.

This does not mean that you’re okay: a TIA is a medical emergency. It’s a sign that
you have problems with your heart or blood vessels that need urgent medical attention.


A TIA happens because something blocks a blood vessel in or near the brain. This can
happen because:



a blood clot gets stuck in the blood vessel


a piece of fatty tissue (called plaque) breaks off from the wall of a larger blood
vessel, then travels to a smaller blood vessel, where it gets stuck



a blood vessel has become too narrow. This can mean that not enough blood gets to
the brain, or that small blood clots or lumps get stuck in the blood vessel.



Problems with your blood vessels can happen for a number of reasons. For example,
they are more likely if you:



have other heart problems, such as an irregular heartbeat or ‘heart flutter’ (called
atrial fibrillation) or heart failure



have high blood pressure


have diabetes


smoke


have too much LDL cholesterol (sometimes called ‘bad’ cholesterol) in your blood


have chronic kidney disease


are older


have a long history of drinking too much alcohol.



What are the symptoms?
The symptoms of a TIA are the same as those for a stroke. They usually come on suddenly,
just like with a stroke. But with a TIA they are ‘transient’, which means that they
come and then go away fairly quickly, rather than lasting a long time.

TIA symptoms usually go away after less than an hour. But this doesn’t mean that the
problem has gone away. If you have the symptoms of a TIA you need to get emergency
medical help immediately.

You can remember the symptoms of a TIA or stroke, and what to do about them, using
the word FAST. The letters stand for: Face, Arms, Speech, Time.



Face: when a person has a stroke or TIA, their face might drop on one side. They might
not be able to smile and their mouth or eye might have drooped on the affected side.




Arms: they might not be able to raise both arms and hold them up, because of weakness and
numbness on one side.



Speech: the person’s speech might be slurred or unclear, or they might struggle to speak
at all.



Time: if someone has any of the above symptoms it’s time to get emergency medical help.




If you have a suspected TIA you will probably be treated in the emergency department
of a hospital. The doctor treating you will examine you and ask you questions to try
to pinpoint what has happened.

Your symptoms may have gone away by the time you see the doctor. But don’t worry that
what happened wasn’t important or that you are making a fuss about nothing. If you
have had a TIA it was serious.

Your doctor might want to do some tests. These are done mainly to exclude other possible
causes of your symptoms. For example, your doctor might test your blood sugar, to
rule out diabetes.

He or she might also recommend an imaging test, such as a CT (computerised tomography)
or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), and an ECG (electrocardiograph) to check for
any signs of a stroke or other problems with your heart and blood vessels.

What treatments work?
If your medical exam and tests strongly suggest that you have had a TIA, your doctor
will then try to decide how likely you are to have more problems with your heart or
blood vessels.

If he or she thinks that you are at serious risk of more problems, such as another
stroke or a heart attack, you might be advised to stay in hospital for a few days.


Medicines
Even if you don’t stay in hospital, your doctor will probably recommend that you take
medicines to help prevent a stroke or other problems. These may include:



antiplatelet drugs. These medicines make your blood thinner, so that it passes more
easily through your veins and arteries. This treatment could simply be a small daily
dose of aspirin



anticoagulant medicines. These drugs stop your blood from clotting too easily. The
downside is that they can lead to unwanted bleeding. So your doctor will want to keep
a close eye on how you do, and whether there are any side effects



medicines to lower your cholesterol


medicines to lower your blood pressure.


All of these medicines can have side effects in some people. Your doctor should discuss
these with you and advise you what to look out for. If one medicine causes side effects
you might be able to switch to another.

Changing your lifestyle
You will also be advised to think about your lifestyle, and about what you could do
to reduce the chances of having more serious problems.

This is vital. Drugs can help prevent future problems with your heart and blood vessels.
But they can’t make them stronger and healthier. The things that will protect you
the most are the positive changes you make for yourself.

For example, you might be advised to:


stop smoking (if you smoke)


drink less alcohol


take more exercise


eat a healthier diet


lose some weight if you are overweight.



Surgery
If your doctor thinks that you are at very high risk of more serious problems, he
or she might suggest that you have a surgical procedure called a carotid endarterectomy.

This means that a surgeon cleans out your carotid artery so that blood can pass through
it more easily. The carotid is the large artery in your neck that carries blood to
your brain.

Another surgical option is having a stent fitted in your carotid artery. A stent is a small tube that is placed inside the
clogged section of the artery so that blood can pass through more easily.

These procedures can be important short-term measures to help prevent serious problems.
But plaque can build up again quickly in blood vessels. So you will still need to
make changes to your lifestyle and take the right medicines to protect yourself.

What will happen?
A TIA is a serious medical emergency. The quicker you get treatment, the better the
outcome. So remember the symptoms: FAST.



About 10 in 100 people treated in an emergency department for a TIA will have a stroke
within 3 months - most of those within the first few days.



And about 5 in 100 people treated in an emergency department for a TIA will die within
6 months.



These figures look frightening. But it’s not possible to say what will happen to you
as an individual. In some people a TIA is a sign of future serious problems, while
some people who have a TIA have no more problems at all.

The important thing is to give yourself the best possible chance of staying healthy.
This means changing your lifestyle if necessary, and taking the right medicines.

Your doctor will want to check on you regularly. For example, he or she will keep
a close eye on your blood pressure, to see that it’s not getting too high."

Toxoplasmosis is a common infection that can be passed on by cats. It doesn't usually
make people ill. But it can harm your baby if you get it when you're pregnant.

We’ve looked at the best and most up-to-date research to produce this information.
You can use it to talk to your doctor and decide which treatments are right for you
and your baby.

What treatments work?
Toxoplasmosis is caused by a parasite. Parasites live inside the bodies of other living
things. The toxoplasmosis parasite lives mainly in cats, although it can also infect
other animals and people.

When cats are infected, the parasite comes out in their stools, and into litter boxes
or soil, where it can infect you if you come in contact with it.

You can also be infected if you eat undercooked meat or drink water that contains
the parasite.

Once you're infected, the toxoplasmosis parasite lives in your body, but it doesn’t
usually cause problems. Your immune system protects you by keeping it in check.

And if you've had toxoplasmosis several months or more before becoming pregnant, your
unborn baby will be protected, too.

But if you get toxoplasmosis while you are pregnant, or just before, it can cause
serious health problems for your unborn baby.

If you do get toxoplasmosis in pregnancy, medicines may help prevent harm to your
baby.

If tests suggest that you've recently been infected but your baby is not infected,
your doctor may offer you an antibiotic.

This treatment is designed to reduce the chance of you passing the infection to your
unborn baby.

If tests suggest that your baby has been infected, you will be offered treatment to
prevent or reduce problems for your baby. You’ll probably see a specialist doctor.


Treatment for toxoplasmosis includes antibiotics. The antibiotics you need will depend
on how far along your pregnancy is.

You will also need to take a type of medicine called an antiparasitic. As its name
suggests, it kills parasites.

And you will also need to take a supplement called calcium folinate, which works in
a similar way to folic acid. You will need to take this because the antiparasitic
medicine interferes with your body's ability to absorb folic acid, a vitamin that
is essential for the healthy development of your baby.

You will probably take these drugs for the rest of your pregnancy. Once your baby
is born, he or she might need medicine for the first year of life, to make sure the
infection is cleared.

Things you can do to avoid getting toxoplasmosis
If you're pregnant or thinking about becoming pregnant, it's important to take steps
to avoid getting toxoplasmosis. Here are some precautions.



If you have a cat, try to avoid changing its litter yourself. Have another family
member do it. If you have to do it, use gloves and then wash your hands thoroughly.

The litter box should be changed daily. It takes several days for your cat's stools
to become infectious. Ideally keep your cat inside, or have someone else look after
it while you're pregnant.

Don't feed your cat raw or undercooked meat. Don't handle stray cats.


Avoid eating undercooked meat. Cook meat to safe temperatures, using a thermometer
to make sure.



Peel or wash fruits and vegetables before eating, and wash your hands and all utensils,
chopping boards, plates, and surfaces that have been in contact with raw meat, or
unwashed fruits and vegetables.



Wear gloves when you’re gardening or handling soil or sand. Afterwards, wash your
hands thoroughly.

other animals and people.

But if you get toxoplasmosis while you are pregnant, or just before, it can cause
serious health problems for your unborn baby.

Not all babies get infected. The risk of your baby getting toxoplasmosis is lowest
if you are infected in early pregnancy and highest if you are infected in late pregnancy.

But babies who do get infected early in the pregnancy are more likely to have serious
health problems.

Also, if you become infected in early pregnancy you may have a miscarriage (lose your
baby).

How do I know if I have toxoplasmosis?
Most healthy people, including pregnant women, don't have any symptoms from toxoplasmosis.
Some people have a mild flu-like illness for a few weeks.

In some countries (such as France) doctors routinely test women who are pregnant,
or could become pregnant, for toxoplasmosis.

But many countries (including the UK and the US) don't routinely check women for the
parasite.

If you're pregnant and are concerned that you may have become infected, you can have
a blood test. If your test suggests you have recently been infected, the next step
is to find out whether the infection has passed to your baby.

Your doctor may suggest having a test called amniocentesis. Doctors take a sample
of the amniotic fluid (the fluid that surrounds your baby in the womb) by putting
a needle into your abdomen. They check the fluid for signs of infection.

This test is usually reliable, but it is not completely safe for your baby, as there
is a small risk of miscarriage. You'll need to discuss this with your doctor.

Amniocentesis doesn't show how toxoplasmosis may be affecting your baby. If the test
is positive for the infection, your doctor will use an ultrasound to look for possible
problems.

Unborn babies who have toxoplasmosis usually look normal on ultrasound scans. But
sometimes they show signs of problems related to the infection.

What will happen to my baby?
If you get toxoplasmosis just before or during your pregnancy, your baby will be tested
for the infection after birth and checked for any problems related to the infection.


Some babies with toxoplasmosis have signs of a severe infection at the time of birth.
For example, they may have an eye infection, an enlarged liver and spleen, jaundice
(yellowing of the skin and eyes), or pneumonia.

If a baby was infected early in pregnancy, they may be blind or have other problems
related to their development in the womb. Distressingly, some babies are stillborn
or die a few days after birth.

However, most babies with toxoplasmosis seem normal at birth. But many will have some
health problems months or even years later. These may include:



eye infections


hearing problems


seizures


learning difficulties, and


delayed growth.


Treatment can help reduce the chance of these problems happening.
An eye infection called chorioretinitis is the most common long-term health problem
caused by toxoplasmosis. It can permanently damage a baby's eyesight.

If your baby has eye problems, he or she will need to be treated by an eye specialist.
New eye infections and sight problems can happen through childhood and even later.
Your baby will have regular checks of their eyes and of their hearing.

You can still breastfeed if you have toxoplasmosis. Doctors think it's unlikely that
the infection would spread to the baby from breastfeeding. The parasite that causes
the infection has never been found in human breast milk.

If you had toxoplasmosis during a previous pregnancy, you will not be at risk of passing
the infection on to your baby in a future pregnancy, as long as your immune system
is healthy.

If you, your child, or someone close to you has Tourette’s syndrome it can be distressing
and confusing for everyone involved. But learning about the condition and getting
treatment can help.

You can use our information to talk to your doctor about the best treatment for your
child.

What is Tourette’s syndrome?
When someone has Tourette’s syndrome they have what are called tics. Tics are repeated
movements or sounds that they can’t help making. For example, they might squint or
make squeaking noises.

Not every child with tics has Tourette’s syndrome. Plenty of children have mild tics
and repetitive habits that come and go and don’t cause them any problems. Tourette’s
is more severe and longer term.

The tics with Tourette’s follow a pattern:


They start with a strong urge to perform the tic.


The person then performs the tic.


The person might also need to repeat the tic until it feels ‘just right’.


There is then a brief sense of relief before the person feels the urge to repeat the
tic.



Performing these tics can be distressing and exhausting for the person with Tourette’s
and for people close to them.

Tourette’s affects the body’s nervous system. We don’t know everything about what
causes it. But it seems to be largely inherited. Other things we know about Tourette’s
include:



Tourette’s is much more common in boys than in girls.


Tourette’s starts in early childhood and usually peaks at about 10 years old.


The symptoms usually become gradually less severe as young people reach adulthood.


By early adulthood, only about 20 in 100 people with Tourette’s will still have tics
that cause them any problems.



Tourette’s often happens alongside other mental-health conditions. The most common
ones are obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD).

(For more information on these conditions see our leaflet on OCD and our various leaflets
on ADHD.)

What are the symptoms?
Lots of young children have tics or habits that come and go. For example, children
might rock themselves or make shapes with their fingers in repetitive ways. Or they
might make regular, rhythmic gestures.

Children sometimes do these things as a way of comforting themselves, and most children
grow out of them.

Tourette’s syndrome is different. For a child to have Tourette’s, they have tics that:


are both vocal (sounds) and ‘motor’ (physical gestures), although not always at the
same time



are sudden, rapid, repeated, and not in a regular, rhythmic pattern


may be less or more frequent over a period of time, but that have been going on for
at least a year



started before the age of 18 years


are not caused by another medical condition, or by a ‘street’ drug.


You might hear your doctor talk about two types of tics: ‘simple’ and ‘complex’ tics.
This really just means that complex tics last longer than simple ones.

For example:


Simple motor tics tend to be brief jerking or twitching movements, whereas a complex
motor tic can be a more complex gesture, or a series of gestures.



Simple vocal tics tend to be brief sounds, while a complex vocal tic can involve repeating
several words, echoing what someone else says, or swearing.



Your doctor will ask you questions about your child’s tics to try to rule out causes
other than Tourette’s. For example, he or she might ask:



what medicines your child is taking


whether your child is under any stress


(for girls) if the tics are worse during her menstrual periods


whether your child has a health problem that might cause them to sniff or blink a
lot. For example, some children with a certain type of asthma sniff a lot, which can
be mistaken for a tic.



Your doctor should also ask about how your child is doing at school. If your child
has trouble paying attention or focusing in class, it’s possible that he or she has
ADHD or OCD. These conditions commonly go alongside Tourette’s.

Your doctor should also ask about any other habits, phobias (fears), or unusual behaviours
your child might have. He or she will also ask about any family history of Tourette’s,
ADHD, OCD, or hearing problems. All these things can help your doctor to make the
right diagnosis.

What treatments work?
Things you can do to help your child
There are medical treatments that can help with Tourette’s. But some of the best treatments
are simple things you can do to help your child and yourself.

The first, and possibly the most useful thing you can do, is for you and your child
to learn as much as you can about Tourette’s. Understanding the condition can help
you and your child feel more relaxed about it. And learning about it together can
help your child feel that you are dealing with it as a team.

Other things that help children with Tourette’s include:


having a structured daily routine that includes lots of physical activity


good sleep hygiene. This means having a regular bedtime, and a regular bedtime routine
that is as calm as possible, and making sure your child is not over-stimulated at
bedtime. For example, using devices with bright screens, such as mobile phones and
tablets, close to bedtime doesn’t help children to relax and sleep. You could try
reading with your child at bedtime instead



avoiding stressful situations as much as possible. Stress can make tics worse.


Of course, all these things are hard to do all the time - things will happen to disrupt
even your best plans. You can only do your best. But getting into good habits can
be a big help.

If your child is diagnosed with Tourette’s you should make sure that his or her family
members, teachers, and friends know about it. The more you can do to help the important
people in your child’s life learn about Tourette’s, the better.

Medical treatment
Children with Tourette’s usually only need any medical treatment if their tics are
causing them distress.

For children who do need help, the first treatment that is usually recommended is
called CBIT (pronounced ‘see bit’). This stands for Comprehensive Behavioural Interventions for Tics. It is a form of therapy that, over time, helps people to manage their tics.

There are some medicines that can help some children with Tourette’s. But they are
not usually recommended unless CBIT has been tried without success, or unless it is
not available.

The choice of medication usually depends on whether your child also has ADHD or OCD.
This is because different medicines help with the different symptoms of these conditions.



Children without OCD or ADHD sometimes benefit from medicines that reduce anxiety,
or from medicines called neuroleptics. Neuroleptics are usually used to help prevent
hallucinations in people with a variety of psychiatric conditions. But they can help
reduce Tourette’s symptoms in some people.



Children with ADHD are sometimes prescribed medicines that stimulate the body’s nervous
system, which helps them to focus and concentrate.



Children with OCD can sometimes benefit from antidepressants. These drugs are usually
used to treat depression, but they can help reduce the symptoms of OCD and the anxiety
it causes.



All these medications can cause side effects in some children. Your doctor should
discuss these with you carefully. Tell your doctor straight away if your child has
any side effects from his or her medications.

Some parents try alternative medicines for children with Tourette’s. But there is
no good evidence that any of them work.

What will happen?
It’s impossible to say what will happen to individual children with Tourette’s syndrome.
But the symptoms usually get less severe as children grow into adulthood.

In the meantime, treatments for Tourette’s can help a lot. But it is a long-term condition
with no cure. So your child might need regular follow-up to see how he or she is doing.

If your child is taking medication to help with the symptoms, your doctor will want
to see him or her every few months to check if it is helping.

Tourette’s symptoms tend to wax and wane (come and go, or at least get more or less
severe) over time. If your child has a spell with mild symptoms, your doctor might
suggest reducing his or her medication, and using it more when symptoms are worse.

You should regularly check with your child’s school about how he or she is doing -
but you probably know this anyway.

Teenagers with Tourette’s are more likely than other people their age to suffer from
depression. So this is something to look out for and to talk to your doctor about
if it affects your child.

Adults with Tourette’s can face problems in daily life, such as with further education
and employment. And Tourette’s often goes alongside other mental-health issues, such
as depression, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), and attention-deficit hyperactivity
disorder (ADHD).

So if you are an adult with Tourette’s, it’s important to try to get the treatment
and help you need.

There are plenty of support groups for people with Tourette’s syndrome. Your doctor
might be able to direct you to one in your area, or you could look online."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1586637499816/Tonsillitis,Tonsillitis,"Tonsillitis Last published: Dec 06, 2021
Tonsillitis is a type of sore throat. It can make you feel very ill for a few days.
Both adults and children can get tonsillitis, although it is more common in children.
You can use our information to talk to your doctor and decide which treatments are
best for you or your child.

What is tonsillitis?
Tonsillitis is an infection in the tonsils. Your tonsils are two small mounds on either
side of the back of your throat. They can get infected with viruses or bacteria, but
most cases of tonsillitis are caused by viruses.

When bacteria do cause tonsillitis, the most common type are called Streptococcus. You may hear a sore throat or tonsillitis caused by these bacteria called strep
throat.

What are the symptoms?
Tonsillitis causes a bad sore throat that lasts for several days.
You (or your child) will probably have a fever. You may also:


have a headache


not feel like eating


notice white spots on your tonsils, and


be able to feel lumps under your jaw and in your neck (these are swollen lymph glands).


You may need a few days off school or work.
If your symptoms (or your child's) are very bad or last longer than three days, you
should see your doctor.

What treatments work?
Most people with tonsillitis feel better in about a week.
Taking over-the-counter pain medicines such as paracetamol, aspirin, or ibuprofen should help with your symptoms while you
recover. You can give your child versions of paracetamol and ibuprofen that are made
for children.

But don't give aspirin to children under 16, as it can cause a rare but serious illness
called Reye's syndrome, which leads to swelling in the liver and brain.

For people with severe symptoms, doctors sometimes give medicines called corticosteroids. These are strong anti-inflammatory medicines that help reduce swelling and pain.
They can be given either as pills or as an injections. They are not usually given
to young children.

Some people find that drinking warm tea with honey or gargling with salt water soothes their pain. Sucking throat lozenges or hard sweets can also help.

But don't give hard sweets or lozenges to young children, because they could choke
on them. And don't give honey to children under a year old, as there is a chance they
could develop a serious illness called botulism.

Will antibiotics help?
Antibiotics will help only if your tonsillitis is caused by bacteria. Antibiotics do not help
with infections caused by viruses.

If your doctor thinks you or your child might have tonsillitis caused by bacteria,
you will probably be given a rapid antigen test. This test involves rubbing a cotton swab on the back of your throat to collect a
sample of fluid. This sample is then tested for signs of the Streptococcus bacteria.

The test is fast, giving results in minutes, but it isn't completely reliable. If
the test is negative for Streptococcus, your doctor may do another test called a throat culture. It can take a day or two to get the results.

Your doctor may give you a prescription for antibiotics while you are waiting for
the throat culture results. That way, if the throat culture comes back positive for
Streptococcus, you can fill the prescription and start taking the antibiotics straight away.

If your tonsillitis is caused by bacteria, antibiotics can reduce how long you have
symptoms for, but only by about a day. Antibiotics may also help reduce the chance
that the infection will lead to other problems, such as a sinus infection or ear infection.

Antibiotics can have side effects, but these are usually mild. They include an upset
stomach, diarrhoea, or a rash.

What about surgery to remove the tonsils?
If you or your child gets tonsillitis a lot, you may want to think about having surgery.
Some people choose to have surgery to remove their tonsils if tonsillitis has been
interfering with their life by making them ill a lot.

The operation is done in hospital and you (or your child) will probably have a general
anaesthetic, so you won't be awake during the operation. Most people are able to go
home the same day.

If your child has his or her tonsils removed, they may get fewer throat infections
in the short term.

Surgery has some risks. You should discuss these with your doctor. They include:


heavy bleeding during the operation or afterwards


an allergic reaction to the anaesthetic


an infection, and


swelling in your mouth and throat after the surgery.


What will happen?
Tonsillitis usually clears up on its own within a week.
Sometimes tonsillitis leads to other problems, including ear infections, sinus infections,
and a rash (called scarlet fever).

Although rare, it's also possible to get more serious problems after having tonsillitis,
such as an abscess in your throat. This can make your throat very sore, and you may
have difficulty opening your mouth. Occasionally, this can cause breathing problems.
If you get any of these symptoms, you should see your doctor.

If your tonsillitis is caused by Streptococcus bacteria, you could get rheumatic fever, although this isn't common in developed
countries. This causes pain and swelling in your joints, a fever, and pain in your
chest.

If you have any questions or concerns, you should contact your doctor."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/3000228/Tonsillectomy%20%28surgery%20to%20remove%20the%20tonsils%29,Tonsillectomy (surgery to remove the tonsils),"Tonsillectomy (surgery to remove the tonsils) Last published: Aug 17, 2021
This information tells you what to expect when your child has an operation to remove
his or her tonsils. It explains how the operation is done, how it can help, what the
risks are, and what to expect afterwards.

You can use our information to discuss your child’s operation with the doctors and
nurses treating them.

What is a tonsillectomy?
A tonsillectomy is an operation to remove the tonsils. Your tonsils are two small,
almond-shaped mounds that sit on either side of the back of your throat. They are
part of the body's system for fighting infections (the immune system).

The tonsils can be removed in several ways, including cutting them out with a scalpel,
or removing them with a special surgical tool that uses heat. This method is called
diathermy.

Why might my child need to have a tonsillectomy?
Tonsillitis happens when bacteria or a virus infects the tonsils. It causes painful,
swollen tonsils and a fever.

Repeated episodes of tonsillitis can be miserable for a child. It can cause:


frequent illness and painful sore throats


a lot of time off school, and


trouble sleeping.


Having a tonsillectomy can’t stop a child from getting tonsillitis. But it might reduce
the number of episodes they get for about two years after the operation.

This might not sound like much of a benefit. But if your child gets repeated bouts
of severe tonsillitis, you might consider it worthwhile.

But the tonsils have an important job to do in children’s immune systems: for example,
they might play a role in fighting other types of infection.

So doctors are cautious about suggesting this operation. They will usually only recommend
that a child has their tonsils removed if they have had:



at least seven episodes of tonsillitis in the past year or


at least five episodes of tonsillitis in the past two years or


at least three episodes of tonsillitis in each of the past three years.


What will happen?
The operation takes about 45 minutes. Your child will probably have to spend a night
in hospital. This is so that your doctor can keep an eye out for any problems that
can happen immediately after the operation, such as bleeding.

Your child will probably have a general anaesthetic, which means that they will be asleep during the operation.

During the operation:


your child lies on their back with a support under the shoulders, so that their head
is tipped back a little



a breathing tube is placed into your child's mouth, along with an instrument to hold
the mouth wide open



the surgeon sits behind your child's head to do the operation, looking into the mouth
upside-down.



Cutting out the tonsils
There are several ways to remove the tonsils. In an operation where the tonsils are
cut out:



the surgeon gently cuts out the tonsils and uses a small scoop to lift them out


the surgeon then stops the bleeding from the cuts, using either stitches or heat (diathermy)


if your child has stitches, these will dissolve after the operation, so they won’t
need to be removed



diathermy stops bleeding by heating the blood vessels to seal them closed.


Removing the tonsils using heat (diathermy)
With this technique, the surgeon uses an electrical surgical tool that uses heat waves
to remove the tonsils.

This instrument can then be used to seal up the wound afterwards.
Other methods
Other ways of removing the tonsils are sometimes used, including:


coblation. This uses radio waves at a low temperature to destroy the tonsils, and


laser surgery. As the name suggests, the surgeon uses a laser to destroy the tonsils.


The type of surgery you are offered might depend on what is available where you live,
and whether there is a surgeon who specialises in a particular method.

What are the risks?
All operations have risks, and your surgeon should talk to you about them before your
child has surgery.

One common problem is side effects caused by anaesthetics. The most common problem is children feeling nauseous (sick) for a while after they
wake up.

Serious problems are rare, but doctors will keep a close eye on your child's breathing,
heartbeat, temperature, and blood pressure.

Very rarely, children have an allergic reaction to one of the anaesthetic drugs. You should tell the doctors before the operation
if your child has any allergies.

You should also tell your doctor if your child has had a cough or cold in the week before the operation.

Some problems (doctors call them complications) can happen during or soon after the operation, while some can happen a while later.

The list of possible complications below might look long, but remember, these are
things that might happen, not things that definitely will happen. Many children who
have this operation have no problems at all.

Problems that can happen during or soon after the operation


Bleeding is a common complication with this surgery. The bleeding is usually stopped by putting
a pad of gauze over the wound. If this doesn't work, your child might need to go back
to the operating theatre to have the bleeding stopped. Rarely, some children need
a blood transfusion.

Bleeding can sometimes happen a day or so after the operation. If this happens, your
child might need more treatment to stop the bleeding.



Damaged teeth. Sometimes, loose teeth can come out during a tonsillectomy, or a tooth can be chipped
by the instrument that holds the mouth open.



Chest infection. Small amounts of blood and tissue from the operation can sometimes get into the
child’s throat and lungs. This can cause a chest infection and breathing problems.
If this happens your child will be treated with antibiotics and possibly oxygen.



Dying during the operation. It’s extremely rare for a child to die during this operation. It happens to about
1 in every 20,000 children who have a tonsillectomy.



Possible longer-term problems
Long-term problems after this operation are rare, but they can happen. They include:


Narrowing of the area at the back of the nose. This can make breathing through the nose more difficult.



Your child’s voice might sound nasal. Speech therapy can help with this.



Difficulty swallowing and pain in parts of the face can last for some months or even years. Some children need an operation to treat
these problems.



What to expect afterwards
Your child will probably need to stay in hospital overnight.
They will be able to drink and will be encouraged to eat normally as soon as possible.
This can help with the healing process.

After about 12 hours, a white or yellowish membrane (thin skin) appears where the
tonsils were. It's nothing to worry about and isn't a sign of infection. It's just
new skin growing over the wound.

Will my child be in pain?
Your child won't feel any pain during the operation but they will have a very sore throat afterwards. They might find it hard to swallow.

Your child's jaw and mouth might also hurt because their mouth was held wide open
during the operation.

The sore throat usually gets worse after the first day and can sometimes last for
more than a week before it gets better.

Your child will be given regular doses of painkillers while in hospital. If these
don't work well enough, it's important to tell the nurse. Being in pain can slow your
child's recovery.

For example, some children might refuse to eat if their throat hurts. Or they might
need to stay in hospital longer.

Going home
When you get home, your child will probably feel a little unwell and have bad breath
for a few days. Your child might also have earache for a few days. If painkillers don't work, you should see your doctor, as your child
might have an ear infection.

If your child's throat starts to bleed again, they need to go to hospital to make sure it's not serious.

Most children need a couple of weeks to get back to normal. It's best to keep your
child off school for this time so they don't mix with other people who might have
coughs or colds.

Encourage your child to eat as normally as possible. Although it might be painful, eating foods such as toast and cereal can help healing
by scraping away dead tissue.

The thin white skin where the tonsils used to be will stay for about 10 days to 14
days.

This new skin can sometimes become infected. This will be painful, and your child will have a fever and bad breath. If you think
your child has an infection, call your doctor. Your child will need treatment with
antibiotics."

Having tinnitus can be upsetting and frustrating. There is no single treatment that
will cure it completely. But there are things you can do to help you cope with tinnitus.

What is tinnitus?
If you have tinnitus you hear ringing or other sounds in your ears most of the time,
when there is nothing outside causing the noise. Some people hear the sounds in both
ears and some people hear them in one ear only. It doesn't harm your ears.

Tinnitus is a symptom, not a disease. This can make it hard to treat. Many things
can cause tinnitus, including:



damage to the ear from being exposed to loud noise (for example, from machinery or
loud music)



ear infection or blockage (for example, from ear wax)


some medicines, especially non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. This is the group
of drugs that includes ibuprofen and naproxen.



a condition called Menière's disease. This can also cause dizziness and hearing loss.


a type of benign (non-cancerous) growth called an acoustic neuroma. These slow-growing
lumps can cause tinnitus if they press on the nerve that carries sounds to the brain.




Many people who get tinnitus have lost some of their hearing.
What are the symptoms?
You may hear noises in your ears, such as ringing, roaring, clicking, hissing, and
buzzing.

The sounds happen most of the time, but they can come and go. If the tinnitus is very
bad, it may be difficult to concentrate or sleep.

Your doctor will refer you for a hearing test. You should also have your ears checked
to see if wax or an infection is causing the tinnitus. You may need another test,
called a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, to see if something in your ear or
brain is causing the problem (for example, an acoustic neuroma).

What treatments work?
There is no treatment that can get rid of tinnitus altogether. But there are lots
of things you can try to improve it, so that it doesn't take over your life. Many
people find their tinnitus bothers them less once they know it is not caused by anything
dangerous.

Tinnitus can cause problems such as anxiety, loss of sleep, and depression. Treatment
is often aimed at reducing these effects of tinnitus.

You may be offered a type of psychotherapy or 'talking treatment' called cognitive behavioural therapy to help you cope with tinnitus. This therapy helps you to adjust to having tinnitus
and worry about it less.

A hearing aid may help if you have hearing loss. You can also try a masking device, to make the tinnitus sounds less intrusive. This can be helpful if tinnitus is making
it hard to get to sleep or to work. You can get masking machines that are small and
worn near the ear, like a hearing aid. Some people find it helpful to play quiet background
music.

Antidepressant medicines can be helpful if you have depression or anxiety as well
as tinnitus. But they have side effects and they may not work if you do not have depression
or anxiety.

Some people try alternative treatments, such as hypnosis and acupuncture. There isn't
much good research about whether they work, but they seem to help some people.

What will happen to me?
Most people learn to manage their tinnitus well, and you may find it gets less intrusive
and troublesome over time. Your doctor will make sure it is not being caused by a
serious problem.

You may need to try a few options before you find a way of dealing with tinnitus that
works for you."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1503911004949/Thrush,Thrush,"Thrush Last published: Nov 28, 2018
If you have thrush, you get a discharge from your vagina. You may also feel itchy
and sore. Thrush is usually easy to get rid of, but some women find it keeps coming
back.

This information is about thrush that affects your vagina. It's also possible to get
a similar infection that affects other parts of your body, such as your mouth.

What is thrush?
Thrush (also called candidiasis) is usually caused by a type of yeast called Candida albicans. Candida lives naturally in your body. But if too much of this yeast grows in your
vagina, it causes thrush.

Thrush isn’t usually serious. But if it doesn't go away with treatment, or keeps coming
back, there's a chance it could be a sign of another health problem. See your doctor
if this happens.

Doctors don't normally think of thrush as a sexually transmitted infection. A few
men get a rash on their penis after sex with a woman who has thrush. This can be easily
treated by an antifungal cream. If both partners have thrush, they can re-infect each
other, so they should both get treatment at the same time.

Women often get thrush after being treated with antibiotics.
What are the symptoms?
The most common symptom of thrush is a discharge from your vagina. This is usually
thick and white, but some women get a watery discharge. The area outside your vagina
may also feel sore and itchy.

A lot of women treat thrush themselves. If you have symptoms for the first time, or
aren't sure what's causing your symptoms, see your doctor.

What treatments work?
Things you can do for yourself
The yeast that causes thrush grows best in warm, moist conditions. So, wearing loose,
cotton underclothes and stockings rather than tights may help prevent thrush.

If you have diabetes, you may be more likely to get thrush. If you get thrush often,
ask your doctor for a diabetes test.

Some people think the type of contraceptive you use affects your chance of getting
thrush. You might want to ask your doctor about trying a different contraceptive if
your thrush keeps coming back.

Drug treatments
Some drugs for thrush come as a cream or a pessary (a tablet you put in your vagina). Others come as tablets you swallow. Tablets you
take by mouth work just as well as treatments you put in your vagina.

You can buy some of these drugs from a pharmacy, but others need to be prescribed
by your doctor.

You put the pessaries in at night. It's fine to use them during your period. You can
get combination packs containing pessaries to treat the infection and a cream to help
with irritation.

You may only need one dose. Most women don't get side effects, but you could get irritation
in your vagina. There's also a chance that creams or pessaries could damage condoms
or diaphragms.

Anti-fungal tablets that contain fluconazole can clear up thrush with one dose. You can ask your doctor
for a prescription or buy them at a pharmacy. Some women get side effects, such as
a headache, abdominal pain, or nausea. You shouldn't take fluconazole if you're pregnant.

If you keep getting thrush, your doctor might suggest you keep using your medicine
regularly.

Other treatments
Some women try natural remedies for thrush, including tea tree oil, garlic, and yoghurt.
We don’t know if these really help. Putting these substances inside your vagina could
cause irritation.

What will happen to me?
Thrush usually clears up with treatment. Even without treatment, it will probably
go away on its own.

Thrush doesn't cause any long-term damage. If you're pregnant and have thrush, it
won't hurt your baby."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1454683736620/Threadworm,Threadworm,"Threadworm Last published: Jan 17, 2022
Threadworm infection is common, especially in school-age children. The most common
sign of infection is an itchy bottom, around the anus. The symptoms of a threadworm
infection can be annoying, but the condition is easily treated with two doses of medicine.
The whole family should be treated to avoid passing the infection around.

We've brought together the research about threadworm infection and talked to experts
about the best way to treat it. You can use our information to talk to your doctor
and decide which treatments are best for you.

What is threadworm infection?
Threadworms are tiny parasites that live in the lower part of the gut, near the anus.
Female threadworms come out at night and lay eggs around the anus. This can cause
intense itching.

When you scratch – and this can happen in your sleep – the eggs get onto your hands.
They can then be passed on or swallowed, and the worms then hatch again in the gut.


Threadworm infection sounds unpleasant but it’s very common, especially among school-age
children and their parents. Threadworms are very unlikely to cause any harm, except
the discomfort from itching.

You may also hear threadworms called pinworms.
What are the symptoms?
Many people with threadworm infection don’t have any symptoms. If you do get symptoms
you’re most likely to have a very itchy bottom, around the anus. The area may be red
and marked by scratching.

In children who are too young to say what’s wrong, you may notice that they are restless
or can’t sleep at night.

Your doctor may be able to diagnose you or your child with threadworms just by your
description of the symptoms. But you may need to do a ‘tape test’. This means you
put a small piece of transparent sticky tape over the skin around the anus, first
thing in the morning. It can then be checked under a microscope for threadworm eggs.


What treatments work?
The usual treatment is a dose of a type of medicine called an anthelmintic to kill
the threadworms.

The medicine comes as tablets or as a liquid. You need two doses, with two weeks between
each dose. That’s because the medicine kills the threadworms but not their eggs, so
you need the second dose to kill any newly hatched worms. More than 9 in 10 people
treated with two doses of this medicine get rid of the infection.

Side effects are rare, but some people get tummy pain or diarrhoea.
You can’t take some of these medicines if you’re pregnant. If you are pregnant, you
may be given a medicine called pyrantel, which also works to kill threadworms.

Because threadworms spread easily between family members, your doctor may recommend
that the whole family is treated, even if just one person is infected.

Things you can do for yourself
Getting a threadworm infection doesn’t mean you have poor hygiene. The condition is
common and anyone can get it. But there are some simple hygiene measures you can take
to reduce the chance of getting re-infected.



Wash hands frequently, especially before eating or preparing food.


Discourage your child from sucking their thumb, biting their nails, or scratching
around their bottom when they have an infection.



Keep fingernails short and clean.


If you or your child has an infection, wash all your underwear and bed linen promptly.
Avoid shaking the clothes and bed linen before you wash them, as this could spread
the eggs around.



What will happen to me or my child?
Threadworm infection is easy to get rid of with treatment. But it’s quite common for
people to get another threadworm infection. Your child may pick them up from other
children, typically at school. The treatment is the same as for the first infection.
Threadworm infection tends to become less common as children get older."

If you've been diagnosed with testicular cancer, you may want to talk to your doctor
to find out more. Here are some questions you might want to ask:



Are you sure it's cancer? Do I need some more tests?


How advanced is my cancer? What stage is it?


What kind of cancer cells are in the tumour? Will this affect the treatment I need?


Will I need an operation to remove the affected testicle?


What will happen during the operation?


If I have the affected testicle removed, will I be able to have an implant to replace
it? Will it feel the same as a real testicle?



Is there a chance I could need both testicles removed? If this happens, what treatment
will I need to have a normal sex life?



Will I need surgery on my lymph nodes?


How long will I need to spend in hospital?


How long will it take me to recover from the operation?


Will I need chemotherapy or radiotherapy after surgery?


Will I need to stay in hospital for chemotherapy or radiotherapy? Or can I go home
after each session?



Will treatment affect my sex life?


Will my treatment affect whether I can have children?


Can I have my sperm frozen before I start treatment?


Could my cancer come back in my other testicle or somewhere else in my body?


Should I examine my remaining testicle regularly in case the cancer comes back there?
If so, how should I do this and how often?



Will I need to have regular follow-ups?"

It can be frightening to hear your doctor talk about cancer. But most men with testicular
cancer make a full recovery, even when the cancer is advanced. And most men can still
have sex and father children afterwards.

You can use our information to talk to your doctor about which treatments are right
for you.

What is testicular cancer?
Testicular cancer causes the cells in a testicle to grow out of control. These cells
form a lump called a tumour. If it's not treated, cancer cells could break off from
the tumour and spread to other parts of your body.

It might be worrying to hear your doctor talking about cancer cells spreading in your
body. But testicular cancer is much easier to treat than most types of cancer. Even
men whose cancer is at a late stage stand a good chance of being cured.

What are the symptoms?
The most common symptom of testicular cancer is a lump or swelling in your testicle.
It's rare to get cancer in both testicles, so the lump is usually just on one side.
Some men don't notice a lump but find that one testicle has got bigger or smaller.
This lump is not usually painful.

Your doctor may use letters and numbers to describe your cancer. This is called staging.
It's a kind of shorthand to describe how far the cancer has spread in your body -
what stage it's at.

Remember, even testicular cancer that's spread outside your testicle can very often
be completely cured.

What treatments work?
The first treatment you'll probably need is an operation to remove the testicle that
has cancer. Men who have very small tumours might just be able to have the tumour
removed, rather than the whole testicle. But this is rare.

You may not like the idea of having a testicle removed, but it's a simpler operation
than you might expect. Your other testicle can make all the hormones and sperm that
you need for having sex and fathering children.

After surgery you may need radiotherapy or chemotherapy (treatment with anti-cancer
drugs). But some men with early-stage cancer will be cured after surgery alone.

Surgery
Most men need an operation to remove the testicle that has cancer.
Before surgery you'll be given a general anaesthetic. The surgeon will make a cut
low down on your abdomen, near your groin. He or she will be able to reach your testicle
through this cut.

You may be worried that your testicles will look different after surgery. But you're
unlikely to need a cut in your scrotum. And you can have an artificial testicle to
replace the one that's been removed.

You'll probably spend a couple of days recovering in hospital. You should also allow
three or four weeks of recovery time at home. You'll be given painkillers to help
with any pain you get.

Like all operations, surgery to remove a testicle carries some risks. These don't
happen often, but your doctor should discuss them with you. Some possible problems
after your operation are:



bleeding


an infection


severe bruising (called a haematoma), or


nerve damage (this could cause a numb feeling in your groin).


Some men need another operation to remove any cancer that has spread to their lymph
nodes. Lymph nodes help your body to fight disease. The ones that may need to be removed
are in the area between your belly button (navel) and your back.

Your doctor might recommend lymph node surgery for one of several reasons, including
the type of tumour you have.

For men who do need their lymph nodes removed, it used to be quite common to get some
nerve damage during the operation. Nerve damage can cause a problem called dry climax.
It means that no fluid comes out of your penis when you have an orgasm.

Newer ways of removing lymph nodes help to prevent side effects.
Watchful waiting after surgery
For some men with early cancer an operation will be the only treatment they need.
If your doctor thinks you're likely to have been totally cured by your operation,
he or she may suggest what's called 'watchful waiting'. This is when you have regular
check-ups rather than more treatment.

Watchful waiting means you avoid the side effects of radiotherapy and chemotherapy.
But there is a greater chance that your cancer will come back. If your cancer does
come back you'll still be able to have radiotherapy or chemotherapy to get rid of
it.

If watchful waiting is an option, you and your doctor can talk about what's important
to you. You may want to avoid the risk of side effects. Or you may not like the idea
that your cancer could come back. The decision will be yours.

Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy uses anti-cancer drugs to kill cancer cells. It's used to get rid of
any cancer that might be left in your body after surgery.

Chemotherapy drugs are usually given as a drip. Each dose of chemotherapy is called
a cycle. It's given over a few days. The number of cycles you need depends on how
far your cancer has spread.

Unlike with some other types of cancer, testicular cancer that isn't cured with the
first treatment can often be cured with what doctors call 'second-line' chemotherapy.

Chemotherapy drugs have side effects. Common problems include nausea and diarrhoea.
Higher doses can cause:


inflammation (swelling) in your mouth


hair loss, and


anaemia, which can make you feel tired.


Radiotherapy
Radiotherapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill any cancer cells that could be left behind
after surgery. You'll need to go to hospital for treatment. A large machine generates
the x-rays. Having radiotherapy isn't painful during treatment.

You'll have short bursts of treatment several days a week for a few weeks. You may
be given a lower dose of radiation if you have earlier-stage testicular cancer. This
reduces the chance of side effects.

One of the most common side effects of radiotherapy is feeling very tired. It can
also cause nausea. If you are having radiotherapy your doctor may suggest that you
take drugs that control the nausea.

What will happen to me?
There's a very good chance that your testicular cancer can be completely cured. The
percentage of men who recover from early-stage testicular cancer is getting close
to 100 percent. And even men whose cancer has spread are likely to make a full recovery.

Will I be able to have sex?
Yes. Treatment for testicular cancer will not affect your ability to have sex.
But you might not get back to normal straight away. Testicular cancer is a serious
illness and treatment can be tiring. All these things can affect your attitude to
life, including how you feel about sex.

Will I be able to have children?
Whatever treatment you have, before it starts, you should be able to have your sperm
frozen if you choose to. If your doctor doesn't mention this, be sure to ask about
it.

If your partner has problems becoming pregnant after you've had treatment for testicular
cancer, talk to your doctor about fertility treatments.

Many men go on to father children after having testicular cancer.
But the treatments can reduce your chances of fathering children. Both chemotherapy
and radiotherapy can damage your sperm. But this damage is often temporary.

If you intend to have children your doctor will probably advise you not to get your
partner pregnant for some time after your treatment finishes.

You may be asked to wait six months or a year. That's because there could be a chance
of birth defects in the baby if your sperm have been damaged. Waiting for a while
gives your sperm time to get back to normal.

If you're one of the few men who need both testicles removed you won't be able to
father children after your operation. But you can still have your sperm frozen before
surgery."

Most people get headaches from time to time, and tension-type headaches are among
the most common.

These headaches are usually fairly mild, and most people are able to get rid of them
by taking over-the-counter painkillers, such as paracetamol and ibuprofen. However,
if people get these headaches frequently, they may need other treatments.

You can use it to talk to your doctor or pharmacist and decide which treatments are
right for you.

What are tension-type headaches?
Tension-type headaches often happen when you're feeling stressed, tired, or angry.
Some doctors think the pain is caused by tension in the muscles of your neck or your
head.

For most people, these headaches don't happen often, and they are more of a nuisance
than a problem. However, tension-type headaches can become more of an issue if someone
gets them frequently - say, at least seven or eight times a month.

What are the symptoms?
A tension-type headache usually feels like an ordinary headache. Some people say it's
as if a band is pressing on both sides of their head. The pain isn't usually throbbing.


Tension-type headaches are different from migraines. For example, unlike migraines,
tension-type headaches don't tend to get worse if you move around and don't usually
cause nausea and vomiting.

What treatments work?
Over-the-counter painkillers are the main treatment for relieving occasional tension-type
headaches. However, if you get these headaches frequently, you may need treatments
to help prevent them.

Treatments to relieve tension-type headaches
Many people take over-the-counter painkillers to help with the occasional tension-type headache. You may hear these medicines called
analgesics. They include paracetamol, ibuprofen, and aspirin. Another option is naproxen, which
is available on prescription.

But taking painkillers more than a few times a week can actually lead to more headaches.
You might hear these called rebound headaches.

So you need to be cautious about how often you use these medicines if you get headaches
frequently. If you take painkillers regularly, talk to your doctor. They will be able
to help you find another treatment.

Treatments to prevent tension-type headaches
Things you can try yourself
People who regularly take exercise are less likely to get tension-type headaches. If you often get these headaches,
you could try walking, swimming, jogging, or cycling to help prevent them.

You could also keep a diary of your headaches. This can help you spot the things that trigger your headaches,
so you can try to avoid them. Stress and mental tension are common triggers. Other
possible triggers include being hungry, and using a computer for a long period of
time.

Medicines to prevent headaches
If you get frequent tension-type headaches (about eight times a month or more) and
other things haven't helped, your doctor may recommend taking medicines to help prevent
them. These medicines all require a prescription.

Some antidepressant drugs can help prevent these headaches. Taking one of these drugs regularly can mean
you get fewer headaches. The headaches you do have should also get better faster.

If you have this treatment, your doctor will start you on a low dose and increase
it gradually if needed.

You'll probably take an antidepressant for about six months. After this time, your
doctor may want to see how you get on without the drug. If your headaches come back,
you'll be able to start treatment again.

Antidepressants can cause side effects. These can include feeling sleepy, getting a dry mouth, and putting on weight.

Taking antidepressants can make some people, especially those under 18, more likely
to think about suicide or self-harm. This is more likely in the early stages of your treatment, or if your dose is changed.

If you're taking an antidepressant and are worried about any thoughts or feelings
you have, see your doctor straight away.

Medicines called muscle relaxants have been tried for tension-type headaches, but there isn't much evidence that they
help. So your doctor is not likely to suggest them.

Other treatments
There are several non-drug treatments that you might try to help prevent tension-type
headaches.

Cognitive behaviour therapy is a talking treatment that is sometimes used to help people cope with stress. If
your tension-type headaches are triggered by stress, this therapy could help you feel
better.

Relaxation training and biofeedback are used to teach you how to relax. This could relieve the tension that might be
triggering your headaches.

In biofeedback, you wear an electrical device that tells you how tense your muscles
are. When you relax, you get a signal, such as a beep. Eventually, you learn to relax
without the device.

Some research suggests a treatment called mindfulness therapy might also help. This often involves combining meditation, body awareness, and yoga
to reduce stress.

Other treatment options include acupuncture, physiotherapy, and spinal manipulation. However, there's not much good research on whether these can help.

What will happen to me?
Tension-type headaches are usually fairly mild. But if they happen a lot, they may
interfere with your work or your social life. Getting treatment can help.

Tension-type headaches tend to happen less often as people get older."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1577268197281/Tennis%20elbow,Tennis elbow,"Tennis elbow Last published: Apr 25, 2022
Tennis elbow can be painful and can stop you using your arm normally. But there's
a good chance your elbow will get better with time, and there are treatments that
can help with the pain.

What is tennis elbow?
Tennis elbow causes pain on the outside of your arm, around the bony part of your
elbow. It happens when you damage the tendons that connect your arm muscles to the
bone of your elbow.

You can damage these tendons by doing anything that strains your elbow. Playing tennis
is a common cause, which is why it's called tennis elbow.

But any activity that uses your forearm a lot (for example, using a screwdriver) can
cause tennis elbow. The damage often happens slowly over time.

What are the symptoms?
You get pain when you move your elbow, especially when you hold something or twist
your arm. You may not be able to grip as well as normal.

You're most likely to get tennis elbow in the arm you use most (your right arm if
you're right handed). The pain may come and go.

You should see your doctor if your elbow isn't any better after a few weeks. If you
have a fever, or if your elbow is red and swollen, see your doctor straight away.

What treatments work?
Rest the elbow as much as possible for about six weeks, and avoid doing repeated twisting movements.
Talk to your doctor for advice if your work will make it hard to do this.

An ice pack may help. You may also want to use a forearm strap to brace the arm and support it.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may help with the pain. You can buy NSAIDs such as ibuprofen from a pharmacy, or
your doctor may prescribe one. NSAIDs can have side effects, including an upset stomach.


If your pain does not improve using these treatments for six weeks, you may need physiotherapy, to teach you exercises to strengthen your arm.

Steroid injections have been tried for tennis elbow, but doctors usually don't recommend them.

Steroids (the full name is corticosteroids) and powerful anti-inflammatory drugs.
Although they can reduce pain in the short term, it's possible that they make the
condition worse in the long term.

Surgery is sometimes used for people with severe tennis elbow that doesn't get better after
many months.

Another possible treatment for tennis elbow that doesn't improve over time is extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT). This involves using high-energy shock waves to relieve pain and help you to move
more easily. But this is a fairly new treatment and there isn't much research yet
on how well it works.

Another fairly new treatment involves injecting the area with blood products such
as platelet-rich plasma to promote healing. But again, there isn't much research yet about how well it works.

You can ask your doctor about any of these treatments that you think might help you.
What will happen to me?
There's a good chance that your tennis elbow will get better over time. Most people
get better with treatments including rest, ice, NSAID drugs, and a forearm strap.
But some people need physiotherapy and a few need surgery."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1454682191393/Temporomandibular%20joint%20syndrome%20%28clicking%20jaw%29,Temporomandibular joint syndrome (clicking jaw),"Temporomandibular joint syndrome (clicking jaw) Last published: Oct 10, 2022
Your jaw is a complicated joint. It’s fairly common to get problems like a painful
or clicking jaw, or even a locking jaw. Doctors call these symptoms temporomandibular
joint syndrome. There’s no simple cure for the problem, but there are treatments that
can help, and the symptoms often improve over time. Surgery is usually a last resort
for people with severe jaw problems.

We've brought together the research about temporomandibular joint syndrome (clicking
jaw) and talked to experts about how to treat it. You can use our information to talk
to your doctor and decide which treatments are best for you.

What is temporomandibular joint syndrome?
If you have temporomandibular joint syndrome you may get a clicking sound when you
move your jaw. You may also get pain in your jaw or face. Some people find they can’t
move their jaw properly or can’t open their mouth as wide as they used to.

There are three main types of temporomandibular joint syndrome:


Pain that comes from the muscles you use to chew.


Misalignment of a disc in your jaw. Normally, a disc sits between your skull and your
jaw, and helps the jaw to slide properly. This disc can move out of position, causing
a clicking jaw or pain.



Arthritis of the joint, where the smooth cartilage that should protect the joint breaks
down.



Temporomandibular joint syndrome gets its name from the bones at either side of your
skull (the temporal bones) and your jawbone (the mandible). The joint between your
skull and your jaw is called the temporomandibular joint.

What are the symptoms?
The main symptoms of temporomandibular joint syndrome are:


Pain in the jaw joint, or in your face


Noise, like clicking or popping, from your jaw


Not being able to move your jaw easily, or finding that your jaw locks.


Some people with temporomandibular joint syndrome also get headaches, backache, or
neck pain, and some people feel depressed or anxious.

Most people won’t need any tests to diagnose their jaw problems, but doctors sometimes
order an X-ray if they want to examine the structure of the joint.

What treatments work?
A clicking or painful jaw can be very annoying. You might be reassured to know that
the problem rarely gets worse. It may even go away on its own given time. There are
also several treatments that can help you adapt to the problem with your jaw and reduce
the pain you get.

First-line treatments
Resting your jaw might help. This will allow the muscles you use for chewing to relax. You should
avoid chewing gum or biting your nails. Eating softer food for a while may also help
you rest your jaw.

You should also try to avoid stressful situations, as stress may lead you to clench
your jaw or grind your teeth, which can make your jaw problems worse. If you are very
stressed or anxious, a talking treatment like cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) might be useful.

Your doctor might recommend that you have physiotherapy. A physiotherapist will show you exercises designed to help your jaw. These might
involve opening and closing your mouth in a particular way: for example, trying to
keep your jaw movement in a straight line, and keeping your tongue touching the roof
of your mouth.

Doctors sometimes recommend a splint or guard to wear, usually at night (these look a bit like a boxer’s gumshield). If you clench
your jaw or grind your teeth, a splint or guard can help you stop, which may reduce
the pain in your jaw. You’ll need to see a dentist to get a guard fitted.

Some people try acupuncture for a painful or clicking jaw, but there’s no good evidence that it works.

Drug treatments
If resting your jaw doesn’t improve your pain in a couple of weeks, your doctor may
suggest drug treatment to help. The treatment you need will depend on what’s causing
the pain.

If you have pain because of a misaligned disc or arthritis, your doctor might recommend
an anti-inflammatory painkiller like ibuprofen.

If you’re getting pain in the muscles in your face, your doctor may recommend a drug
that relaxes your muscles, such as diazepam. You’ll probably take it for around 10 days. Diazepam can make you drowsy, and if
you take it for too long you can become dependent on it. This means you get withdrawal
symptoms when you stop taking it.

Surgery
Surgery is an option for people with temporomandibular joint syndrome, although it’s
usually a last resort. You might want to think about surgery if you get pain that
doesn’t go away with other treatments, or if the clicking in your jaw makes it hard
to chew, talk, or get on with your life. Surgical procedures include:



washing out the joint with sterile fluid to encourage the disc to move back to the
correct position (this is called arthrocentesis)



realigning the joint (this is called condylotomy or osteotomy)


replacing the joint itself with an artificial joint (called a total TMJ replacement).




Surgery isn’t always successful. If you’re considering it, make sure you talk to your
surgeon and get a realistic idea of what the outcome is likely to be. You’re likely
to get some pain and difficulty moving your jaw while you’re recovering from surgery.


What will happen to me?
Problems with a clicking or painful jaw tend to improve as you get older. People often
adapt to the way their jaw moves, and the joint itself may adapt over time. Most people
find their symptoms improve even without treatment.

Although there are treatments for a clicking or painful jaw, most aim to help with
the symptoms rather than cure the condition. For most people, it’s a case of learning
to live with a clicking jaw."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/3000269/Systemic%20lupus%20erythematosus,Systemic lupus erythematosus,"Systemic lupus erythematosus Last published: May 17, 2022
Systemic lupus erythematosus (usually just called lupus) is a long-term condition
that can affect many parts of the body. Most commonly, it causes joint pain, skin
rashes, and fatigue (tiredness).

There is no cure for lupus, but treatments can help to relieve the symptoms.
Complications from lupus can sometimes lead to early death. But better treatments
are making this much less common than it used to be. You can use our information to
talk to your doctor about the best treatments for you.

What is systemic lupus erythematosus?
Systemic lupus erythematosus (usually just called lupus or SLE) is what’s called an autoimmune condition.

This means that the body’s immune system, which usually helps protect us against infections,
starts to attack some of the body’s tissues.

If you have lupus, your immune system can cause inflammation (swelling) in some of
your tissues and organs, including:



the heart


the lungs


the kidneys, and


the brain.


Without treatment, this swelling can cause serious problems. Even with treatment,
some people with lupus will die early because of the condition.

This is because lupus and some of its treatments can lead to problems such as heart
disease and kidney disease.

Who gets lupus?
People of any age or sex can get lupus. But it’s most commonly diagnosed in women of childbearing age. This means the time between starting puberty and the menopause.

Lupus is also more common in people with African or Hispanic ancestry rather than white Northern European ancestry, and in people who smoke.

Lupus can be caused by several things, including:


your genes. About 40 in 100 people who have a parent with lupus will get also develop it



an infection. Some infections seem to make your immune system over-react, which can cause lupus



some medicines. Drugs that can sometimes cause lupus include some antibiotics, antifungals, and
drugs for treating arthritis and seizures.



What are the symptoms?
Lupus can have many symptoms, because it can affect many parts of the body, including
the skin, the nervous system, the digestive system, and the joints. The most common
symptoms can include:



skin rashes. These are often on the face, and can sometimes be caused by sun exposure


fatigue


weight loss


fever


mouth ulcers


hair loss


joint pain


Raynaud’s phenomenon, which causes colour changes, numbness, and pain in the fingers
and toes in cold weather, and



stomach problems, including pain, vomiting, or diarrhoea.


If your doctor thinks that you might have lupus, they will probably want to do some
tests. These will probably include blood and urine tests, and possibly an x-ray or other type of scan.

These tests might not be able to tell for sure if you have lupus. But they can often
find or rule out other things that might be causing your symptoms.

What treatments are available?
The aims of treatments for lupus are to:


improve your quality of life as much as possible


keep you as healthy as possible, to reduce your chance of dying early. Most people
with lupus don’t die because of it



prevent damage to your organs and body tissues, and


reduce the chance of side effects from treatments.


Learning about lupus
One of the most important things you can do is to learn as much as you can about lupus.
This helps you to play a major part in managing your condition and your treatments.

Your doctor should be able to direct you to good information about lupus. Lupus is
complex and there’s a lot to learn. But you can take it in at your own pace.

Non-drug treatments
Drug treatments are important for people with lupus. But there are several important
things that you can do for yourself that don’t involve medicines.

Sun protection
Sun exposure can make lupus worse. In sunny weather, people with lupus should:


stay out of the sun as much as possible


wear protective clothing, such as long-sleeved tops, long trousers or skirts, and
hats, and



use good-quality sunscreen.


Diet
There is no special diet recommended for people with lupus. But there are a few things
to bear in mind. For example, people with lupus are advised to:



eat a generally healthy diet including plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables


avoid too much salt if you have high blood pressure


try to keep to a healthy weight


take vitamin D supplements. This is because people with lupus are advised to stay
out of the sun (sunlight is how we usually get most of our vitamin D). Your doctor
can advise you about vitamin D supplements, and



avoid herbal remedies. These can interact with medicines, which can cause harm.


Exercise
It’s hard to think about exercise when you feel tired much of the time. But it’s important
to do what you can, in order to stay as healthy as possible, both physically and mentally.

You can talk to your doctor about what you feel capable of doing. Most people find
it much easier to exercise when doing something they enjoy. But you should always
stop exercising if you feel uncomfortable or in pain.

Mental health
It’s not surprising that some people with lupus find that it can make them feel low.
Of course, support from family, friends, and online communities can make a huge difference.
But many people find that talking treatments help with feelings of depression, as well as with fatigue and even pain.

Your doctor might be able to help you access help such as cognitive behaviour therapy
(CBT) and psychotherapy, if you feel that they might help.

Smoking
Smoking seems to make lupus worse. It also interferes with how some of the drug treatments
work. So it’s a good idea to stop smoking if you have lupus. Your doctor is a good
place to start if you need help to stop.

Medicines for lupus
Several types of drug are useful for treating lupus. For example, some drugs treat
the symptoms, such as pain and rashes, while others help to calm down the immune system
to stop it attacking your joints and organs.

Medicines for pain and inflammation
The main drugs used to treat joint pain and swelling are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs for short). You might have heard of some of these, such as ibuprofen and naproxen.

These drugs can cause stomach problems. So if you need to take them for a long time
your doctor should prescribe something to protect your stomach.

At times, some people need stronger anti-inflammatory drugs called corticosteroids (usually just called steroids). These drugs can be very helpful, but when used for
long periods they cause serious side effects. These can include:



diabetes


thinning of the skin


weakened bones, and


mood changes.


So your doctor will want to prescribe steroids at the lowest possible dose for the
shortest possible time. They should also discuss the possible side effects with you.

Medicines for calming the immune system
Some drugs help to calm the immune system so that it can’t attack the body. These
are called immunosuppressants.

But of course the immune system is vital in keeping us healthy. So doctors usually
only recommend these drugs for people with severe lupus, or when other treatments
haven’t worked.

If your doctor suggests that you need this type of medicine, they should talk to you
about extra things you might need to do to stay healthy while taking them.

Biological medicines
Biological drugs are fairly new. They are based on the body’s own tissues, so that
they should act in a more natural way.

The biological drugs used to treat lupus target specific parts of the immune system
that cause lupus symptoms.

Like immunosuppressants, these drugs tend to be used in people who don’t do well with
other treatments.

Treatments to help with symptoms
Many of the drug treatments mentioned above are aimed at controlling lupus. But there
are treatments that help with individual symptoms.

Some of the drugs mentioned above help with this, too. For example, NSAIDs and steroids
can help with joint pain and stiffness.

Treatments for other symptoms include:


mouthwashes and creams to help with mouth ulcers


artificial saliva for a dry mouth


eye drops for dry eyes, and



creams to treat rashes.



You can talk to your doctor about these and any other symptoms you might have. They
might be able to prescribe something that will help.

What to expect in the future
Lupus can cause serious complications, such as heart problems. And some of the treatments
that help can also cause problems. So your doctor will want to monitor you and your
treatment regularly.

For example, you might need to have regular blood tests, and have checks for any side effects of treatments.

While it’s true that some people die from complications of lupus, good treatments
have made this far less common than it used to be. Most people with lupus live largely
normal lives.

More than 90 in 100 people with lupus are still alive 10 years after they are diagnosed.
Note: this doesn’t mean that people aren’t expected to live longer than 10 years with
lupus: it’s just that it’s hard to do follow-up studies for longer than 10 years.

Lupus and pregnancy
Having lupus while pregnant makes miscarriage more likely, but you can still become
pregnant and have children if you have lupus. About two-thirds of women with lupus
have a normal pregnancy.

Even so, if you have lupus and become pregnant, you should be managed by a specialist
obstetric (pregnancy) team.

If you become pregnant or are planning to, you can talk to your doctor about:


what special treatment and monitoring you will have during your pregnancy


what you need to know about lupus and pregnancy, and


what lupus medicines are safe to take while pregnant."

Syphilis is an infection that can be passed from person to person during sex. Antibiotics
work well to cure the infection. But, if it's left untreated, syphilis can spread
to other parts of your body and cause serious health problems.

This leaflet gives an overview of the syphilis infection, including its symptoms and
stages. To learn more about tests and treatments for syphilis, see our leaflet Syphilis: how is it diagnosed and treated?.

What is syphilis?
Syphilis is an infection caused by a type of bacteria called Treponema pallidum. The bacteria pass from person to person during sex, including anal, oral, and vaginal
sex.

You may hear syphilis referred to as a sexually transmitted disease (STD) or sexually
transmitted infection (STI).

Syphilis is very common worldwide, with more than 10 million people becoming infected
each year.

Many people pass the infection to others without realising they have it. This is because
syphilis may not cause any noticeable symptoms early on, when it is most likely to
be spread.

A pregnant woman with syphilis can pass the infection to her unborn baby.
What are the symptoms?
Syphilis causes different symptoms depending on how advanced it is (its stage) and
where it has spread in the body.

Primary stage
Within weeks of being infected, you may notice a sore (called a chancre) in the area
where the bacteria entered your body: for example, on your genitals, rectum, or mouth.

The sore can also develop inside your body: for example, on your cervix if you’re
a woman (the cervix is the opening to the womb). The sore is almost always painless.

The sore can develop up to 90 days after a person is infected, but most people get
it within 14 to 21 days.

It usually goes away within three to six weeks, and some people never notice they
have it. Some people get more than one sore.

The sores of primary syphilis contain the syphilis bacteria. Direct contact with these
sores during sex is how many people become infected.

Secondary stage
If primary syphilis is not treated, you may develop symptoms of secondary syphilis
around four to eight weeks after getting the sore. The symptoms can include:



fever


tiredness


feeling generally unwell


muscle or joint pain


a rash on your hands, feet, torso, or scalp


sores in your mouth or on your genitals


a wart-like growth on your genitals


patches of hair loss on your head.


These symptoms will go away in time, although some of them might come back. You can
get syphilis if you have direct contact with the sores of secondary syphilis.

Latent stage
After the symptoms of primary and secondary syphilis disappear, you have what's called
latent syphilis. ‘Latent’ means ‘hidden’. During this stage you still have syphilis
but it is not causing any signs or symptoms.

You can have latent syphilis for years. You are unlikely to pass on the infection
during this stage, but it’s still important to practise safe sex by using condoms.

Late stage
Not everyone with untreated syphilis goes on to get late syphilis (also called tertiary
syphilis). But for those who do, it can cause very serious health problems.

In late syphilis, the infection has spread to other parts of your body and is causing
damage. This can cause different symptoms, depending on where the infection has spread.
For example:

If syphilis has spread to your brain or spinal cord, symptoms can include:


headaches


seizures


memory problems


difficulty controlling your muscles (ataxia)


problems with your eyesight or hearing, and


difficulty controlling your bowels or bladder.


If syphilis has spread to your heart, symptoms can include:


chest pain (angina)


shortness of breath


fatigue, and


a rapid heartbeat.


Syphilis can also damage your liver, blood vessels, nerves, bones, and joints.
Although these problems usually happen only if you’ve had syphilis for a long time,
problems in your brain or spinal cord (called neurosyphilis) can happen at any stage
of the infection.

Treatment with antibiotics can cure syphilis at any stage. But any damage already
done to your body may be permanent. This is why it’s so important to be diagnosed
and treated early.

Syphilis is an infection caused by a bacteria. It can be passed from person to person

she can also pass the infection to her unborn baby.

Antibiotics work well to cure the infection. But, if left untreated, syphilis can
spread to other parts of your body and cause damage, leading to serious health problems.


In this leaflet, we look at how syphilis is diagnosed and treated. To learn more about
the syphilis infection, its stages, and its symptoms, see the leaflet Syphilis: what is it?

How is syphilis diagnosed?
If you think you might have syphilis, you should see your doctor or go to your local
sexual health clinic.

A doctor or nurse will examine you and ask questions about any symptoms you have,
as well as about your sexual partners and history.

The most common symptom of syphilis is a sore (called a chancre) that forms in the
area where the bacteria entered your body: for example, on your genitals, rectum,
or mouth. The sore is almost always painless.

To find out if you have syphilis, you will have one or more of the following tests.




Blood tests. Most people are diagnosed with syphilis through blood tests. These tests look for
signs of the infection in the blood.

Some tests also show how active the infection is, which can be helpful in checking
how well treatment is working.

Blood tests can only detect syphilis once you’ve had the infection for at least three
or four weeks. So you may need to have repeated tests.



Test of the fluid from a sore. If you have a sore that might be caused by syphilis, your doctor may take a small
sample of fluid and cells from the sore. This sample will then be checked under a
microscope to look for the bacteria that cause syphilis.

However, this test isn’t always available, and some people with syphilis won’t have
a sore.



Test of the fluid surrounding your brain and spinal cord. If your doctor thinks you could have syphilis in your brain or spinal cord (called
neurosyphilis), you may have a lumbar puncture. This involves collecting a small sample
of fluid from your spinal cord using a needle. The fluid is then tested for signs
of the infection.



If you are diagnosed with syphilis, it’s important that you tell your sexual partner
or partners so that they can also be tested. If you feel uncomfortable doing this,
your sexual health clinic may be able to contact them for you.

In some areas, public health workers are required to contact all of the sexual partners
of someone with syphilis.

Screening for syphilis
Many people with syphilis don’t know they have the infection, as they may not have
any symptoms. As a result, doctors often recommend that people be tested for syphilis
if they have a greater chance than usual of becoming infected. This is called screening.

Pregnant women and people donating blood are also routinely screened for syphilis.
To learn more, see the leaflet Syphilis screening.

What treatments work?
Treating the infection
Antibiotics are the main treatment for syphilis. These are drugs that kill bacteria. They should
get rid of your infection, regardless of what stage it is or where it has spread.

But treatment can’t undo any damage already caused by syphilis. This is why it’s so
important to be diagnosed and treated early.

It’s also important that you not have any kind of sexual contact with another person
until blood tests show that your infection has been cured.

The main antibiotic used for syphilis is penicillin. It is usually given as an injection. You may need only one dose. But if your syphilis
is at a later stage, you may need more doses.

And if the infection has spread to your brain or spinal cord (neurosyphilis), you
will need intensive treatment in hospital. Usually this involves having antibiotics
through a drip (an intravenous infusion, or IV for short) for 10 to 14 days.

Penicillin is the most effective antibiotic for syphilis, but some people are allergic
to it. These people can be given an antibiotic called doxycycline. You take doxycycline as a tablet for 14 or 28 days, depending on the stage of your
syphilis.

Doxycycline doesn't seem to work well for neurosyphilis. So people with a penicillin
allergy are usually still treated with penicillin. But first they have ‘penicillin
desensitisation’.

This means you are given a series of small doses of penicillin in hospital, usually
over four hours. Afterwards, you should be able to have penicillin treatment safely.


If a pregnant woman has syphilis, treatment with penicillin can cure the infection
both in the woman and in her unborn baby. This can reduce the chance of miscarriage,
the baby being stillborn, or problems from the infection after the birth.

Doxycycline is not used in pregnancy, as it can harm the baby.
Penicillin is also the recommended treatment for babies born with syphilis.
Some people get a fever, headache, and muscle pain within 24 hours of starting an
antibiotic for syphilis. This is called the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. The symptoms of the reaction usually improve within a few hours.

Drinking lots of water and taking paracetamol can help you feel better. Doctors also
sometimes prescribe medicine to help prevent the reaction.

Treating damage caused by late syphilis
In late syphilis, the infection has spread to other parts of your body and is causing
damage. This can result in different problems, depending on where the infection has
spread. For example:



If syphilis has spread to your brain or spinal cord, you may get headaches, seizures, problems with your memory, difficulty controlling
your muscles (ataxia), problems with your eyesight or hearing, and difficulty controlling
your bowels or bladder, among other problems.



If syphilis has spread to your heart, you may get chest pain (angina), shortness of breath, fatigue, and a rapid heartbeat,
among other problems.



Syphilis can also damage your liver, blood vessels, nerves, bones, and joints.

If you have late syphilis, antibiotics will cure your infection. But you may need
other treatments to help with the damage syphilis has caused.

For example, if syphilis has damaged your heart, you may have heart failure. This
means your heart is no longer able to pump blood around your body as well as it should.
There is no cure for heart failure, but treatment can improve your symptoms and help
slow further damage.

You will probably see a specialist doctor to treat any damage caused by syphilis.
For example, this might be a cardiologist if syphilis has damaged your heart or a
neurologist if syphilis has damaged your brain or spinal cord.

What will happen to me?
Syphilis is a treatable illness. Antibiotics can cure the infection, and most people
make a full recovery. However, if syphilis isn’t treated early on, it can cause serious
damage to your body and even be fatal.

Early diagnosis and treatment of syphilis are key to making a good recovery and preventing
the spread of the infection to others.

If you’ve had syphilis, you can be re-infected if you come into contact with the bacteria
again. Making sure your sexual partners are tested (and treated if necessary) can
help prevent this.

Practising safe sex by using condoms reduces your chances of getting syphilis again.
But you can still get the infection if you have oral sex with an infected person.

If you’re at all concerned that you’ve been re-infected with syphilis, it’s important
to get tested."

Syphilis is an infection that can be passed from person to person during sex. Antibiotics
work well to cure the infection. But syphilis that's left untreated can cause severe
health problems.

Many people with syphilis don’t know they have the infection, as they may not have
any symptoms. As a result, doctors often recommend that people be tested for syphilis
if they have an increased chance of being infected. This is called screening.

People offered screening may include:


people who have more than one sex partner


people who have another sexually transmitted infection (STI), such as herpes, gonorrhoea,
chlamydia, or HIV. People with HIV have an especially high chance of being infected
with syphilis



men who have sex with men


people who use recreational ('street') drugs


sex workers.


In some countries, anyone visiting a sexual health clinic will be tested for syphilis.
And in many countries all pregnant women are tested at their first pregnancy appointment,
and sometimes later in their pregnancy as well.

If a pregnant woman tests positive for syphilis, treatment can cure the infection
both in the woman and in her unborn baby. This can reduce the chance of problems from
the infection after the baby is born, and of the baby being miscarried or stillborn.

You will also be tested for syphilis when you donate blood. This is because the infection
can be passed on through blood transfusions and other treatments that use donated
blood.

Screening for syphilis is done through a blood test. A sample of blood will be taken
from your arm. This blood will then be tested for signs of the infection. If this
test suggests that you have syphilis, you will have further tests to confirm whether
you have the infection.

https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/3000147/Suicide%20risk%20management,Suicide risk management,"Suicide risk management Last published: Sep 27, 2021
Many people have good treatment for depression and other mental-health issues. But
some people with these problems try to kill themselves, and some succeed. If you feel
suicidal, or if you think someone close to you feels this way, there are people who
can help, including your doctor.

What is suicide risk management?
If you seek treatment for a mental health issue and are feeling low, your doctor will
want to try to understand whether you feel so bad that you might think about killing
yourself.

If your doctor thinks that this is the case, he or she will want to take steps to
keep you as safe as possible. This is suicide risk management.

Suicide risk management should have both short- and long-term elements. So, while
it is about keeping you safe right now, in the short-term, it should also be part
of longer-term help.

The two things that most commonly lead people to try to kill themselves are:


bouts of severe depression, and


issues with substance abuse (abusing alcohol, street drugs, or medications). Substance
abuse is a complex issue and can cause problems in lots of ways. For example, drug
abuse can lead to mental-health problems.

But it’s more likely that mental-health problems led to the drug abuse in the first
place - and then the drug use makes things worse.



Many other things can lead to someone trying to kill themselves, including:


struggling to cope with mental-health conditions other than depression, such as anorexia,
bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia



losing a loved one


being in prison


divorce or the breakdown of a relationship


social problems, such as those around unemployment and housing


money problems, and


a combination of events that make like feel unbearable.


As well as mental-health issues, some physical illnesses are linked to a greater chance
of suicide attempts. These include:



epilepsy


Huntington’s disease


HIV


stroke


some types of cancer, and


some physical disabilities.


Physical illnesses can cause people to think about suicide for many reasons. For example,
it might be that someone is in a lot of pain or feels hopeless. Or maybe someone with
a terminal illness wishes to die on his or her own terms.

Assessing suicide risk
When assessing whether someone is at risk of suicide, doctors look at what are called
'risk factors'. These are things that make something more likely to happen.

The main risk factors that make someone think about suicide are:


serious mental-health issues


having tried suicide in the past


having self-harmed in the past, and


having a family history of suicide.


But it’s still possible to feel suicidal without having any of these risk factors.
And suicide risk management is not about ticking boxes or treating people as risks.


So, regardless of how many of these risk factors might apply to you, the most important
ways for your doctor to understand your mental state are simply talking to you, and
listening to what you have to say about how you feel.

Suicide risk management shouldn’t just happen once at the start of your treatment.
It should be ongoing, and it should be assessed again if certain things happen, such
as if:



you need emergency treatment


there are any major changes planned in your treatment: for example, if you change
doctors or change where you are treated



your symptoms suddenly get worse or better, or if your diagnosis changes for any reason




something in your life happens that upsets you badly


you suddenly decide to stop having treatment for a mental-health problem.


While suicide risk management is an ongoing part of treatment, there are times when
a doctor might need to take immediate action to protect someone. These are when someone
is:



threatening to hurt or kill himself or herself


looking for ways to kill himself or herself


seeking access to pills, weapons, or other means of suicide, or


talking or writing about death, dying, or suicide.


During any assessment of suicide risk your doctor will ask you questions about how
you are feeling.

Some of these questions might sound a bit simple and obvious. But they will help your
doctor to understand your feelings. He or she might ask questions like:



have you thought that your life is not worth living?


have you thought about ending your life?


do you feel that your reasons for living outweigh your reasons for dying?


if you had a way, would you try to take your own life?


how often do you think about dying?


how do you feel when you start thinking about taking your own life?


have you ever thought of ways to take your own life?


have you ever made plans to end your own life?


do you have access to a way of ending your life, such as pills, poison, or a weapon?




have you taken steps to prepare to take your own life, such as writing a suicide note
or a will, or giving away your possessions?



do you think that you could take your own life?


do you feel ready to die?


If you are having an assessment or emergency treatment with a doctor who has not treated
you before, he or she will also ask you questions about your medical history, including
your mental-health history.

The doctor will also probably ask you about:


how you are feeling at the moment


your home life


how well you are coping and managing with your life in general


things that are happening in your life that overwhelm or stress you, and


good things in your life - things that are stopping you from attempting suicide.


What help is there?
If it becomes clear during an assessment that there is a chance you might attempt
suicide, your doctor should offer you help.

This help should be based on whether your doctor feels, after talking with you, that
you are at immediate risk of attempting suicide. The doctor’s decision will depend
on several things, including:



how likely your doctor thinks you are to try to kill yourself


whether you have a mental-health problem that makes you more likely to try to kill
yourself, and



how much support you have in your life: for example, from health services, and from
family and friends.



Urgent help
If your doctor thinks that you are very likely to attempt suicide in the near future,
he or she might suggest that you be admitted to hospital for treatment. Your doctor
might also suggest hospital admission if you:



have psychosis (you see or hear things that aren’t there)


need urgent round-the-clock treatment for a mental-health problem, or


don’t have enough social support outside hospital. For example, you might live alone
with no friends or family nearby, which might make you feel lonely and desperate.



Some people also need urgent detoxification treatment ('detox') in hospital for substance
use.

And some people have to be admitted to hospital and given treatment against their
wishes. The rules around this are different depending on where you live. But in many
countries they will be similar to those in the UK, where this should be done only:




as a last resort


when someone needs urgent hospital treatment, and


usually only if they are judged to be a danger to themselves or others.


In the UK you might hear this called being 'sectioned', as it refers to some sections
of a law called the Mental Health Act.

Under this law you have rights. Your doctor can’t just decide to have you sectioned.
It needs two doctors and a mental-health professional to agree that it needs to happen.


If you don’t agree that you should have been sectioned you can appeal against the
decision. And you have the right to complain about your treatment.

Longer-term help
Longer-term treatments for people at risk of suicide are similar to some treatments
for other mental-health problems.

These treatments include various types of psychotherapy (talking treatments) and medications.
For many people, suicidal thoughts are a result of long-term mental-health conditions:
for example, schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. So the best way to treat these suicidal
thoughts is to treat those conditions.

Medications
The medications you are offered will depend on what mental-health conditions affect
you. For example, different medications are used to treat conditions such as bipolar
disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and depression.

These medications can cause side effects. Your doctor should discuss these in detail
with you.

If the side effects of your medications bother you, tell your doctor. You might be
able to change to a different one, or to change to a lower dose.

Certain medications are not safe to take during pregnancy. One in particular, called
sodium valproate, causes serious birth defects in babies.

If you are pregnant, tell your doctor. And if you are a woman and your doctor suggests
that you take sodium valproate, your doctor will need to make a plan with you to make
sure that you don’t get pregnant.

Psychotherapy
Research shows that psychotherapy reduces suicides in people with mental-health problems.
Different types of psychotherapy seem to help with different mental-health conditions.

One type that works well with a variety of mental-health issues is cognitive behaviour
therapy (CBT). This therapy helps you to cope with negative thoughts and to break
down problems and deal them one step at a time.

What will happen?
If your doctor thinks that you might try to kill yourself, he or she should take some
simple steps, even if you don’t need urgent treatment.



Your doctor should make sure that you go home with someone close to you who can support
you in the short term.



You should be given a contact card with the name and phone number of a crisis worker,
in case your situation gets worse.



The person supporting you at home should be given a similar card.


You and your supporting person should be advised to make your home as free as possible
of things that could aid suicide. This means, for example, that pills should be locked
up, and guns and possible poisons should be removed from your home.



Your doctor will want to follow up with you regularly. And, if you are not having
any treatment already, your doctor will probably suggest some - possibly some form
of psychotherapy, medication, or both.

Your doctor might also help you to find useful online resources for people having
suicidal thoughts, such as the Staying Safe website (stayingsafe.net).

It’s not possible to say what will happen to an individual who is at risk of suicide
for any reason. But the sad truth is that some people kill themselves, even if they
are having the best available treatment.

Many people make multiple suicide attempts over a number of years. And the more times
a person tries to kill himself or herself, the more likely he or she is to succeed
in the end.

But treatment and support help many people. And most people who attempt suicide -
even those who try several times - do not die in this way."

Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is when a baby dies suddenly while sleeping, and
doctors can't find a cause. It is also called cot death. Sudden infant death syndrome
is not common and it's rare in babies more than six months old. But there are some
simple things you can do to make it even less likely.

What is sudden infant death syndrome?
Sudden infant death syndrome happens without any warning when the baby is thought
to be sleeping. It can happen when the baby is in a cot, but babies can also die when
they're sleeping somewhere else, such as in a pram or in their parent's arms.

Babies who die of sudden infant death syndrome usually do so peacefully in their sleep
and show no signs of pain or distress. There aren't any symptoms or warning signs.
It's natural for parents to feel heartbroken if their child dies but it's important
that parents do not blame themselves. In most cases of sudden infant death doctors
never find the cause.

What helps reduce the chance of sudden infant death syndrome?
There are several things you can do to reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome.
Smoking
The most important thing you can do is not to smoke around your baby. Research has
found that up to 25 in 100 cot deaths may be caused by babies being around tobacco
smoke.

Don't smoke when you're pregnant. Sudden infant death is more common in babies whose
mothers smoked when they were pregnant.

Being around people who smoke increases a baby's chance of dying. So keep your baby
away from smoky places. If you can't give up smoking make sure that no one smokes
in the same room as your baby.

Cot deaths have been reduced after national campaigns advising parents to avoid smoking
around their baby.

If you want help to stop smoking, either before or after having a baby, talk to your
doctor.

Sleeping
Lay your baby down to sleep on his or her back, not on their front. Try not to put your baby on their side, as this makes it easier for
them to roll onto their front.

The number of sudden infant deaths has fallen in countries where parents are advised
to lay their babies on their backs to sleep.

Several other things seem to reduce the chance of cot death:


Don't sleep in the same bed as your baby. Bed sharing increases the chance of sudden
infant death. But do keep your baby's cot in your room for the first six months.



Make sure your baby's vaccinations are up to date. Vaccinations offer protection against
diseases that can cause cot death.



Don't put pillows, soft toys, or comforters in the cot. The mattress should be firm
with tight-fitting sheets.



It's fine to let your baby sleep with a dummy. Researchers aren't sure why, but babies
who sleep with dummies are less likely to die.



Breastfeeding seems to make cot death less likely.


Don't cover your baby's head in the cot.


Should I get a breathing monitor?
Some companies sell devices that monitor a baby's breathing. Doctors sometimes suggest
using these for babies who have a medical condition that affects their breathing.
And they're sometimes given to parents who've lost a baby to sudden infant death and
who go on to have another child.

But there's no evidence that home breathing monitors can reduce the risk of SIDS and
doctors don't usually recommend them.

Where can I get more help?
Parents who have lost a child to sudden infant death need a lot of emotional support.
It's completely natural to feel grief and many parents feel guilty or that they should
have done something differently.

Counselling, advice, and practical help are available. Many parents find it helps
to talk to other people who've been in the same situation. Your doctor may be able
to put you in touch with a support group in your area."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/3000077/Subarachnoid%20haemorrhage,Subarachnoid haemorrhage,"Subarachnoid haemorrhage Last published: Aug 05, 2021
Subarachnoid haemorrhage is the medical name for a certain type of bleeding in your
head, in the space between your brain and your skull.

Subarachnoid haemorrhage is a medical emergency and can be fatal. But timely treatment
saves lives. So if you spot the signs in yourself or someone else, get help fast.

What is subarachnoid haemorrhage?
Subarachnoid haemorrhage is a rare type of stroke. It happens when there is bleeding
in the subarachnoid space - the area in between the inside of your skull and the surface of your brain.

The haemorrhage (bleeding) often happens when an aneurysm bursts. An aneurysm is a bulge in a blood vessel. It happens when a weak place in
the blood-vessel wall stretches and fills with blood.

It’s not really clear why aneurysms form in some people’s heads. But we do know that
some things make them more likely, including:



having close relatives with this type of problem


smoking


being older


having high blood pressure


being black


being a woman


drinking a lot of alcohol over many years


using cocaine, and


having certain medical conditions, including Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and polycystic
kidney disease.



This might look like a long list, but subarachnoid haemorrhage is not common. But
it is vital to act fast if you recognise the signs, as it’s often fatal when not treated
quickly.

What are the symptoms?
The main symptom of subarachnoid haemorrhage is a sudden, very severe headache. Many people describe it as the worst headache of their life. It is sometimes called
a ‘thunderclap’ headache.

Other symptoms include:



nausea


vomiting, and


extreme sensitivity to light (called photophobia), which can cause pain and discomfort
in the eyes.



If you or someone else has symptoms that suggest subarachnoid haemorrhage, call an
ambulance straight away.

People with suspected subarachnoid haemorrhage should receive emergency treatment
in hospital. Some people who have subarachnoid haemorrhage are awake and can answer
questions from the medical team. But some people arrive at hospital unconscious.

The doctor will want to do some tests, including a CT scan to check for bleeding in
the brain, and blood tests.

He or she might also want to do a test called a lumbar puncture. It involves taking
fluid from your spine with a needle, to be tested for blood. This helps to tell for
certain whether there is bleeding in your head.

What treatments are available?
The main treatment for subarachnoid haemorrhage is surgery to seal the aneurysm so that it can’t bleed any more.

But before that can happen the medical team will need to do some more tests and to
make you as stable and comfortable as they can before operating.

For example, you might need:


help to breathe properly, using a ventilator (a machine that helps you breathe when
your lungs are struggling)



medicine to ease pain while you are waiting for surgery


medicines to prevent seizures, which can happen after subarachnoid haemorrhage, and
which can cause more bleeding if not prevented



medicine to prevent coughing. Any jolting or jerking movement, such as coughing, could
cause more bleeding



medicine to soften your stools (poo). This is so you won’t need to strain when you
go to the toilet. Straining could cause more bleeding.



You might also need drugs to help your blood to flow properly. This can involve a
balance between two problems that can happen in people with subarachnoid haemorrhage.



If you have coagulopathy, this means that your blood doesn’t clot easily enough, so that it’s too ‘thin’,
and you bleed too easily, while



vasospasm means that your blood vessels constrict (tighten up and get too narrow) so that your
blood doesn’t flow freely enough around your body.



Surgery to repair the aneurysm
If you have surgery for subarachnoid haemorrhage it will usually be done within 72
hours (three days) of you being admitted to hospital.

There are two types of surgery that can repair a burst aneurysm in your head.


With surgical clipping a clip is placed across the neck of the aneurysm so that no more blood can enter
it. To do this, the surgeon needs to cut away a small piece of your skull. This is
called a craniotomy. Once the aneurysm is repaired the piece of skull is replaced and your scalp is stitched
up.



With coil embolisation (or just ‘coiling’) a thin tube called a catheter is inserted into an artery in your
groin or leg and up through your blood vessels to where the aneurysm is. Tiny coils
made of a metal called titanium are then passed along the coil and into the aneurysm.
These coils block up the aneurysm.



It’s not really clear whether one of these techniques is better than the other at
sealing up aneurysms and stopping them bleeding again.

Some research suggests that coiling works better at preventing bleeding from happening
again in the short term, but that in some people the operation needs to be repeated.

If you have coiling you also need to have check-ups from time to time to see if the
coils are still doing their job. With clipping, you don’t need check-ups.

Coiling might be a better option in people who are not well enough to have a craniotomy.
What will happen?
Treatments for subarachnoid haemorrhage have improved a lot in recent years, but the
condition is still fatal in many people.

And many people who survive have complications, which can be permanent. Heart and
lung problems are the most common long-term complications.

Younger people and those who are conscious (awake) after a haemorrhage tend to have
the best chance of a good recovery. Most people who are in a coma after a haemorrhage
will not survive.

Six months after treatment for subarachnoid haemorrhage, 75 in 100 people who were
conscious before treatment are still alive.

But up to half of those who survive will have some kind of disability. This can include
problems with:



memory and thinking clearly


depression


quality of life, and


emotional health.


After treatment, you might need to have a test called an angiography from time to
time. This test checks for any problems in your blood vessels.

This test is usually done every 6 to 12 months until your doctor decides it’s not
needed any more.

More help
Some charities and support groups offer help and information to people who have had
a subarachnoid haemorrhage and their loved ones.

For example, in the UK, the Stroke Association (stroke.org.uk) offers a wide range
of resources covering treatment, recovery, and local support.

Your treatment team might be able to help you find support where you live. Or you
could search online."

What is a stroke?
A stroke happens when the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off. If brain cells
go too long without a supply of blood they will die.

There are two main causes of a stroke. The most common is a blood clot. This is called
an ischaemic stroke. If a blood clot gets stuck in a blood vessel in the brain it can block the flow
of blood. This can damage the part of the brain that's no longer getting a supply
of blood.

A stroke can also be caused by bleeding in the brain. This is called a haemorrhagic stroke. If a blood vessel bursts in or near your brain the bleeding can cause damage and
lead to a stroke.

What are the symptoms?
Strokes usually happen quickly and without any warning. But the symptoms someone has
in the first few days after a stroke may not last forever.

Symptoms of a stroke include:


feeling weak or numb on one side of the body and possibly being unable to move that
side of the body at all



dizziness


difficulty walking


drooping of one side of the face


difficulty speaking. This can be caused by problems with the muscles in the face,
or by difficulty finding words and using language (called dysphasia), or both



problems understanding what people are saying


trouble seeing out of one or both eyes


passing out


severe headache


difficulty swallowing.


Someone who is having a stroke might have several or most of these symptoms.
A stroke is an emergency. It's very important to get medical attention straight away.
However, the ambulance or paramedics may not take you to the nearest hospital. That's
because people do better at hospitals with specialist stroke units. It might be better
to go farther away to a hospital that can provide specialist care.

What treatments work?
If you've had a stroke you'll need emergency treatment in hospital. The main aims
of treatment are to:



restore blood flow to the affected area


prevent complications caused by strokes.


At hospital you might be given fluid through a tube. Some people need a tube that's
put into their mouth to help them breathe.

Someone who's had a stroke will need several scans and tests. These tests can tell
doctors what type of stroke someone has had. The treatments for a stroke depend on
whether it was caused by a blood clot or by bleeding.

Treatments for a stroke caused by a blood clot (ischaemic stroke)
Most strokes are caused by a blood clot that blocks a blood vessel. So you'll probably
be given drugs that break down the clot. This type of treatment is called thrombolysis.

You might be given a drug called alteplase. This helps break down blood clots. But it's only useful if it's given within the
first few hours after the stroke.

People treated with alteplase have a better chance of complete recovery, even taking
into account the chance of serious side effects. In particular, alteplase can cause
bleeding in the brain (brain haemorrhage) in some people.

Aspirin is well-known as a painkiller. But it is also given to most people who have just
had a stroke. It is used to stop blood from clotting in the usual way. Being given
aspirin within 48 hours of having a stroke reduces your chance of dying or of being
severely disabled.

Like alteplase, aspirin can cause unwanted bleeding, including a brain haemorrhage.
But if you've had a stroke the benefits of aspirin outweigh the risk of side effects.

Some people need treatments that target their blood clot more directly. This could
mean having thrombolysis drugs injected into the blood vessel very near to the clot.
This is called intra-arterial thrombolysis.

People who have a blockage of a large blood vessel in the brain can sometimes have
the blood clot physically removed. To do this, a surgeon uses an instrument called
a stent remover.

Treatment for a stroke caused by bleeding (haemorrhagic stroke)
Strokes caused by bleeding into the brain, rather than by blood clots, often need
surgery. This is to repair the broken blood vessel and remove the extra blood that's
pooled in the brain.

Not everyone who has this type of stroke needs surgery. Whether you need surgery depends
partly on how much bleeding there has been. The more bleeding there is in the brain,
the more likely you are to need an operation.

What will happen?
It's hard to say what will happen after a stroke. More than half of people go on to
make a good recovery and are able to take care of themselves.

But recovery can take time. About two thirds of people who have a stroke will have
some kind of disability when they leave hospital. Some of these disabilties will be
long lasting.

About 15 in 100 people who have a stroke will die within 30 days of it. These first
30 days are the most dangerous time for people who have a stroke. After that the outlook
is much better. But about 25 in 100 people will have a second stroke within 5 years.

The outlook is better for younger people, men, and people who don't have other health
problems.

It's hard to say how someone's symptoms will change in the weeks and months after
a stroke. But there's a lot to be hopeful about. Research shows that being treated
by specialists in a stroke team, such as a physiotherapist or a speech therapist,
can help reduce disability after a stroke.

Doctors often recommend treatment to reduce the chance of a second stroke. To find
out more, see our information on Preventing another stroke.

Caring for someone who's had a stroke
Caring for someone who has had a stroke can be physically and emotionally demanding.
Carers might have to help with dressing, feeding, and washing. They might have to
change their own lifestyle to be able to do all these things.

Carers often say that they sometimes feel isolated and often don't get enough rest
or sleep. To avoid becoming ill themselves it's important for carers to realise that
they might not be able to do everything themselves.

They might need extra help at home. Or they might need to arrange for someone else
to take over the care for a time so that they can have a break.

Support groups can help carers feel less isolated. Your doctor can give you advice
and put you in touch with organisations that provide help and support.

For example, in the UK the Stroke Association is a charity that offers information
and support to people who've had a stroke and their families. You can find out more
at their website (stroke.org.uk)."

If you are a woman with stress incontinence, regularly doing pelvic floor exercises
is likely to improve your symptoms. Studies suggest that many women stay dry or leak
less after doing these exercises for three months.

Here is an overview of how to do these exercises.
Find the right muscles
There are a few ways to identify your pelvic floor muscles.


Try to stop the flow of urine when you're sitting on the toilet. If you can do this,
you've found the right muscles to exercise.



Imagine you're trying to stop passing wind, and squeeze these muscles. If you have
a 'pulling' feeling, then you're squeezing the right muscles.



Lie down and put your finger in your vagina and squeeze as if you're trying to stop
urine from coming out. If you feel tightness on your finger, then you've found the
right muscles.



If you're not sure, ask your doctor, nurse, or physiotherapist to help you find these
muscles. Many women squeeze the wrong muscles at first. Some other tips:



Be careful not to squeeze other muscles at the same time, such as muscles in your
thighs, back, and stomach. Squeeze only the muscles of your pelvic floor, and don't
hold your breath! Breathe slowly and deeply.



Draw your muscles up and in. Try not to strain down. Rest a hand lightly on your stomach.
If you feel your stomach pushing out against your hand, then you're straining down.
If you find that you always push down, check with your doctor, nurse, or physiotherapist
to learn how to do the exercises properly.



Get the most benefit from your exercises


Pull in the muscles of your pelvic floor as much as possible to the count of five,
and then relax to the count of five. Repeat this 10 times, three times a day.



Pull in your pelvic floor muscles as much as possible and then quickly relax them.
Repeat this 10 times, five times a day.



You can do these exercises anywhere and any time, but they usually don't work as well
if you do them when you’re focusing on something else (for example, when you’re watching
television). You need to concentrate, especially at first.



Get into a routine of doing the exercises. For example, you may like to do them before
you get up in the morning and before you go to sleep.



Be patient
You may start to feel some benefit from these exercises after one week. You should
do the exercises for at least three months, and continue them if they help.

If you do these exercises regularly, you should notice an improvement."

If you often leak urine when you sneeze, laugh, cough, or exercise, you probably have
a condition called stress incontinence. There are treatments that work well, including
simple exercises.

You can use our information to talk to your doctor and decide which treatments are
best for you.

What is it?
Stress incontinence usually happens because the muscles that help control the flow
of urine from your bladder have become weak.

If they're weak, these muscles can't cope with any extra pressure on them, say from
a sneeze. So if you do sneeze, your bladder neck opens for a second. This lets a bit
of urine leak out.

The muscles usually affected are your:


pelvic floor muscles. These muscles support your bladder and help it hold in urine



urethral sphincter. This ring of muscles controls the release of urine from your bladder and into your
urethra (the tube that carries urine out of your body). It works like a valve. When
it opens, urine flows out of your bladder. When it closes, it helps to hold urine
in your bladder.



Many women get stress incontinence after they've had a baby. You're also more likely
to get stress incontinence if you:



are older


have been through the menopause


get constipation often


consume caffeine


do a strenuous activity such as weight lifting, or


are overweight.


What are the symptoms?
If you have stress incontinence, you leak urine when there's extra pressure on your
bladder and the muscles around it. This often happens when you cough, sneeze, laugh,
exercise, or lift things.

Usually only a little urine leaks, and it happens very quickly. If you have these
symptoms and they bother you, you should see your doctor.

It's usually clear from your symptoms whether you have stress incontinence. But your
doctor will ask you questions and may do some tests. Sometimes your symptoms can be
caused or made worse by another condition, such as a urinary tract infection.

There are different types of incontinence and your doctor will also want to confirm
which type you have.

For example, urge incontinence is when you have a sudden and strong urge to pass urine.
The urine comes out in a rush that you can't control. It is usually treated differently
to stress incontinence, although sometimes people have both stress and urge incontinence
(called mixed incontinence).

What treatments work?
Doctors usually recommend that women first try simple treatments, such as changes
to their lifestyle and pelvic floor exercises, before thinking about medicines or
surgery.

Lifestyle changes
Certain aspects of your lifestyle may be making your stress incontinence worse. These
include consuming caffeine, drinking lots of liquids, and doing types of exercise
that put extra strain on your pelvic floor muscles (such as lifting weights).

Reducing or stopping these things may help improve your symptoms. Stopping smoking
and drinking less alcohol may also help.

If you have frequent constipation, getting treatment for this may improve your stress
incontinence as well. And if you are overweight, losing weight can also help.

Pelvic floor exercises
Pelvic floor exercises strengthen the muscles in your pelvis that help control the flow of urine from your
bladder. The exercises involve repeatedly tightening (contracting) and releasing these
muscles several times each day. You may also hear these exercises called Kegel exercises.

One way to identify your pelvic floor muscles is to lie down and put your finger in
your vagina. Then squeeze your muscles as if you're trying to stop urine coming out.
If you feel tightness on your finger, then you've found the right muscles.

You can do these exercises anywhere and at any time. For example, you can do them
while watching television. But you need to concentrate, especially at first.

Your doctor, nurse, or a physiotherapist can provide additional advice on how to do
these exercises. You can also see our leaflet Stress incontinence: how to do pelvic floor exercises.

If you’re finding it difficult to do pelvic floor exercises, your doctor might suggest
trying biofeedback or electrical stimulation.



Biofeedback can help you learn where your pelvic floor muscles are and how to do pelvic
floor exercises correctly. A nurse or physiotherapist puts a monitor in your vagina
or rectum. This doesn't hurt.

You then attempt to tighten your pelvic floor muscles. You know that you're doing
the pelvic floor exercises correctly when a sound goes off or an image appears on
a screen.



Electrical stimulation can be used instead of pelvic floor exercises. A nurse or physiotherapist
puts a probe in your vagina or rectum, and passes an electric current through the
probe and into your pelvic floor muscles.

This makes the muscles tighten. You shouldn't feel any pain. If you're comfortable
using the machine yourself, you can do this at home.



Vaginal devices
These are devices that are put in your vagina to help support the neck of your bladder
to stop the leakage of urine. They are made of plastic or other materials, and are
fitted by your doctor or nurse. They are sometimes called vaginal pessaries.

Medicines
If the above lifestyle changes and treatments haven't helped, your doctor may recommend
taking medicines that can help strengthen the muscles controlling the release of urine
from your bladder.



Usually the first medicine people try is pseudoephedrine. This medicine is often used to treat a stuffy nose, but it can also help with stress
incontinence.



Some medicines that are usually used to treat depression can also be effective for
stress incontinence.



If you have gone through the menopause, your doctor might also recommend using a cream,
ring, or vaginal tablets that contain the hormone oestrogen. You put all these treatments in your vagina.

After the menopause, your body makes less oestrogen than before. Oestrogen helps to
keep your muscles healthy, including your pelvic floor muscles and the sphincter muscles
that control the flow of urine from your bladder.

These treatments may help improve stress incontinence by replacing some of the oestrogen
that you have lost.

All these medicines can sometimes cause side effects. Your doctor will discuss these
with you before you start treatment.

Surgery
If other treatments haven’t helped, or if your stress incontinence is severe, your
doctor may recommend having surgery. There are several types of surgery. You and your
doctor can talk about what type is best for you. Most operations fall into two general
categories:



Surgery to support the bladder neck. There are many different approaches for this type of surgery. Some of the most common
involve putting a sling in place to support the bladder neck. This should make it
less likely that you will leak urine when your bladder is put under stress.



Surgery to help the urethral sphincter stay closed. This surgery usually involves injecting a substance - called a bulking agent - in
the tissue around your urethra and bladder neck.

Examples of bulking agents include special beads and gels. The bulking agent presses
on your urethra to help it stay closed when you're not passing urine.



A newer treatment that can help some women with an over-active bladder is called neuromodulation. This involves implanting a small battery-powered device in one of your buttocks.

This device helps control the signals from the nerves near your bladder to your brain,
so that you have more control over when you need to urinate.

What will happen to me?
Not all women with stress incontinence find it a problem. If you leak a little urine
only occasionally you may not be bothered by it.

But if stress incontinence starts to interfere with your daily life and what you can
do, you may lose confidence, and become less social and active. Treatment can help
you get your confidence back so that you can lead a full and active life."

Smoking can damage your health in many ways, but it can be hard to stop. That’s because
most people who smoke become addicted to nicotine, a chemical in tobacco. But there
are treatments available that can help you stop smoking.
You can use our information to talk to your doctor or pharmacist and decide which
treatments are best for you.

Why should I stop smoking?
You probably already know that smoking is one of the worst things you can do for your
health.

The good news is that smoking is on the decline in many countries. For example, in
the UK, only about 15 in every 100 people now smoke. Even so, about 80,000 people
die each year in the UK from diseases caused by smoking.



Every time you breathe in smoke you breathe in poisons that harm your body. The tar
and chemicals in tobacco smoke damage your lungs, making it harder to breathe.



Smokers get more coughs and lung infections than non-smokers.


You may get permanent lung damage, like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
or lung cancer.



Carbon monoxide from tobacco smoke gets into your blood and stops your blood carrying
as much oxygen as it needs to. This puts a strain on your heart and can make you feel
tired.



Smoke damages your blood vessels and makes them narrower. This increases your chance
of a heart attack or stroke.



About half of all smokers die of a disease caused by smoking. The most common ones
are lung cancer, heart disease, and strokes.



As well as lung cancer, smokers are more likely to get cancer of the intestine, throat,
pancreas, kidneys, bladder, or cervix.



On average, people who smoke live about 16 years less than people who don't smoke.


Your smoke can also harm other people around you. This is called passive smoking or
second-hand smoke.

For example, children's asthma is worse when they breathe in tobacco smoke. And smoking
around children means they get more coughs, chest infections, and ear infections.

If you smoke when you’re pregnant you can damage your baby’s health.
What makes it so hard to stop smoking?
If you're addicted to nicotine and you go longer than usual without a cigarette you
may feel depressed, irritable, anxious, unable to concentrate, or restless.

It's these feelings that make you reach for another cigarette. But once you break
your addiction, you stop getting these withdrawal symptoms. You’ll stop needing a
cigarette to feel better.

Certain things seem to increase a person's chances of getting addicted to nicotine.
These include:



smoking as a teenager


your genes


family problems


feeling depressed or having other mental health problems


having substance abuse problems


having parents who smoke.


What treatments are available?
The good news is that people stop smoking every day. And there are treatments that
give you a better chance of stopping smoking than if you rely on willpower alone.


You may need to try several - or even many - times before you're able to stop smoking
for good. But the important thing is to keep trying. It could save your life.

Professional help
Asking your doctor for help is a great first step. Research shows that getting advice,
counselling, and support from a doctor, nurse, or counsellor increases your chances
of stopping successfully.

There are many different types of counselling. Here are some examples:


One-off advice from your doctor, backed up with leaflets and the phone numbers of
helplines



A regular weekly session with someone trained to help people stop smoking (a nurse,
psychologist, or counsellor)



Group therapy with a counsellor, where you and other people meet regularly to share
your experiences of giving up.



You may want to try other types of help as well as counselling: for example, taking
medicines. However, taking medicines, including nicotine replacement products, is
not recommended for pregnant or breastfeeding women.

Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT)
NRT products provide a small supply of nicotine to your body. If you use NRT it's
recommended that you use it for up to three months after you stop smoking.

NRT comes as patches, gum, inhalers, lozenges, tablets that you put under your tongue,
and a nasal spray. You can buy these products from a pharmacy, or you might be able
to get them on prescription from your doctor.

But if you've recently had a heart attack or you have an unusual heart rhythm (a condition
called arrhythmia), you should talk to your doctor before trying NRT.

Some people get some side effects while using NRT. For example



Nicotine gum can cause hiccups, an upset stomach, jaw pain, or dental problems



Nicotine patches can cause itching where you've worn a patch, and



Nicotine inhalers and sprays may irritate your mouth or nose.



But these side effects only last as long as you need to use the NRT products.
NRT products are not recommended if you are pregnant or breastfeeding, or if you are
under 18 years old.

Medications
Bupropion is a medication usually used to treat depression, but it can also help people stop
smoking. You will need a prescription from your doctor for this treatment.

You start taking bupropion one or two weeks before the day you plan to stop and continue
taking it for seven to 12 weeks after you stop smoking.

Some antidepressants, including bupropion, may increase the risk of suicide or self-harm, especially in young people. If you are worried by any thoughts or feelings you have
while taking bupropion, see your doctor.

If you're pregnant or breastfeeding you shouldn't take bupropion. Other people who should not take bupropion include:



those with diabetes


those aged under 18


people with a history of seizures


people with eating disorders, and


people who take medicines called monoamine oxidase inhibitors.


Varenicline is another drug than can help people stop smoking. You need a prescription from your
doctor for this medicine. It helps ease withdrawal symptoms and blocks the effects
of nicotine if you start smoking again. It seems to be the most effective medication
for helping people stop smoking.

You start taking varenicline one or two weeks before you plan to stop smoking, and
you take it for 12 weeks. If you stop smoking, you can continue taking it for an additional
12 weeks.

Varenicline can cause side effects in some people. The most common ones are feeling
sick and vomiting, headaches, and sleep problems.

You can't take varenicline if you are pregnant or breastfeeding, or if you are under
18.

Electronic cigarettes (vaping)
Many people prefer electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes or vaping) to other NRT methods,
because it is more like smoking a real cigarette.

But, as well as nicotine, vaping products can contain many substances that could be
harmful. So, vaping is not completely safe, and it's not as safe as other NRT methods.

Vaping is thought to be safer than smoking real cigarettes. But vaping hasn't been
around for long enough to know about it's long-term effects.

If you're pregnant or breastfeeding
NRT and drug treatments are not recommended for women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.
But this doesn't mean that there isn't any help available. Doctors are really keen
to help pregnant or breastfeeding women to stop smoking, so do ask for help. The recommended
treatment will probably be counselling.

If you can't stop, try cutting down
Stopping smoking is hard - so hard that some people think they can't do it.
But if you don't think you can stop altogether, you can reduce the harm smoking does
to you by smoking less (cutting down). And research suggests that people who start
by cutting down often go on to stop smoking altogether.

Obviously the best thing for your health is not to smoke at all. But cutting down
is the next best thing. Many people find that using NRT products helps them to smoke
less. You can talk to your doctor about the approach that's best for you.

What to expect in the future
Giving up smoking is the best thing you can do for your health. Almost as soon as
you stop smoking, your body starts to clear itself of the poisonous chemicals found
in smoke. Here's what happens:



Your blood pressure and pulse rate will drop within 60 minutes of stopping


The amount of carbon monoxide in your blood will return to normal within 48 hours


Your sense of taste and your sense of smell will improve within a few days


Your blood circulation will improve in two to 12 weeks.


Stopping smoking reduces the chances that you'll get lung cancer or any of the other
health problems that are linked with smoking. If you stop smoking before the age of
35, you avoid most of the health problems linked with smoking. But even if you stop
after the age of 50, you reduce your chances of dying from a disease linked to smoking.

You may face some temporary problems when you stop smoking and are getting over your
nicotine addiction. For example, some people feel depressed and anxious, or find it
hard to concentrate. Some smokers who stop may get sore throats, coughs, and other
cold symptoms.

But these symptoms seem to last for just a few weeks after you stop. For many people,
the biggest drawback to stopping smoking is putting on weight. The average weight
gain is about 4.2 kilograms (10 pounds).

But you could work on a plan to minimise weight gain through better diet and exercise.
In fact, many people choose to see stopping smoking as part of a more general approach
to healthier living.

Where to get more help
If you want to stop smoking, your doctor is a good place to start. Doctors are more
than happy to offer help to people who want to stop smoking. For example, in the UK,
the NHS provides free help and advice for people who want to give up smoking."

It is important to use sunscreen when you're out in strong sunshine for more than
a short time. This helps protect your skin from sun damage and reduces your chance
of getting skin cancer.
But you need to make sure you use a sunscreen that gives enough protection.
This leaflet is about protecting your skin from the sun.
But it's actually important to spend some time in the sun. This is because sunlight
is the main way that we get vitamin D. Vitamin D is found in some foods. But it's hard to get enough vitamin D just from
diet alone.

In countries that don't get much sun in the winter, doctors often recommend that people
take vitamin D supplements in those months.

Vitamin D is important in keeping our immune system working well, and in keeping our
bones and teeth strong. It also helps protect against many health problems, including:



several types of cancer, including breast cancer, prostate cancer, and colon cancer


heart disease


diabetes


depression, and


weight gain.


So how much sun is a safe and helpful amount? The answer is that we don't really know.
Some doctors advise that being outside with your arms uncovered for about 20 minutes
a day is enough to get the vitamin D that you need.

What we do know is that the chance of skin cancer is greater if your skin burns.
So, while it's healthy to expose some skin to the sun for a short time, it's important
to avoid sunburn.

If you are going to spend longer in the sun - for example if you are on holiday, going
for a long walk on a hot day, or gardening in sunny weather, you should think about
sunscreen.

Sunscreens protect you against a kind of sunlight called ultraviolet (UV) light. There are two main types of UV light that affect the skin: UV-A and UV-B. UV-A can
cause skin cancer and wrinkling. UV-B can cause skin cancer and burning.

Some ingredients in sunscreens protect you against one type of UV light but not the
other. To get protection against both types of UV light, use a sunscreen that’s labelled
as a broad-spectrum sunscreen.

Also, look for a sunscreen with high SPF rating. SPF stands for sun protection factor.
It indicates how much protection the sunscreen provides against UV-B light. The highest
SPF that can be legally marketed in most countries is 50. You shouldn’t go any lower
than 15, as this won’t protect your skin against cancer.

Here are some other tips for protecting yourself and your family when you're out in
the sun.



If possible, stay out of the sun when it's at its hottest. This could be as long as
between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. if you are in a hot country.



Wear a hat.


When possible, wear clothing that covers your skin, such as long-sleeved tops, trousers,
or a long skirt or dress.



Wear sunglasses. These will help protect your eyes and the skin around them.


Spread the sunscreen evenly on all the skin that will be in the sun.


Use enough sunscreen. To get the right amount, use the 'two-finger rule'. Squeeze
out sunscreen along the length of your first two fingers. Use this much sunscreen
on each of these parts of your body: your head, neck, and face; each arm; upper back;
lower back; chest; stomach; each upper leg (back and front); and each lower leg (back
and front). This can take some time to do properly.



Put on sunscreen 15 minutes before you go out in the sun.


Reapply your sunscreen regularly. Try to reapply at least every two hours, and more
often if you've been swimming or sweating a lot.



Reapply sunscreen more often when you're out in the snow or in water. The sun's rays
reflect off the surface of snow and water, which means you get more sun.



Don't stay in the sun longer just because you're using sunscreen. You can still get
burnt. If you use sunscreen to stay in the sun longer, you can actually increase your
chances of getting skin cancer.



Don't use sunbeds.


See your doctor if you notice any new blemishes or changes in a mole.
Take extra care with children's skin
Children and teenagers are more likely to spend a long time in the sun, so it's important
to take special care of their skin. If the sun damages their skin, they're more likely
to get skin cancer when they get older.

Babies under 6 months old should stay out of the sun because their skin is thin and
sensitive, and sunscreens may give them a rash."

If you get angina, taking medicines is an important part of your treatment, but it’s
not the only thing you need to do to stay healthy. Your doctor will also talk to you
about other steps you should take to improve your health and stop your angina and
heart disease getting worse.

Here's a list of some things your doctor might suggest.


Stop smoking. If you smoke, now is the time to stop. The more you smoke, the greater
your chance of dying from heart disease. You can talk to your doctor about treatments
that can help.



Try to lose weight if you are obese or overweight. It may help to see a dietitian.
Your doctor can also tell you about lifestyle changes, diets, and treatments that
can help.



Eat a healthy diet. You should eat at least five servings of fruit and vegetables
every day, eat at least one serving of oily fish (such as salmon) every week, and
cut back on fatty food and on sugary food and drinks.



Take reasonable exercise. Talk to your doctor about what kind of exercise and how
much is safe for you. Many people find it helpful to increase how much they exercise
gradually.

Some people also choose to fit simple exercises into their day-to-day life: for example,
by walking up the last flight of stairs at the office or by getting off the bus one
stop early and walking the rest of the way.



Limit how much alcohol you drink. Drinking guidelines vary between countries. In the
UK, for example, the advice is not to drink more than 14 units of alcohol a week,
and that you shouldn't drink more than a few units in one day

One unit is half a pint of ordinary-strength beer or a pub measure (25 millilitres)
of a spirit, such as whisky or gin. A small glass (125 millilitres) of wine is about
one and a half units. But bear in mind that different wines and beers have different
strengths of alcohol.



Learn how to manage stress. Exercising regularly and getting enough sleep can help.
You might also consider taking a class in meditation or allowing yourself 15 to 20
minutes each day to sit quietly, breathe deeply, and imagine a peaceful scene.

When you're feeling angry, try counting to 10 to give yourself time to calm down.
You might ask your doctor for other suggestions about managing stress.



Use a self-help angina plan. If you just found out that you have angina, a self-help
angina plan may help you feel better and feel less anxious and depressed. These plans
often involve working through a workbook, with regular support and advice from a nurse.
You can ask your doctor about this kind of plan.



Closely follow your doctor’s recommendations on treatments, lifestyle changes, and
follow-up appointments. This will give you the best chance of staying healthy."

If you have stable angina you get pain and discomfort when your heart muscle needs
to work harder than usual (for example, when you're physically active). This is because
the blood vessels leading to your heart muscle are narrowed, so your heart doesn't
get enough oxygen. To read more about the causes and symptoms of stable angina, see
the leaflet Stable angina: what is it?

You might worry about how angina will affect your life and what will happen to you.
But there are good treatments that can control angina attacks and help you stay active.

You might hear your doctor call stable angina ""stable ischaemic heart disease"".
You’ll probably need to take a few types of medicine. The aims of treatment are to:


prevent complications of heart disease, such as heart attacks


relieve discomfort and pain caused by angina


improve your quality of life.


There are also things you can do to improve your chances of staying healthy.
Medicine for angina pain
Glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) is a tablet you place under your tongue. It can make the
pain of an angina attack go away quickly, within a few minutes. It widens your blood
vessels, letting more blood flow through so your heart gets the oxygen it needs.

You can carry GTN with you so it's ready to take if you have an angina attack. You
can also use it just before you do something that can bring on an attack, such as
going for a walk.

GTN also widens the blood vessels in your brain. This can cause a throbbing headache
that starts soon after you take it.

If you still have chest discomfort or pain after taking three doses of GTN over 15
minutes, get medical help straight away. You could be having a heart attack.

Things you can do to help yourself
If you have angina there are many things you can do to reduce your chance of having
a heart attack or stroke. Doing these things may also mean you have fewer angina attacks.



If you smoke, get help to stop. Your doctor can advise you on ways to stop smoking.
Smoking makes your arteries more narrow.



Keep to a healthy weight. This might involve changing your diet to include more fresh
fruit and vegetables and fewer processed, fatty, or sugary foods.



Take regular gentle exercise - but discuss this with your doctor first.


Try to limit how much alcohol you drink.


Try to recognise and avoid things that cause you stress.


To learn more, see the leaflet Stable angina: what you can do to help yourself.
Medicines to prevent a heart attack
If you have angina your chance of having a heart attack or stroke is greater than
normal. Your doctor might suggest treatments to reduce your risk. He or she will probably
suggest medicines to:



stop your blood from clotting too easily


lower your cholesterol, and


control your blood pressure.


Medicines to help prevent blood clots
Your doctor might suggest that you take a low dose of aspirin to reduce your chance
of having a heart attack. Aspirin makes your blood 'thinner', so you are less likely
to get a blood clot that could block your arteries.

But aspirin can cause ulcers or bleeding in the stomach for some people. If aspirin
isn't suitable for you (for example, if you've had a stomach ulcer before) you might
be able to take a similar drug, called clopidogrel.

Medicines to lower cholesterol
Drugs called statins can lower your cholesterol, which can help protect you from having
a heart attack or stroke. Taking statins can lead to side effects in some people,
including liver damage, muscle pain and muscle damage, and kidney damage. You may
need blood tests to check that your liver and kidneys are working properly.

Medicines to lower blood pressure
Drugs called ACE inhibitors can help protect you from a heart attack or stroke by
lowering your blood pressure. They can cause side effects, including a dry cough.
If you can’t take an ACE inhibitor, your doctor may suggest a similar drug called
an angiotensin 2 receptor blocker (ARB).

Medicines to prevent angina attacks
If you are finding your angina troublesome, your doctor may suggest you take medicine
to reduce the number of attacks you get. If your angina troubles you a lot, your doctor
might suggest you take more than one of these medicines.

Beta-blockers are the first type of medicine most doctors recommend for controlling angina. Beta-blockers
also reduce your chances of having a heart attack or stroke.

They can cause side effects, including feeling tired and dizzy when you stand up,
and cold hands and feet. If you're a man and have erection problems, beta-blockers
can sometimes make them worse. Beta-blockers are not usually recommended for people
who have asthma, as they can worsen the symptoms.

If you can't take a beta-blocker, or if your doctor thinks you need extra medication,
he or she might suggest you take a calcium channel blocker. These drugs can cut your chances of having a heart attack or stroke. Possible side
effects include flushing, swollen ankles, dizziness when standing up quickly, and
low blood pressure.

Long-acting nitrates are drugs that help widen your blood vessels. They come as tablets
or as ointment you rub on your skin. But your body can get used to long-acting nitrates,
which means they stop working so well. To avoid this you take nitrates only at certain
times.

In some people long-acting nitrates may cause headaches, dizziness and fainting, and red or flushed skin. These medicines
are usually offered to people who can't take other medicines that prevent angina attacks,
or as additional medicines for people with more severe symptoms.

Other treatments
If you can't take the usual angina treatments there are other, newer medicines that
you might be able to try. But we don't know as much about how well these newer drugs
work or about their possible side effects.

Surgical procedures, such as coronary angioplasty or a coronary artery bypass, are
usually only recommended for people with stable angina whose symptoms are very severe,
people whose angina symptoms are not controlled by medicines, and people at high risk
of having a heart attack or stroke."

If you have angina you might worry about how it will affect your life and what will
happen to you. But there are good treatments that can control angina attacks and help
you stay active.

This information is about stable angina caused by coronary artery disease. It’s called
stable because it has a regular pattern. It’s the most common type of angina.

What is stable angina?
People usually get angina because they have coronary artery disease. A coronary artery
is a blood vessel that carries blood that is rich in oxygen to the heart. In coronary
artery disease, clumps of fat build up on the lining inside the arteries. Over time
the arteries become narrow.

If your coronary arteries become too narrow your heart might not get enough blood
at times when it needs to work harder than usual.

This means that your heart muscle doesn't get enough oxygen to pump properly. This
can cause discomfort or pain. This is the pain you feel when you have an angina attack.

Things that can make your heart work harder and bring on an angina attack include:


increased physical activity


going out in cold weather


feeling upset or excited.


When you are resting your heart doesn't have to work so hard. So it has enough oxygen
and you shouldn’t feel discomfort.

Stable angina has a regular pattern. You get it when your heart is working harder than usual and
it goes away if you rest or take your angina medicine. You can learn to recognise
the pattern.

Another type of angina is called unstable angina. If you have this type of angina you might get symptoms at any time, even when you’re
resting. There’s no regular pattern to your symptoms and you might have bad pain that
lasts longer.

Having angina increases your chance of having a heart attack. So it’s important to
get treatment.

What are the symptoms?
Stable angina affects people in different ways.


Some people say it feels like a weight on their chest, or like a crushing sensation.


You might have pain in your neck and jaw, or in your back.


You might have pain down one or both arms.


Some people feel sick or exhausted or sweat more than usual.


Sometimes being breathless is the only symptom.


Usually the discomfort goes away when you stop and rest. It lasts between one and
three minutes. It might take longer to go away if you have been angry or upset.

If it lasts only a few seconds, or if it is a dull ache lasting for hours, it's probably
not angina.

It's important to recognise how your angina feels and what brings it on. You should
tell your doctor about any changes in the pattern of your angina: for example, if
it feels different from usual or if you start to get it more often.

You should get medical help straight away if your angina:


lasts longer than usual


comes on when you are resting


is worse than usual


doesn't go away, even after you've taken your angina medicine (glyceryl trinitrate)
three times.



These might be signs that your angina is getting worse and you and your doctor need
to look again at your treatment.

What will happen to me?
If you have angina it's normal to worry about how it will affect your life. Having
angina means you’re more likely to have a heart attack.

But living a healthy lifestyle and taking the right medicines gives you the best chance
of staying in good health. To read about treatments for stable angina and ways to
stay healthy, see our leaflet Stable angina: what treatments work?

Where to get more help
There are various organisations and charities that offer information and advice to
people with stable angina. For example, in the UK, the British Heart Foundation (bhf.org.uk)
runs a network of local Heart Support Groups around the country. Ask your doctor about
similar organisations where you live."

https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/3000273/Spinal%20stenosis,Spinal stenosis,"Spinal stenosis Last published: Jun 06, 2022
Spinal stenosis is the narrowing of the holes that run through the centre of the bones
in the spine. This narrowing can put pressure on the nerves that run through the spine,
causing pain and problems with movement.

Spinal stenosis happens as we get older and our bones are less strong than they used
to be. There is no cure, but there are treatments that can help with the symptoms.

You can use our information to talk to your doctor about the best treatments for you.
What is spinal stenosis?
The human spine (also called the backbone or spinal column) is not just one bone. It’s a column of bones called vertebrae, which run from the neck down to the pelvis.

Each separate bone (or vertebra) has a hole running through it. Together these holes
form a channel for a rope of nerves to pass through, a bit like a bundle of internet cables.

These nerves carry messages from the brain to other parts of the body, allowing us
to move, and to feel sensations such as pain, heat, and cold.

Spinal stenosis can happen as we age. What happens is that:



the bones in the spine get weaker


normal downward pressure from the weight of our upper body causes the vertebrae to
flatten



this flattening makes the vertebrae wider, so that the holes that run through them
get narrower



this narrowing can put pressure on the nerves that run through the holes, causing
pain in the lower back and the legs.



In people with spinal stenosis, symptoms usually start between the ages of 50 and
70 years. Other things that might make someone more likely to have spinal stenosis
as they get older include:



smoking


a previous back injury


having had spine surgery


a hormone problem called acromegaly, which causes excessive bone growth in childhood, and



a type of dwarfism called achondroplasia.



It’s hard to say how common spinal stenosis is. This is because back pain is common.
And the symptoms are easily confused with those of other back problems, such as a
slipped disc (the medical name is disc herniation).

What are the symptoms?
Not everyone with spinal stenosis will have all the same symptoms. But common symptoms
can include:



back pain, especially when being active or moving around


leg pain when walking


a stooped posture when walking


numbness or partial loss of feeling in the legs. This loss of feeling is called paraesthesia


pain that radiates down the leg.


If you see your doctor with symptoms like these, they will examine you and ask you
very specific questions about your symptoms, to try to pinpoint what is causing them.

This is because small differences in symptoms can point to different causes. For example,
people with spinal stenosis tend to have leg pain when walking, but not when cycling
- because there is no downward pressure on the leg while cycling.

Your doctor might also suggest that you have a scan. This might not be able to show if you have spinal stenosis. But it can help to find
or rule out other problems.

What treatments are available?
The aims of treatment for spinal stenosis are to:


relieve your pain as much as possible


help you to walk and move around more easily


make your spine as stable as possible, and


treat or prevent any problems caused by pressure on the nerves in your spine, such
as numbness or loss of feeling.



Temporary rest
The first treatment that your doctor might suggest is simply giving your back a rest
for a few days, until your pain settles down.

But this does not mean bed rest. Too much bed rest can make back problems worse. So your doctor will
suggest that you take a break from movements that involve:



bending


lifting, and


twisting.


Medicines
Your doctor will probably also suggest that you start treatment with medicines that
help to reduce inflammation (swelling).

By reducing swelling in your spinal column, this helps reduce the pressure on your
nerves that is causing your symptoms.

The first drugs your doctor will suggest will probably be non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). You might have heard of some of these, such as ibuprofen and naproxen.

If these drugs don’t help your symptoms enough, your doctor might suggest a course
of stronger anti-inflammatories called corticosteroids. But these drugs can have serious side effects in some people, so your doctor will
probably only prescribe them for a short time.

NSAIDs and corticosteroids can cause stomach problems. So your doctor should prescribe
medicine to protect your stomach, especially if you take both medicines together.

If your symptoms are very severe, your doctor might suggest that you have an injection of corticosteroids near to your spine.

Things you can do for yourself
There are things you can do to help relieve your symptoms apart from taking medicines.
You can talk with your doctor about what might help you in particular. It might include
things such as:



changing the activities that you do where possible, to avoid the ones that cause you
pain, and to get the most out of the ones you can do



using physical aids, such as walkers


having physiotherapy. Your doctor might be able to help arrange this for you


getting as much exercise as you can. You can talk to your doctor about what types
of exercise are suitable for you



seeking advice from a specialist, such as an osteopath. Your doctor can advise you
about how this might help



having massage and heat treatments, and


a spinal brace or corset for a short time.


Surgery
Many people find that medicines help to relieve their symptoms fairly quickly. But
if you find that they don’t help much, your doctor might suggest surgery.

This operation involves a surgeon widening the gaps that the nerves pass through,
by removing excess tissue and bone.

Spine surgery is a major operation and, like all types of surgery, there are risks.
For example:



surgery for spinal stenosis is helpful for many people, but some people find that
it doesn’t make much difference. For some people, surgery can actually make their
symptoms worse



this type of operation tends to be more helpful for people whose main symptom is leg pain rather than back pain



the benefits of this type of surgery don’t last forever. Most people find that their
symptoms start to get worse again about four years after surgery, and that after eight
years they are the same as before they had surgery.



Your doctor should discuss all the possible pros and cons of surgery with you. They
might also give you some material to read, or direct you to online video information,
to help you decide whether surgery is the right option for you.

What to expect in the future
Many people find that their symptoms improve with medicine. If you’re doing well it’s
still a good idea to see your doctor once or twice a year, just so they can make sure
you’re getting the best possible treatment.

If you’re not doing as well as you hoped, you might want to talk to your doctor about
surgery.

Whatever treatment you have, it’s important to remember that spinal stenosis is a
complaint that comes with getting older. This means that it’s not going to go away
completely, even if treatments help.

But you can help yourself by keeping as mobile as possible. Exercising and being as
active as you can help to stop your bones and muscles from weakening further."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/3000137/Spinal%20cord%20compression%3A%20what%20treatments%20work%3F,Spinal cord compression: what treatments work?,"Spinal cord compression: what treatments work? Last published: Oct 10, 2022
Spinal cord compression happens when there is too much pressure on the bundle of nerves
in the middle of your spine (backbone). This pressure can build up over time because
of a long-term condition, or it can happen suddenly, usually because of an injury.

The pressure can sometimes be relieved with treatment. But often there is more serious,
permanent damage, which can affect your ability to do many things, including walking.

What treatments work?
The spinal cord is a long bundle of nerve fibres that connect the brain to other parts
of the body. It sits in a fluid-filled sac, and runs through the middle of the bones
in your spine (the vertebrae). The bones help protect the delicate nerve fibres.

Spinal cord compression happens when pressure on the nerves stops them from working
properly or stops blood from getting to the nerves.

This damage can be sudden (what doctors call acute) or can happen gradually because of a long-term condition (doctors call long-term
conditions chronic).

For more background information, see our leaflet: Spinal cord compression: what is it?
The aims of treatment for spinal cord compression are to:


prevent the damage to your spinal cord from getting worse


relieve pain and other symptoms, and


help you to be able to move as much as possible.


If you have severe symptoms you should ideally be treated at a specialist trauma centre
with staff who are experienced in treating spinal cord compression.

Treatments for acute (sudden) spinal cord compression
The main treatment for spinal cord compression is surgery to relieve the pressure
on the nerves, restore the blood flow, and repair any damaged tissue.

Successful surgery can relieve pressure on the nerves in the spinal column so that
they can work properly again. But sometimes the nerves have been too badly damaged
to recover.

In some people this means that they do not recover some of their movement: for example,
some people might have numbness or weakness in some limbs, or not be able to move
some or all of their limbs. Some people are paralysed, either below the waist, or
from the neck down.

Whether you need surgery or not, you will probably need some medications. These might
include medications to:



reduce swelling around the spinal cord, and


increase your blood pressure if it has fallen too low. This can happen in people with
spinal cord compression.



Many people need to have a soft plastic tube called a catheter inserted to help them
empty their bladder.

If your symptoms are caused by cauda equina you will need to have surgery on your lower back to reduce the pressure on your spinal
column. If your symptoms affect your bladder, it’s a sign of a serious injury, and
you will need to have surgery as soon as possible.

If the pressure on your spinal column is caused by an abscess (an infection) on the spine, you will need surgery to drain the abscess. This should
relieve the pressure on the nerves in your spine. You will then need to take antibiotics
for several months to make sure the infection is gone.

Treatment for a tumour  on the spine is usually aimed at making you as comfortable as possible. It is not
usually possible to cure the cancer that caused the tumour.

This is because tumours on the spine tend to be caused by another type of cancer that
has spread to the spine. At this point, the cancer has probably spread to the point
where it cannot be cured.

You might still be able to have surgery to remove the tumour on your spine, and medicines
to reduce swelling. Some people can also have radiotherapy to help kill the cancer
cells.

What will happen?
The damage from spinal cord compression varies a great deal:


In some people, the pressure on the nerves can be relieved with no lasting effects.




Other people have symptoms that come and go. They might need to do special rehabilitation
exercises and avoid some activities, but they don’t need surgery.



Some people have badly damaged nerves that can’t be repaired, leaving them with long-term
problems ranging from numbness to paralysis.



The outlook often depends on what caused the injury to your spine.
And it’s not always possible for doctors to give a clear answer straight away about
how much someone might recover. It can take time to understand the extent of the damage,
and how much someone is likely to improve.

Many people will need to do rehabilitation, possibly for the rest of their lives.
This will probably involve stretching and muscle exercises. Your doctor or physiotherapist
will help you to learn an exercise programme that is right for you.

For some people, serious spinal nerve damage means that they can’t use the toilet
in the way they used to. So they need to learn how to use things like catheters and
special bags that collect urine and faeces.

If you need this type of help, your medical team will help you to learn how to use
the techniques and equipment you need.

A serious spinal injury is life changing. And it can be hugely difficult to deal with
emotionally - especially without help.

Your medical team will, of course, be very supportive. But your doctor should also
be able to arrange for you to speak to someone about how you feel, and about coping
with the changes in your life.

He or she might also be able to help you find a group of people with similar experiences
in your area or online.

For example, in the UK, charities such as Aspire (aspire.org.uk) and Back Up (backuptrust.org.uk)
offer counselling and practical support for people with serious spinal injuries."

What is spinal cord compression?
The spinal cord is a long bundle of nerve fibres that connect the brain to other parts
of the body. It sits in a fluid-filled sac, and runs through the middle of the bones
in your spine (the vertebrae). The bones help protect the delicate nerve fibres.

It might help to think of the spinal column as like a bundle of electrical wires coming
out of a main fuse box, which eventually branch off to provide power to different
rooms in a building.

Spinal cord compression happens when pressure on the nerves stops them from working
properly or stops blood from getting to the nerves.

This damage can be sudden (what doctors call acute) or can happen gradually because of a long-term condition (doctors call long-term
conditions chronic).

Acute spinal cord compression can be caused by many things, including:



accidents, such as vehicle accidents, falls, and sports injuries


a slipped disc (herniation). This is when the soft tissue that sits between two vertebrae
slips out of place and presses on the nerves



the bones in the spine slipping out of line with each other


puncture wounds, such as knife and bullet wounds, and


damage caused by medical treatment: for example, during surgery.


Chronic spinal cord compression usually happens because of:



gradual weakening of the bones in the spine. This can happen because of conditions
that weaken the spine, or just because of ageing



a tumour (cancer) on or near the spine, or


an infection that causes swelling or an abscess on the spine.


Tumours on the spine usually happen when someone has another type of cancer (such
as lung, prostate, or breast cancer), which then spreads to other parts of the body,
including the spine.

The damage caused by compression can range from fairly mild to very severe.
For example, a condition called cauda equina, where the nerves in the lower back become compressed, causes pain and numbness that
can often be treated and relieved. But it does not usually cause severe disability.


This is also often true for the problems caused by a slipped disc, which often come and go, causing temporary pain and lack of mobility, without causing
permanent disability.

On the other hand, people with severe compression from other causes, such as bad accidents and tumours, often cannot walk, control
their bladder and bowels, or even breathe without help.

What are the symptoms?
The symptoms of spinal cord compression can vary, depending on which nerves are affected,
and on what has caused the compression.

For example, someone who has been in a vehicle accident and is struggling to move
normally will have clear symptoms that suggest a spinal cord injury.

But in someone with a chronic condition where compression has taken time to develop,
the symptoms could be less clear and very different.

Depending on what has caused your problems, you could have symptoms that could affect:




your senses


your muscles, or


your organs.


Or you could have symptoms that overlap all of these areas.
Symptoms that affect the senses are called sensory symptoms. These can include:



a reduced sense of touch and being less able to feel pain


being less able to feel vibrations


being less able to sense changes in temperature, and


loss of feeling on one side of your body.


Symptoms that affect movement are called motor symptoms. They can include:



being less able to move the limbs on one side of your body


weakness on one side of your body


inability to move your legs


inability to move any of your limbs


weakness in your legs or in all of your limbs.


Symptoms that affect your organs are called autonomic symptoms. They can include:



constipation


being unable to urinate


dizziness


feeling cold and shivering


drowsiness


being unable to get an erection (if you are a man)


pain in the abdomen (tummy), and


fainting.


All people with spinal cord compression, whatever the cause, are likely to be in pain
at least some of the time. The pain is usually worse with certain types of movement.

Examinations and tests
If your doctor suspects that you have spinal cord compression of any kind, you will
have a scan, usually an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) or CT (computerised tomography),
to make sure.

The scan will check for things like damage and compression of the spinal cord, as
well as abscesses (infections) and tumours.

If you are treated in hospital after an accident such as a vehicle accident or a fall,
the doctor will always check for a possible spine injury. If it seems likely that
your spine is injured, your doctor might also fit you with a neck collar to keep you
still and stable while he or she examines you.

If you are conscious and able to answer questions, your doctor will also ask you about
your injury. He or she will want to learn as much as possible about what happened,
to help them give you the best possible treatment.

Your doctor will ask you things like:


how your accident happened


how long ago it happened, and


what medical treatment, if any, you had at the time.


If you are not able to answer questions, perhaps because you are unconscious, your
doctor will ask anyone who was with you and saw the accident, and people who might
have helped you, such as paramedics.

If you have symptoms that suggest a longer-term cause of spinal cord compression,
the doctor will ask you:



about any recent falls or knocks


about any injuries that you can think of that happened less recently


about your job and hobbies, such as sports that you play


about any illnesses or other back problems you have


whether you inject illegal drugs


what medications you take


whether you have had surgery recently.


Your doctor will also want to examine you physically and test your reflexes.
You might also have blood tests and a test called a lumbar puncture, where some of
your spinal fluid is taken for testing.

What will happen?
The damage from spinal cord compression varies a great deal:


In some people, the pressure on the nerves can be relieved with no lasting effects.




Other people have symptoms that come and go. They might need to do special rehabilitation
exercises and avoid some activities, but they don’t need surgery.



Some people have badly damaged nerves that can’t be repaired, leaving them with long-term
problems ranging from numbness to paralysis.



The outlook often depends on what caused the injury to your spine.
And it’s not always possible for doctors to give a clear answer straight away about
how much someone might recover. It can take time to understand the extent of the damage,
and how much someone is likely to improve.

Many people will need to do rehabilitation, possibly for the rest of their lives.
This will probably involve stretching and muscle exercises. Your doctor or physiotherapist
will help you to learn an exercise programme that is right for you.

For some people, serious spinal nerve damage means that they can’t use the toilet
in the way they used to. So they need to learn how to use things like catheters and
special bags that collect urine and faeces.

If you need this type of help, your medical team will help you to learn how to use
the techniques and equipment you need.

A serious spinal injury is life changing. And it can be hugely difficult to deal with
emotionally - especially without help.

Your medical team will, of course, be very supportive. But your doctor should also
be able to arrange for you to speak to someone about how you feel, and about coping
with the changes in your life.

He or she might also be able to help you find a group of people with similar experiences
in your area or online.

For example, in the UK, charities such as Aspire (aspire.org.uk) and Back Up (backuptrust.org.uk)
offer counselling and practical support for people with serious spinal injuries."

A sore throat can be painful. But it usually clears up on its own after three or four
days. While you're recovering, there are things you can do to make yourself feel more
comfortable.

You can use our information to talk to your pharmacist or doctor about which treatments
are best for you.

What is a sore throat?
You can get a sore throat if your throat is infected with bacteria or a virus. Sore
throats are common and are often part of another illness, such as a cold. You might
also hear a sore throat called pharyngitis. 'Pharynx' is another word for the throat.

Viruses are the most common cause of a sore throat. Some viruses can cause very severe
sore throats. For example, glandular fever (also called infectious mononucleosis)
is caused by a virus.

A sore throat caused by bacteria is sometimes called strep throat. This is short for Streptococcus, the most common bacteria to cause a sore throat.

Other infections that can cause sore throats include gonorrhoea and oral thrush (infection
with a type of fungus called Candida). However, these are less common. Here, we look at sore throats caused by colds and
other common infections.

What are the symptoms?
The pain is usually at the back of your throat and probably feels worse when you swallow.
You may also have redness in your throat or white patches at the back of your throat. Some people get a headache or a fever.

Young children sometimes have trouble describing where their pain is coming from.
They may point to the part of their body that is hurting.

Most sore throats aren't serious. But you should call your doctor if you or your child
has:



difficulty swallowing or breathing


a temperature of more than 38°C (about 101°F)


very tender or swollen glands in the neck


painful sinuses, or


a cough with mucus.


What treatments work?
Most sore throats get better in a few days without any treatment. In the meantime
there are things you can try to help you feel more comfortable.

However, if you have strep throat, your doctor will probably recommend antibiotics.
Antibiotics kill bacteria. They don't work against viruses, which are the most common
cause of sore throats.

Ways to relieve your sore throat
There are some simple things you can do to help soothe a sore throat, including:


drinking warm tea with honey. But don't give honey to children under a year old, as
there is a chance they could develop a serious illness called botulism



gargling with salt water


sucking throat lozenges or hard sweets. But don't give hard sweets or lozenges to
young children, because they could choke on them.



Over-the-counter painkillers such as paracetamol and ibuprofen can also help with
the pain of a sore throat. These medicines come as tablets you swallow and as chewable
tablets and syrups, which are easier for children to take.

Aspirin is another option. But don't give aspirin to children or teenagers. It can
very occasionally cause a condition called Reye's syndrome, which affects the brain
and liver.

Aspirin and ibuprofen can irritate the stomach. They can also cause ulcers and bleeding
in some people.

Paracetamol doesn't irritate the stomach in the way that aspirin or ibuprofen may.
But it's very important not to take too much, because an overdose can damage your
liver.

Many cold and flu remedies contain paracetamol, so be careful if you or your child
is taking more than one treatment at a time. It's a good idea to talk to your pharmacist
if you have any questions or concerns about what's safe.

Antibiotics
Doctors often prescribe antibiotics for strep throat.
To find out whether someone has strep throat, doctors use a test called a rapid antigen test. This involves having a cotton swab rubbed on the back of your throat to collect
a sample of fluid. This sample is then tested for signs of the bacteria that cause
strep.

The test is fast, giving results in minutes. But it doesn't catch all cases of strep.
If this test is negative for strep, your doctor may do another test called a throat
culture. It can take a day or two to get the results from a throat culture.

If you test positive for strep (either through the rapid antigen test or throat culture)
your doctor will probably prescribe antibiotics.

Your doctor may also give you a prescription for antibiotics if you have had a throat
culture and are waiting for the results. That way, if your throat culture comes back
positive for strep, you can fill the prescription and start taking the antibiotics
straight away.

Taking antibiotics for strep can help stop the infection spreading to someone else
and will often make you feel better within 24 hours. It can also prevent the infection
from causing an ear infection, a throat abscess, and rare problems such as rheumatic
fever.

Antibiotics can cause side effects such as an upset stomach, diarrhoea, and a rash.
What will happen to me?
Sore throats usually clear up on their own in a few days. But sometimes the infection
that causes a sore throat can lead to other problems. If this happens, you may become
hoarse or lose your voice, get an ear infection, or get a sinus infection. If you
think you have an ear or sinus infection, see your doctor."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/3000010/Small%20bowel%20obstruction,Small bowel obstruction,"Small bowel obstruction Last published: Jul 06, 2020
A small bowel obstruction causes a blockage of your small intestine (bowel) that stops
food and liquid from passing through your digestive system. The obstruction can be
partial or complete. A bowel obstruction is a medical emergency that needs urgent
treatment.
What is a small bowel obstruction?
The small bowel is the upper part of the intestine that links the stomach to the large
bowel, which is the lower part of the digestive system. The small bowel is where we
absorb most of the nutrients from our food.

When there is a small bowel obstruction food and liquid can’t pass easily through
the bowel. With a total obstruction it can’t pass through at all. These obstructions
are usually caused by something pressing on the outside of the bowel or causing it
to twist, and not by something inside the intestine.

If the blockage is not removed the obstructed part of the bowel starts to die. It
then becomes perforated (torn). This leads to infection, multiple organ failure, and
death.

In adults, causes of small bowel obstruction include:


scar tissue from previous surgery


a type of hernia called an inguinal hernia. This happens when a part of your bowel
slips out of its usual position and pokes down into the groin



Crohn’s disease, a condition that causes inflammation (swelling) in the bowel


bowel cancer


appendicitis.


In children, causes of small bowel obstruction include:


appendicitis


intussusception - ‘telescoping’ of the bowel, when part of the bowel folds into itself




volvulus - twisting of the bowel


atresia - narrowing of the bowel.


What are the symptoms?
The main symptom of small bowel obstruction is that you won’t be able to pass stools
or pass gas (break wind) normally. If the obstruction is total you won’t be able to
pass them at all. This leads to other symptoms such as:



pain in the abdomen (tummy)


swelling and bloating in the abdomen


nausea


vomiting


fever. This can happen if you develop an infection in the lining of the abdomen


fatigue.


If your doctor thinks you have a small bowel obstruction he or she will want to find
out for sure as soon as possible. This is because tissue damage in the bowel can happen
quickly.

Your doctor will examine you, listen to the sounds in your abdomen with a stethoscope,
and ask you about your symptoms and your general medical history.

For example, your doctor will want to know about whether you have ever had surgery
in your abdomen, or if you have a condition that affects your digestive system, such
as Crohn’s disease.

He or she will also want to do some tests. These might include taking images of your
abdomen: for example, an x-ray or CT (computerised tomography) scan. These scans can
help your doctor find out the cause of the obstruction. You may also have a blood
test to find out whether other organs, such as your liver, have been affected.

What treatments work?
A small bowel obstruction is a medical emergency and you will need treatment in hospital.
If you have a complete obstruction you will almost certainly need surgery. But if
your bowel is only partly obstructed you might not need an operation.

First treatments
The first thing your doctor will do is to relieve your immediate symptoms. You will
be treated with:



intravenous (IV) fluids to make sure you are not dehydrated


nasogastric decompression. A tube is inserted through one of your nostrils down into
your stomach. The contents of your stomach can then be sucked out through the tube.
This relieves some of the pressure in your bowel



pain relief.


If you have an infection in your abdomen, or you are about to have surgery, you will
also need intravenous antibiotics.

During this first stage of treatment your doctor will also assess whether surgery
is the right treatment for you.

Surgery
Surgery is not always needed.


If you have a small partial obstruction it might go away without surgery. Your doctor
might suggest waiting a few days to see if non-surgical treatments work.



People who have a bowel obstruction caused by Crohn’s disease don’t usually need surgery.
People with Crohn’s disease usually get better with drugs or other treatments.



But many people need surgery, especially for a complete obstruction. The type of surgery
you have will depend on what has caused the obstruction.

For example, if your bowel obstruction has been caused by appendicitis you will need
an operation to remove your appendix. If your obstruction has been caused by a hernia
you will need an operation to repair the hernia.

What will happen?
A small bowel obstruction is a medical emergency. But if you get treatment quickly
the outlook is very good. So if you have the symptoms listed above, don’t delay: get
medical help straight away.

Bowel obstructions that go untreated lead to serious complications and death.
You might need to have part of your bowel removed. After having this operation you
will have what’s called short bowel syndrome. You will need to take supplements prescribed
by your doctor for the rest of your life, to make sure you get enough of the right
nutrition.

If you have had treatment for a small bowel obstruction your doctor will want to check
on you regularly, probably once a year. Bowel obstructions can come back. So you should
be aware of any unusual digestive symptoms, and get medical help if you think the
problem is happening again."

If you have a slipped disc, one of the discs in your spine has been damaged and may
be pressing on a nerve. It can be very painful, and sometimes cause other symptoms,
such as numbness or 'pins and needles' in your legs or feet.
Rarely, people get more serious symptoms, such as a feeling of weakness in both their
legs, or numbness around their buttocks and genital region. This suggests their slipped
disc is causing a serious problem, and they may need emergency surgery.

However, most people don’t need emergency treatment. You may feel you can't do the
things you usually do, but staying active may help you recover more quickly. If your
back pain doesn't go away, surgery may help.

Here are some questions you may want to ask your doctor about a slipped disc.
If your doctor thinks you may have a slipped disc


Is there a way you can be certain I have a slipped disc?


Should I have an MRI scan or a CT scan? If so, when?


Do I need to stay in bed or rest?


Are there any activities that might make it worse?


Is there anything that can help reduce the pain?


How can I avoid getting pain again?


Are there any exercises that can make my back stronger?


Should I drive?


If you've had a scan that shows you have a slipped disc


Does the disc that's damaged in my spine match the symptoms I have?


How can you be sure the slipped disc is causing my symptoms?


If your doctor suggests surgery


What is surgery likely to do for me?


What are the risks?


How long will it take for me to recover?


When will I be able to go back to work?


Which kind of surgery do you recommend?


If I don't have surgery, what other treatments are there?


What else can I do to make my back feel better?"

A slipped disc can be very painful. But in most people the pain gets better on its
own within about six weeks. If it doesn't get better there are treatments that can
help, including surgery.
You can use our information to talk to your doctor and decide which treatments are
right for you.

What treatments work?
Although people talk about a slipped disc, nothing in your spine has actually slipped
out of place. If your doctor says you have a slipped disc it means one of the discs
that sit between each of the bones in your spine has been damaged.

The outer shell of the disc has torn and the spongy inner pad, which cushions the
bones, is bulging out. It may be pressing on a nerve. This is what causes the pain.

Most people with a slipped disc get better in time, and very few go on to need surgery.
There are things you can try that may ease your pain in the meantime, such as taking
painkillers.

If your pain doesn't get better you may want to consider having surgery. This works
well for many people. But some people need a repeat operation if the pain returns.


Things you can do for yourself
If your symptoms are not too serious your doctor will probably recommend a few things
you can do to help yourself, including staying active, taking paracetamol, and using
heat treatments such as hot water bottles.

Staying active means getting on with your normal activities, including going to work,
as much as possible. Long periods of bed rest - or any inactivity - are not recommended.
You should try to avoid sitting still for long periods. Walking or swimming may help
to reduce pain and stiffness.

Whatever activities you choose to do, be careful not to do things that might make
the pain worse. Don't do any heavy lifting or any strenuous bending or twisting.

Painkillers called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (or NSAIDs for short), such
as ibuprofen, may help with the pain in your back, but they don't seem to work for
sciatica pain. People who have heart problems shouldn't take an NSAID called diclofenac.

Paracetamol may help in the short term. If you still have bad pain your doctor may
recommend painkillers that combine paracetamol with stronger drugs like codeine. You
need to be sure not to take more than the recommended dose of painkillers as too much
can be dangerous.

Some people say using ice packs or heat treatments like heat lamps or hot water bottles
can help ease some back pain. But don't put ice or strong heat directly on your skin,
as this could cause damage. Don't use heat or ice for more than 15 minutes at a time.


Physiotherapy may also help some people. Your doctor may be able to refer you to a
physiotherapist, who may be able to show you how to help strengthen your back and
stop the muscles from stiffening up too much.

Other treatments
Many other treatments have been tried for different types of back pain, including
the type of pain caused by a slipped disc.

But the evidence about how well they work is often unclear. Some of these are prescription
treatments while others are treatments that you are more likely to have to pay for.

Prescription treatments that doctors might suggest include:


injections of long-lasting anaesthetic into the spine, to numb the pain. These injections
also sometimes include drugs called corticosteroids, which help to reduce swelling



drugs that relax your muscles. These can help people with other types of back pain.
But it's not clear from research whether they work for a slipped disc. These drugs
may make you drowsy.



antidepressant drugs. Some antidepressants have been found to reduce pain.


Your doctor might also suggest that you try spinal manipulation. Having this type
of treatment from a trained therapist may ease your pain. A trained therapist can
be a physiotherapist, osteopath, or chiropractor.

The therapist uses his or her hands to move the small joints between the bones (called
vertebrae) in your spine. This may relieve pain, stiffness, and other symptoms.

If you have spinal manipulation it's important to go to someone who has experience
doing this treatment and who has been trained properly.

Serious side effects of spinal manipulation are extremely rare. But they include making
your sciatica worse, breaking a bone in your spine, or damaging your spinal nerves.


There are other treatments your doctor may suggest if your pain is severe.
Other treatments that have been tried, but about which the evidence is unclear, include:




acupuncture, where therapists put thin needles into specific points on the body, and


massage, where therapists rub your skin and muscles to try to relieve pain.


Surgery
Most people with a slipped disc don't need surgery. But some people with severe symptoms
benefit from an operation to repair the damaged disc. If the surgery stops the disc
from pressing on a nerve this should relieve the pain. But the operation doesn't work
for everyone.

Before you have an operation you need to be sure that your back pain is caused by
a damaged disc. This is done with an MRI scan. If the scan shows that your pain is
not caused by a disc, then this type of surgery won't help.

The operation to repair a slipped disc is called a discectomy. There are several types
of discectomy depending on what method your surgeon uses, but the aim of all of them
is the same.

Although this operation can work well, some people find that the pain comes back eventually
and they need a second operation.

Like all kinds of surgery, discectomy has some risks, including bleeding, infection,
and having an allergic reaction to the anaesthetic. You can discuss these risks with
your doctor before deciding whether to have surgery.

New types of surgery are being developed all the time. For example, some people may
be able to have artificial discs put into their spine to replace the damaged ones.

But the type of surgery you are offered will depend on several things. These include
the type of surgery that is likely to help you most, and the particular specialist
skills of surgeons in your area.

What will happen to me?
Pain from a slipped disc gets better without treatment for 9 out of 10 people. Most
people feel better within six weeks, but it can take longer.

Back pain from a slipped disc may come back, whether or not you have treatment. It's
important to learn how to avoid over-straining or damaging your back again. A physiotherapist
can advise you about ways to protect your back when lifting things, or when sitting
for a long time."

Although people talk about a slipped disc, nothing in your spine has actually slipped

that sit between each of the bones in your spine has been damaged.

The outer shell of the disc has torn and the spongy inner pad, which cushions the
bones, is bulging out. It may be pressing on a nerve. This is what causes the pain.

Slipped discs are often caused by strain on your lower back. Things that make slipped
discs more likely include:



being older


having a job that involves heavy lifting


having a job that involves sitting for a long time or driving for long periods


being very overweight


smoking, and


playing strenuous contact sports, such as rugby.


Slipped discs are more common in men than in women. Back problems also seem to run
in families.

What are the symptoms?
The main symptom is pain in your lower back. It might start as an ache or it might
come on suddenly as a sharp, severe pain. You may find it painful to sit, stand, or
move around.

As well as the pain in their lower back, many people with a slipped disc get pain
running down one leg. This happens when the damaged disc presses on a nerve that runs
down the leg to the feet.

The nerve is called the sciatic nerve and this type of pain is called sciatica. If this happens you may feel pain, numbness, or 'pins and needles' in your legs
or feet.

It's not always easy to diagnose a slipped disc. Your doctor will probably ask you
questions about the pain and examine you.

For example, they might ask you to raise your leg, keeping it straight, while you
lie on your back. If you get sciatica pain before the leg is two-thirds of the way
up, this suggests that you have a slipped disc.

The pain of a slipped disc usually goes away within six weeks. But if it lasts longer
your doctor may send you to see a back-pain specialist. You might need an MRI scan of your spine. A scan can tell for sure if you have a slipped disc.

You should seek medical attention straight away if you:


have bad back pain that is getting worse


get a feeling of weakness in both your legs


lose control over your bladder or bowels, or


feel numb around your buttocks and genital region.


These symptoms could mean that you have a more serious problem with your spinal cord
that may need emergency treatment.

Sleep apnoea affects your breathing at night and disturbs your sleep. During the day
you might feel drowsy and struggle to concentrate. Treatment can relieve the symptoms
for many people.

We've brought together the best research about sleep apnoea and weighed up the evidence
about how to treat it. You can use our information to talk to your doctor and decide
which treatments are best for you.

What is sleep apnoea?
There are several types of sleep apnoea. The one we cover here is a common kind called
obstructive sleep apnoea, or OSA for short.

If you have obstructive sleep apnoea there are times during the night when you stop
breathing for a few seconds. It happens because the muscles in your throat relax and
block the flow of air.

After a few seconds your brain recognises the problem and makes your body start breathing
again. You may wake up with a choking or gasping sound. This can happen several times
an hour, all night, so you can't stay in a deep sleep and get the rest you need.

What are the symptoms?
The main symptom is frequent waking during the night. You may not be aware yourself
that you're waking up briefly. It may be your partner or another family member who
notices the signs first.

You may feel drowsy during the day, find it hard to concentrate, or feel tired when
you wake up. If you have severe sleep apnoea you get a powerful urge to fall asleep
in situations where you need to be fully awake. Snoring is another common symptom.

There are many things that can upset your sleep. You should see your doctor to try
to find out what is causing your problems.

What treatments work?
Obstructive sleep apnoea won't get better on its own. So it's important to get treatment.
There are things you can try yourself that may help. For example, some doctors recommend
avoiding alcohol and, if you smoke, giving up. Sleeping on your side may also help.

Continuous positive airway pressure
The main treatment for most people with obstructive sleep apnoea is called continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). With this treatment you wear a special mask to bed. The mask is connected
to an air pump by a flexible tube. The pump blows a steady, gentle flow of air into
your nose (or nose and mouth). The flow of air helps keep your airway open.

You will be shown how to use the CPAP equipment. If you find CPAP difficult or awkward
to use you may be able to have extra support and training to help you get used to
it.

CPAP can improve your sleep and make you feel much less tired during the day, especially
if you have severe sleep apnoea. But the mask can cause side effects in some people,
including a dry mouth, sneezing, and a runny nose. You might find wearing the mask
uncomfortable.

Using a mouthpiece
People with less-severe symptoms, or who don't want to use CPAP, can try wearing a
special mouthpiece while sleeping. The mouthpiece works by pushing your lower jaw
forward to keep your airway open. It fits round your teeth and looks a bit like a
gum shield used for sport.

Mouthpieces are sometimes used to stop people snoring. Mouthpieces can help reduce
sleep apnoea symptoms, but they don't work as well as CPAP.

They can cause side effects, including dry mouth, gum irritation, or dribbling. But
these problems seem to be temporary.

Losing weight
If you're overweight your doctor is likely to advise you to try to lose weight. Losing
weight can help reduce sleep apnoea symptoms, especially in those who are very overweight
to begin with. Generally, the more weight people lose, the more their symptoms improve.
But symptoms can get worse again in people who regain weight they have lost.

Surgery
Some people with severe sleep apnoea have surgery to try to relieve their symptoms.
People with very large tonsils and adenoids sometimes get sleep apnoea. An operation
to remove their tonsils and adenoids may help. Another operation can widen your airway
by removing some tissue from the top of your throat.

Although surgery may help some people, it's not usually recommended. This is because,
for many people, sleep apnoea comes back after surgery. Also, like most kinds of surgery,
operations for sleep apnoea carry risks, including infections, bleeding, and pain.

What will happen to me?
If it's not treated sleep apnoea can affect how much you enjoy life. And if you're
sleepy during the day you may have problems doing your job. It can also affect your
driving. If you have sleep apnoea you should tell the relevant authority (for example,
in the UK this is the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency [DVLA]) and your car insurance
company.

People with severe sleep apnoea may also be more likely to get other health problems,
such as heart disease and depression. So it's important to get treatment."

Squamous cell skin cancer usually looks like a crusted lump on the skin. It can be
sore and tender and usually gets bigger over time. The lump won’t heal or go away
without treatment. But it can be cured with surgery in most people.

You can use our information to talk to your doctor about which treatments are right
for you.

What is squamous cell skin cancer?
As its name suggests, this type of skin cancer starts in the squamous cells of your skin. These cells sit in the top layer of your skin, just under the surface.
Sometimes they get damaged, usually by too much sun.

Unlike normal skin cells, these damaged cells don’t die off and get replaced by new
cells. Instead they stay on your skin and multiply.

These cells may form a lump, which may be a tumour (a squamous cell cancer). If the
tumour isn't treated it can damage the tissues nearby and spread to other parts of
your body.

Squamous cell skin cancer is not the most serious type of skin cancer (that's melanoma), but it can spread if it's not treated. To learn more about melanoma see our leaflet
on Skin cancer: melanoma.

Fair skin that burns easily is more likely than dark skin that tans easily to be damaged
in this way. And the more sun you get, the more likely you are to get this cancer.

What are the symptoms?
The main symptom of squamous cell skin cancer is having a lump on the skin that grows
and looks different from the skin around it. This type of lump:



is usually raised


is usually crusted


can be sore when you touch it, and


might bleed.


Sometimes these types of cancer grow very quickly.
Squamous cell skin cancers can vary in size from a few millimetres (slightly more
than 1/16 of an inch across) to 5 centimetres (up to 2 inches across).

They can show up anywhere on your skin. But they usually show up on parts of the body
that get the most sun, such as:



the face


lower legs, and


forearms.


If you're worried about any unusual spots or patches on your skin, see your doctor.


If the doctor thinks you may have skin cancer, he or she may remove some or all of
the spot and test it for cancer. This is called a biopsy.

Your doctor may refer you to a specialist skin doctor (called a dermatologist) or to a surgeon to have the biopsy, or for more treatment.

What treatments work?
The main treatments for squamous cell skin cancer are surgery and other treatments
aimed at destroying or removing the cancer cells.

There are several possible treatments. The one your doctor recommends will depend
on several things including:



the size of the tumour


its location on your body, and


the specialist skills of your surgeon.


Treatments for Bowen's disease (very early skin cancer)
Bowen's disease is a very early form of skin cancer. It is usually easy to treat.
It grows very slowly and is not usually serious. However, if left untreated it can
develop into more serious types of skin cancer.

There are several treatments for Bowen's disease, including:


cryotherapy. This involves a surgeon freezing away the damaged cells with liquid nitrogen



electrodesiccation and curettage. The surgeon scrapes away the damaged skin cells and the wound is then healed using
an electric current. It is usual to have three sessions of this treatment



photodynamic therapy. The surgeon applies a substance to the area of damaged skin that makes it highly
sensitive to light. When light is shone on the area, the cancer cells are killed.
You may need to have this treatment two or three times, four weeks apart



chemotherapy. Drugs that kill cancer cells are applied directly to the skin (for example, as a
cream). You may be able to do this treatment yourself at home



radiotherapy. Your doctor may suggest this if other treatments are not suitable for you. This
treatment uses powerful x-rays to kill cancer cells.



All of these treatments seem to work well. But they are all likely to lead to some
scarring and changes in skin colour around the affected area.

Treatments for invasive squamous cell skin cancer
Squamous cell skin cancer that has spread beyond the very top layer of skin is called
invasive. The usual treatment is surgery to remove the cancer cells (the tumour).

If your tumour is small (less than 2 centimetres [4/5 of an inch] wide) and in an
area that is highly visible, such as on or near your face, you may be able to have
a type of surgery called Mohs micrographic surgery.

This operation allows the surgeon to remove less tissue than they usually would, which
should leave a smaller scar.

For larger tumours (more than 2 centimetres wide), and for tumours in areas that are
not so visible, standard surgery is recommended. If you have a large tumour you may
be referred to a cancer specialist (called an oncologist) for radiotherapy. This is to kill off any cancer cells left behind after surgery.

You'll probably have radiotherapy treatments a few times a week for several weeks.
Treatments usually take about 30 minutes.

You won't feel anything during this treatment, but you may get dry and red skin, a
rash, and blisters. Afterwards the patch of skin that’s been treated may not be able
to sweat, or it may be flaky and a different colour from the skin around it.

During the operation to remove your skin cancer, your doctor will cut out the tumour
and also some of the healthy-looking skin around it. This is called taking a margin.
The doctor takes away some of the skin from around the cancer to make sure that all
the cancer cells are gone.

Doctors usually take out at least 4 millimetres (1/6 of an inch) of healthy tissue
from around the cancer.

After your cancer is removed, your doctor will close your wound with stitches if needed.
This step is usually very simple, and you'll be left with just a small scar after
your stitches are gone.

If the wound is bigger, you may need to have a piece of skin taken from another part
of your body stitched over it. This is called a skin graft.

Treatments for metastatic squamous cell skin cancer (cancer that has spread)
Tumours can sometimes spread to nearby nerves or to other tissues called lymph nodes. This type of tumour is called metastatic. If you have this type of squamous cell
skin cancer you will be referred to an oncologist.

The usual treatment is surgery to remove the tumour and the affected lymph nodes.
You will then need to have radiotherapy and perhaps chemotherapy. As with invasive
tumours, you may be able to have Mohs micrographic surgery if your tumour is small
or in a highly visible area.

Things you can do for yourself
If you have had squamous cell skin cancer, protecting your skin when you go outdoors
can reduce your chance of getting it again.

This doesn't just mean using a sun block, but also:


covering up


staying in the shade as much as possible, and


wearing a hat and sunglasses.


If you have had squamous cell skin cancer it is recommended that you stay out of the
sun as much as possible, especially during the middle part of the day when the sun
is at its strongest.

You should use a sunscreen that has a sun protection factor (or SPF) of at least 15.
It’s important that you:



apply sunscreen correctly and evenly and use plenty of it


reapply it every 60 minutes and after you've been in water, and


don't stay in the sun longer just because you're using sunscreen. You can still get
burned.



Screening
Doctors recommend that people thought to have an increased chance of skin cancer should
have a total-body skin examination every year. This is done by a doctor or skin specialist
(dermatologist). People aged over 50 have an increased chance of skin cancer.

If you have had skin cancer before you should have an examination every six months.
If your immune system is weakened you should be examined even more often. Finding
new tumours when they are still small means that they are easier to treat.

If any of these apply to you, talk to your doctor about arranging a skin examination.
What will happen to me?
Most people are cured completely after surgery. But even though squamous cell is not
the most serious type of skin cancer, it can sometimes spread to other parts of the
body.

If this happens, the cancer is harder to cure. As with all cancers, the earlier your
skin cancer is diagnosed and treated, the better your chance of a cure.

Squamous cell skin cancer doesn't usually come back. But if it does you will need
more treatment."

Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that usually starts within a mole or a dark spot
on your skin. If you find it early before it spreads, a simple operation to remove
it works well and usually leads to a cure.

Here, we look at how melanoma develops and its warning signs. To read about how doctors
diagnose and treat melanoma, see our leaflet Skin cancer (melanoma): how is it diagnosed and treated?

What is melanoma?
Melanoma is a form of cancer that starts in skin cells called melanocytes. Melanocytes
make the dark pigment called melanin that makes your skin darker when you’ve been
in the sun.

It’s important to find a melanoma early on. If you don’t have a melanoma treated quickly,
it could grow deeper into your skin and spread to other parts of your body.

Melanoma is the most serious type of skin cancer. It affects young people more often
than older people. Older people are more likely to get a type of skin cancer called
squamous cell cancer. To learn more, see our leaflet Skin cancer (squamous cell).

Doctors don’t know exactly what causes melanoma. But too much exposure to ultraviolet
(UV) rays from the sun seems to trigger changes to melanocyte cells. These changes
may make the cells grow in an abnormal way and turn cancerous. We don’t know why some
moles turn cancerous while others don’t.

Some people are more likely than others to get melanoma. Having lots of moles (more
than 50), especially ones with jagged edges, makes it more likely. Other things that
increase your chance of getting this type of cancer include having relatives who have
had melanoma, having had bad sunburn as a child, and having freckles, fair skin and
hair, and blue or green eyes.

Going to tanning booths or using a sun lamp can also increase your risk, as this also
exposes your skin to UV rays.

What are the warning signs?
The two main warning signs of melanoma are changes in a mole that you already have,
or a new mole or dark spot appearing on your skin. See your doctor if you find a mole
that has changed in shape, size or colour, or that feels different (rougher or scalier
than before), hurts, itches, or bleeds.

There's an easy way to remember what to look for. Just think of ABCDE.

A stands for asymmetry. This means that the mole isn't round and even, like a circle. If you drew a line
through the middle of the mole, the two sides would not match.

B stands for border. A normal mole has a smooth border. The moles you need to watch out for are the ones
with jagged edges or notches in the edges.

C stands for colour. If your mole has different shades of colour, you should get it checked out. Possible
colours include black, tan, red, blue, and white.

D stands for diameter, which is the distance from one side of the mole to the other. Look out for moles
that are wider than a pencil eraser. But remember: the smaller a melanoma is when
you find it, the better your chances of getting rid of it.

E stands for evolution. This means that the mole has changed - for example, its shape, size or colour has
changed, or it feels different."

Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that usually starts within a mole or a dark spot

it works well and usually leads to a cure.

This information is about treating melanoma that has not spread to other parts of
the body (called non-metastatic melanoma). You can use our information to talk to your doctor and decide what treatments are
best for you.

To learn more about melanoma and its warning signs, see the leaflet Skin cancer (melanoma): what is it?
How is melanoma diagnosed?
If your doctor thinks you could have a melanoma you will probably be referred to a
specialist skin doctor, called a dermatologist. The dermatologist will examine your skin, possibly with a special magnifying tool
called a dermatoscope.

If the dermatologist thinks you may have a melanoma, he or she will do a biopsy.



A biopsy usually involves removing all of the mole, along with a small amount of normal-looking
tissue around it, to be tested for cancer.





But sometimes a dermatologist will remove only part of the mole for testing: for example,
if the mole is large and the dermatologist wants to be sure it is cancer before completely
removing it.



You'll have a local anaesthetic to numb the area of the biopsy so you won't feel any
pain.



The removed tissue will be checked by a doctor called a pathologist to see if it is cancer. If it is, the pathologist will also look at how thick it
is. The thickness is measured by how far down into your skin the melanoma grows.

If your melanoma is very thin and was completely removed during the biopsy, you may
not need any further treatment. But thicker melanomas usually require additional surgery,
to be certain that all of the cancer cells are removed.

How is melanoma treated?
Standard surgery
You'll have a local anaesthetic that will numb the area around the melanoma so you
won't feel any pain. The doctor will then cut out the melanoma (if it hasn't already
been removed in the biopsy) and some of the normal-looking skin around it.

Taking out the skin from around the melanoma is called taking a margin. The doctor does this to make sure that all the cancer cells are gone. This means
there’s less chance that the melanoma will come back.

The amount of skin that's taken away depends on how thick your melanoma is.


If you have a very thin melanoma that hasn't grown below the top layer of the skin (called melanoma in situ), you will probably have about half a centimetre of skin removed from around the
melanoma.



If you have a thin melanoma (less than 1 millimetre thick) you will probably have about 1 centimetre of skin
removed from around the melanoma.



If you have an intermediate-thickness melanoma (1 to 4 millimetres thick) you will probably have 1 to 2 centimetres of skin removed
from around the melanoma.



If you have a thick melanoma (more than 4 millimetres thick) you will probably have 2 centimetres of skin removed
from around the melanoma.



After the surgery your doctor will close the wound, probably with stitches. You'll
be left with a scar after your stitches are gone. If the wound is bigger you may need
to have a piece of skin taken from another part of your body and placed over the wound
to help it heal.

A pathologist will examine the tissue removed during the surgery to check whether
the edges of the tissue contain no cancer cells (this is called a clear margin). This
suggests that all of the cancer has been removed.

Surgery with less scarring
Doctors sometimes recommend surgery that limits how much tissue they need to remove
around the melanoma. This can reduce scarring, which may be important to you if the
melanoma is on your face, neck, or another visible part of your body.

This type of surgery is usually an option only for people who have a very thin melanoma
(melanoma in situ). It's called Mohs micrographic surgery. It's done like this:



After the main part of the melanoma has been removed, the doctor takes out a very
thin layer of skin from around it. This layer of skin is then checked for cancer cells
using a microscope.



If there are cancer cells, the doctor takes out another very thin layer of skin from
where the cancer cells were found and this is checked under the microscope. When only
normal cells are found, the operation stops.



This type of surgery is done in one appointment. However, some research suggests it
may not be as good as other types of surgery at catching all of the cancer cells and
preventing the melanoma from coming back.

Alternatives to surgery
Some people have other treatments instead of surgery, such as radiotherapy or treatments that they put on their skin (one is called imiquimod).

But these treatments don't work as well as surgery, as they don't provide a way to
check whether all the cancer cells are gone after treatment.

These treatments are usually only an option if someone has a very thin cancer (melanoma
in situ).

Further treatments
If your doctor thinks your cancer may have spread you will need further tests. Your
doctor will check the lymph nodes (small glands) near your melanoma. If these seem
swollen or hard, the cancer may have spread to them.

Your doctor may advise you to have surgery to remove the lymph nodes. The nodes will then be checked for cancer by a pathologist.

If your lymph nodes seem normal, your doctor may not want to remove them straight
away. Instead you may be offered a sentinel node biopsy.
This test finds the lymph node (or sometimes nodes) that your melanoma would drain
into first (called the sentinel node). This node is then removed and tested for cancer
cells.

If there are no cancer cells in the sentinel node then it is unlikely that there will
be cancer cells in other lymph nodes. If there are cancer cells in the sentinel node
you may need surgery to remove all the nodes in the area.

After surgery you may be referred to a cancer specialist (an oncologist). If the cancer has spread you may need treatment with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or drugs that boost your immune system.

Things you can do to help yourself
If you've had a melanoma, you will have regular skin checks with a dermatologist to
try to catch any new cancers early on.

But it's important that you also check your own skin regularly, ideally using a full-length
mirror as well as a hand mirror for areas that are hard to see. Your spouse or partner
can help.

You should become familiar with the moles on your body so you can spot any changes,
including any new moles that appear. See your doctor if you notice anything unusual.

Although doctors are not exactly sure what causes melanoma, the sun plays a big part.
So it's a good idea to stay out of the sun, especially in the middle of the day when
UV rays are strongest. This means staying indoors or in the shade as much as possible.


If you are in the sun, consider covering up any exposed skin with clothing made of
a tightly woven fabric, and wearing a hat and sunglasses with UV protection.

If you have to be outside with exposed skin, make sure you wear a sunscreen with a
sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30, even on cloudy days.



The sunscreen should protect against two kinds of UV light: UVA and UVB.


Apply the sunscreen 20 minutes before going outdoors, and reapply it at least every
two hours - or more frequently if you’ve been in water or sweating. Don't skimp on
the sunscreen: always apply a generous amount.



Try not to stay in the sun longer just because you're using sunscreen. If you use
sunscreen to stay in the sun longer, you might actually increase your chances of getting
melanoma.



You should also avoid other sources of UV light, such as tanning beds and sun lamps.


What to expect in the future
If you find a melanoma early there’s a good chance that you’ll be cured after surgery.
In people whose melanoma has not spread, more than 99 in 100 are still alive five
years after treatment.

In people whose cancer has spread to the lymph nodes, about 70 in 100 are still alive
five years later.

Note: these numbers don't mean that people are only expected to live for five years
after treatment. It's just that studies longer than five years are hard to do, because
it's hard to keep track of people for longer periods.

No one can say for certain whether your melanoma will come back and cause problems
in the future. But, in general, the smaller and thinner your melanoma is when you
have surgery, the less likely it is to come back."

Sinusitis can be very painful but it usually clears up on its own. If your symptoms
bother you a lot there are treatments that might help.

You can use our information to talk to your doctor or pharmacist and decide which
treatments are best for you.

What is sinusitis?
Sinuses are small spaces in your skull that are filled with air. You have them in
your cheek bones, behind and between your eyes, and in your forehead. They make mucus,
which normally drains through small openings into the nose.

If you have sinusitis your sinuses are inflamed (swollen), so the mucus can't drain
away. The sinuses in your cheeks are most often affected.

People often get sinusitis after they've had a viral infection such as a cold or the
flu. Hay fever and other allergies can also cause sinusitis.

Sinusitis that lasts a long time is called chronic sinusitis.

Short attacks that last for four weeks or less are called acute sinusitis. Here, we look at treatments for acute sinusitis, which is the most common type

What are the symptoms?
Sinusitis can be very painful. The symptoms often start just as you think you're getting
better from an infection. If your nose feels blocked you may think you have a cold,
but you may have acute sinusitis.

With sinusitis you may get some of these symptoms as well as a blocked nose:


pain in your forehead, upper jaw, teeth, cheeks, or around your eyes


loss of your sense of smell


a headache that is worse when you lean forward (it might start when you get up in
the morning)



toothache or pain when you eat


large amounts of green or yellow mucus in your nose


feeling generally unwell


a sore throat, which is caused by the mucus dripping down from your nose into your
throat.



Your doctor will usually be able to tell if you have sinusitis by your symptoms. If
your sinusitis is very bad, or if it keeps coming back, you may need to see a specialist
or have tests such as CT (computerised tomography) scan.

What treatments work?
Sinusitis usually gets better on its own, but there are treatments that can help relieve
the symptoms.

Simple painkillers like paracetamol or ibuprofen, or tablets that combine paracetamol
with codeine, help ease the pain for many people. But if your symptoms are very bad
it's best to see your doctor.

Steroid nasal sprays
Steroid nasal sprays are used to reduce inflammation (swelling) in the nose. The full
name for these steroids is corticosteroids. They are not the same as the anabolic
steroids used by some bodybuilders and athletes.

Some steroid nasal sprays are available over the counter. For others you'll need a
prescription from your doctor. There are several different steroid sprays.

You breathe these sprays in through your nose once or twice a day. You'll probably
need to use them for several weeks.

These sprays can cause side effects. For example, some people who use a steroid nasal
spray get a headache or a nosebleed.

Decongestants
These are available from pharmacies without a prescription. But the research on how
well they work for sinusitis isn't very clear.

Decongestants come as tablets, nasal sprays, and drops. The idea is that they relieve
a blocked nose so you can breathe more easily.

These medicines are not suitable for some people. If you have heart disease, diabetes,
or a thyroid condition, check with your doctor before using a decongestant.

You should not use decongestant nasal sprays for longer than a week. After that they
can cause 'rebound congestion'. This means you get a blocked nose again after you
stop taking them.

Antibiotics
Antibiotics are medicines that treat bacterial infections. They are not often used
for sinusitis because most sinusitis is caused by viruses, not by bacteria.

If you have sinusitis caused by bacteria then antibiotics might help clear up your
symptoms more quickly. But most people with bacterial sinusitis get better without
antibiotics.

Other treatments
Some people inhale steam to help relieve blocked sinuses, but there is a danger of
scalding.

Another option is rinsing your nose with salt water spray. It might help to reduce swelling
and make mucus thinner.

What will happen to me?
About two-thirds of people with acute sinusitis get better without having any treatment
from their doctor, usually within five to 10 days. But some people get repeat attacks.

There's also a chance that after one attack you will get chronic sinusitis (sinusitis
that lasts more than three months). If this happens to you, see your doctor. You may
need to see a specialist doctor for tests and treatment.

In rare cases sinusitis can cause serious problems that affect the brain and eyes.
Always see a doctor straight away if:



you have a very bad headache or a stiff neck


bright light causes you pain


you have double vision


you have swelling around the eyes


you have a high fever, or


you feel confused or unusually drowsy."

People who have sickle cell disease are born with it. It can cause pain, increase
the chance of infections (particularly in children) and sometimes lead to serious
health problems.

But many people with sickle cell disease feel well a lot of the time.
Below we look at treatments to help people cope with the problems caused by sickle
cell disease. To learn more about what happens in sickle cell disease, see the leaflet
Sickle cell disease: what is it?

Preventing infections in children
In children under 5 years old, regular doses of the antibiotic penicillin can help
reduce infections. Penicillin doesn't normally cause serious side effects, but some
children are allergic to it. Children allergic to penicillin are given a different
antibiotic.

Vaccines can also help prevent infections. Your doctor might suggest a vaccine to
protect your child from illnesses such as pneumonia and meningitis.

These vaccines don't usually have serious side effects, but they can cause a mild
fever for a few hours after they are given.

Treatments for pain
A drug called hydroxyurea (also called hydroxycarbamide) can reduce the number of
painful attacks in adults. And it can reduce the amount of time children with sickle
cell pain need to spend in hospital.

Hydroxyurea can have side effects in some people, including:


a drop in white blood cells (cells that fight infection)


hair loss


a rash, and


an upset stomach.


If you're travelling in a country where malaria is common your doctor may recommend
anti-malaria drugs. That's because malaria can trigger sickle cell pain.

If you get mild pain your doctor may suggest an over-the-counter painkiller such as
paracetamol or ibuprofen.

Aspirin should not be given to children under 16.

For moderate pain your doctor may give you or your child a weak opioid medicine such
as codeine. But codeine should not be given to children aged 12 and younger.

Your doctor might also prescribe a strong non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).
For severe pain your doctor may recommend a strong opioid painkiller, such as morphine.
You'll have to go to hospital to be given morphine. You may also be given extra fluids
from a drip (also called intravenous infusion or IV) and oxygen to breathe in through
a mask.

Doctors often prescribe a combination of painkillers. All painkillers can have side
effects. Ask your doctor to explain the possible side effects.

Other treatments
If you become seriously ill because of sickle cell disease you may need a blood transfusion.
A transfusion can help with problems linked to sickle cell disease, such as severe
anaemia, lung problems, and strokes (where a blood vessel in your brain gets blocked).

Most people with sickle cell disease will need a blood transfusion at some point.


Regular blood transfusions can prevent strokes in children who are at risk. A brain
scan called a transcranial doppler (TCD) ultrasound can find out if your child is
at risk of having a stroke.

A bone marrow transplant can sometimes cure sickle cell disease, but it isn't used
often. This is because it isn't suitable for everyone. For example, there's a risk
of serious side effects, including death. And few people have a suitable donor."

Sickle cell disease is a condition that some people are born with. It can cause pain
and serious health problems, but many people with sickle cell disease feel well a
lot of the time.

What is sickle cell disease?
Sickle cell disease is a condition that affects your blood. It's sometimes called
sickle cell anaemia.

If you have this condition the red cells in your blood, which are usually disc shaped,
turn into a sickle shape. This stops your blood from carrying oxygen as well as it
should.

Sickle cells can't travel in your bloodstream as easily as ordinary red blood cells.
They sometimes get stuck in your small blood vessels. This can stop blood reaching
parts of your body, which can cause pain.

Sickle cell disease is most common among people whose families come from Africa. But
people from a Mediterranean, Caribbean, Middle Eastern, or Asian background also can
be affected.

Sickle cell disease is caused by a faulty gene. A child may be born with sickle cell
disease if both their parents carry the faulty gene. It's possible to carry the sickle
cell gene without having sickle cell disease.

You can have a blood test to find out if you have sickle cell disease or if you carry
the gene. Most babies have this test soon after they're born.

What are the symptoms?
Pain is the most common symptom of sickle cell disease. Almost everyone with sickle
cell disease gets pain at some point, but for some people it doesn't happen very often.

There are several other symptoms:


Because sickle cell disease stops your blood carrying oxygen properly you may get
tired or breathless easily.



You may be more likely to catch infections, especially when you're young.


You might sometimes get swollen hands or feet.


What can I do to help myself?
There are several things you can do to help yourself.
Doctors may recommend that you avoid stress, drink plenty of fluids, and make sure
you get enough rest.

Some people find that very hot or cold temperatures bring on attacks of sickle cell
pain. So avoiding extreme temperatures might help.

Moderate exercise can be good for you, but very strenuous exercise might bring on
an attack of sickle cell pain.

What will happen to me?
Everyone with sickle cell disease should have what's called 'genetic counselling'.
This is because people with sickle cell disease may pass on the condition if they
have children, through their genes.

So people with sickle cell disease who are thinking about having children should be
given information and support by a trained counsellor.

Many people cope well with sickle cell disease and live full lives. Treatments can
help with sickle cell pain and also help prevent problems such as infections.

But it is possible to get episodes of severe pain and other serious health problems.
It's important to know about the problems you could get, and act straight away if
you or your child gets ill.

To read about treatments for pain and other problems caused by sickle cell disease,
see the leaflet Sickle cell disease: what treatments work?

Talk to your doctor about warning signs you need to watch out for. Signs that you
or your child need medical help include:



a fever


pain that doesn't go away if you take ordinary painkillers


pain in your abdomen that lasts a long time


chest pain


difficulty breathing


trouble speaking


changes in your vision


weakness, pain, or swelling in your hands or feet


headaches that don't go away.


Men who get an erection that doesn't go away also need to see a doctor.
And some types of contraception are not suitable for women with sickle cell disease.
Talk to your doctor about which type of contraception is best and safest for you.

Other longer-term problems related to sickle cell disease can include leg ulcers and
gallstones.

Where to get more help
It might help to talk to people who've had experiences similar to yours. For example,
in the UK you can get information and support from the Sickle Cell Society (sicklecellsociety.org)."

People usually need a shoulder injection to help with joint problems like arthritis,
or to have fluid removed from around the shoulder for testing.

Here, we look at what happens during this short procedure, including whether it will
hurt, how it might help, and what the risks are. You can use our information to talk
with your doctor about this procedure.

Why might I need a shoulder injection?
Anti-inflammatory injections
Conditions such as osteoarthritis can cause painful inflammation (swelling) and stiffness
in joints including the shoulder.

Exercise and anti-inflammatory pills are often enough to control these symptoms. But
if you have severe symptoms your doctor might recommend an injection of corticosteroids in your shoulder.

Corticosteroids are powerful anti-inflammatories. This means that they reduce swelling
and pain.

You might already have been prescribed corticosteroids as pills. But injecting them
directly into where they are needed can sometimes offer better relief for severe symptoms.

Taking fluid for testing
Having fluid taken with a needle is called aspiration. Your doctor might recommend it if you have pain and swelling in your shoulder that
could have been caused by:



an infection in that area, or




a condition that can cause long-term pain and swelling in the joints.


The fluid can then be tested, which helps your doctor to make an accurate diagnosis
and recommend the best treatment for you.

Conditions for which you might need to have fluid taken in this way include:


septic arthritis




gout




osteoarthritis




ankylosing spondylitis




rheumatoid arthritis, and




bursitis.


What will happen?
Whether you are having an injection of medication or having fluid taken for testing,
the procedure will feel the same.

The doctor will gently feel around your shoulder to find the right place for the needle.
He or she will then:



mark with a pen where the needle should go in




clean the area with an antiseptic wipe




insert the needle




either inject the medication you need, or take some fluid into the syringe. This might
take a minute or so





withdraw the needle, and




apply a small dressing or plaster over the place where the needle went in.


What are the risks?
Although it’s a short procedure, a shoulder injection can be a bit painful at the
time. And corticosteroid injections can cause dull pain for several hours afterwards.


Other possible complications from this procedure include:


bleeding




infection




damage to joints if you have injections frequently, and




damage to tendons.


These problems are rare, but they do sometimes happen. Your doctor should explain
all the possible complications to you before you have the procedure.

What can I expect afterwards?
If your injection has been to test the fluid in your shoulder, your doctor should
arrange a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. The follow-up appointment
is also a chance for the doctor to check on any complications that might have been
caused by the procedure. If you have had a corticosteroid injection, your doctor should
tell you how long the injection will take to work, and how long the painkilling effects
should last.

These injections usually take a few days to start working, and the effects last from
a few weeks to a few months, depending on the medication used. Your doctor will be
able to tell you more."

Anyone who has had chickenpox can get shingles in later life. Shingles can be very
painful but there are good treatments that can shorten an attack and help prevent
long-lasting problems. There are also vaccines to help prevent shingles.

What treatments work to prevent shingles?
Two vaccines are available to help protect older people from getting shingles. The
one you are offered might depend on what is available and preferred by your health
authority.



Zostavax is a vaccine given as a single injection. It is suitable for most people, but
not for pregnant women, people who have problems that affect their immune system,
and children.



Shingrix is given as two injections, a few months apart. It seems to be more effective
than Zostavax, especially in older people. But it seems more likely to cause irritation
after you have the injection.



Both vaccines reduce your chance of getting shingles. If you do get shingles after
having the vaccine, the vaccine can help:



make the symptoms less severe, and


reduce the chance of long-term pain.


What treatments work to treat shingles?
Shingles is caused by the same virus that causes chickenpox. It’s called the varicella
zoster virus.

Once you’ve had chickenpox the virus lives in your nerve cells. Usually it stays in
your nerve cells for many years and doesn’t cause any problems. Your immune system
keeps it in check.

But as you get older, or if your immune system is weak, the virus may ‘wake up’ and
start reproducing in your nerve cells. The virus then travels to the nerve endings
in your skin. This can cause a painful rash and make you feel ill.

Treatment during an attack of shingles can help ease your symptoms and reduce your
chances of getting more serious problems, such as long-lasting pain. If you do get
long-lasting pain there are treatments that can help.

Things you can do for yourself
Shingles can be very uncomfortable. There are some things you can try to make yourself
feel better.



Take over-the-counter painkillers, like paracetamol. You can also use calamine lotion
to soothe itching and pain.



Wear loose clothing that is unlikely to irritate your skin.


Keep the rash clean and dry.


Protect the rash with a loose, non-stick, sterile dressing.


Cool the rash by using an ice pack or taking a cool bath.


If you still have pain despite taking over-the-counter painkillers, ask your pharmacist
or doctor for help. They may be able to recommend a stronger painkiller.

Treatments for a shingles attack
Taking antiviral tablets when you have an attack of shingles means your pain is likely to go away sooner.
Your pain may also be milder and the rash may clear up more quickly. Antivirals work
by stopping the virus from reproducing.

If you have the shingles rash on your face, taking antiviral tablets can reduce your
chances of getting eye problems from shingles.

Like all medications, antivirals can cause side effects in some people. These can
include a headache or feeling sick. But these side effects are not usually serious.

If you get long-lasting pain
Lasting pain after shingles is called post-herpetic neuralgia. It continues after
your rash has cleared up, sometimes for months or longer. Treatments can help you
feel better.

If your pain is mild, taking over-the-counter painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen, can help.
Some people also find that using a cream containing the chilli-pepper extract capsaicin
helps their pain.

Your doctor might also recommend taking a weak opioid painkiller, such as codeine.
If your pain is more severe your doctor might prescribe a stronger opioid medicine, such as tramadol. But your
doctor will probably prescribe a low dose, as tramadol can be addictive. If you are
concerned about becoming addicted to opioid painkillers, talk to your doctor.

Tramadol can also cause other side effects, including constipation, drowsiness, and
nausea.

If strong painkillers don't help enough, your doctor may prescribe a certain type
of antidepressant, called a trycyclic. These drugs are usually used to treat depression.
But at a low dose they can help reduce nerve pain.

You may need to take a tricyclic for several weeks before it starts to work. Possible
side effects of tricyclics can include feeling tired, having stomach pain, and feeling
restless.

Another option for severe pain is a drug called an anticonvulsant. These drugs are
usually used to treat epilepsy but they can also help with nerve pain.

Side effects of anticonvulsants can include feeling dizzy, feeling sleepy, putting
on weight, and getting constipated.

The shingles vaccine is designed to protect against painful symptoms caused by the
same virus that causes chickenpox.

This virus can 'wake up' after being inactive in the body for many years. These problems
usually affect older people.

What is shingles (herpes zoster)?
Shingles is caused by a virus called varicella zoster. It is the same virus that causes chickenpox. The medical name for shingles is herpes zoster.

Chickenpox is a common infection in children. It causes a fever and a rash but usually
clears up by itself without causing serious problems.

But the chickenpox virus can remain inactive or 'dormant' in the body for many years
after the symptoms have gone. This means that the virus is still there, but it isn’t
spreading or doing any harm. It’s as if it’s asleep.

In some older people, though, the virus can reactivate or 'wake up'. If this happens
it can cause symptoms similar to chickenpox, but more severe.

Symptoms of shingles include:



feeling generally unwell


fatigue (tiredness)


headache


pain, burning, tingling, or numbness on an area of skin, usually on the torso (chest,
back, and abdomen)



a rash on the affected area a few days after the pain starts. This rash will develop
small blisters. The rash will probably be on one side of your body. Many people get
it around their waist, but it can occur anywhere.



Even with treatment, the symptoms usually last between two and four weeks, but some
people develop long-lasting pain. Early treatment can help prevent long-term problems.

Some people have a rash involving an eye, which can cause vision damage if not treated quickly.

Shingles can sometimes be fatal, but this is rare.
For more information, see our leaflets: Shingles: what is it? and Shingles: What treatments work?
Who needs the shingles vaccination?
Shingles mainly affects older people, so people tend to be offered this vaccination
as they get older. Vaccination schedules vary between countries, so the age at which
people are offered the vaccination will depend on where you live.

For example, in the UK, people are offered the vaccine starting at 70 years old, and you can have it up to the age of 79 years old. It is not offered to people after that, as it doesn’t work very well in those aged
over 80.

Is there anyone who shouldn’t have the vaccine?
You should not have the vaccine if you are allergic to any of its ingredients. Tell the medical staff giving you the vaccine about any
allergies you have.

You should also not have the vaccine if you are pregnant or think that you might be.

Is it safe?
There have been no major safety problems with the shingles vaccine over many years
of use.

But, like all vaccines, it can cause side effects in some people. These include:


headache, and


pain, itching, redness, warmth, and bruising where the injection was given (called
the injection site).



Any side effects should only last a few days. If they last any longer, talk to your
doctor.

Very rarely, the type of vaccine used in the UK can actually cause chickenpox. In some countries, including the US, a different shingles vaccine is often used,
which does not cause this side effect.

Extremely rarely, the shingles vaccine can cause an extreme allergic reaction. The medical staff giving the vaccine will have been trained in how to deal with
an allergic reaction.

How is the vaccination given?
The shingles vaccine is given as an injection into the upper arm.
How well does the vaccine work?
The shingles vaccine that’s usually used in the UK doesn’t give complete protection
to everyone. But it seems to reduce the number of people getting shingles by about
two thirds.

And if you do get shingles after having the vaccine, your symptoms are likely to be
much less severe than if you hadn’t been vaccinated.

The vaccine seems to offer this kind of protection for about five years. But a newer
type of vaccine, called an 'inactivated vaccine', seems to offer better protection."

Anyone who has had chickenpox is at risk of getting shingles in later life. Shingles
can be very painful, but there are good treatments that may shorten an attack and
help prevent long-lasting problems. There is also a vaccine to help prevent shingles.

What is shingles?
Shingles is caused by the same virus that causes chickenpox. It’s called the varicella-zoster
virus. Once you’ve had chickenpox, the virus lives in your nerve cells. Usually, it
stays in your nerve cells for many years and doesn’t cause any problems. Your immune

But as you get older, or if your immune system is weak, the virus may ‘wake up’ and
start reproducing in your nerve cells. The virus travels to the nerve endings in your
skin. This can cause a painful rash and make you feel ill.

You can’t catch shingles from someone else who has shingles, or from someone who has
chickenpox. You can only get shingles if you’ve already had chickenpox. However, if
you have shingles, you should avoid close contact with people who haven't had chickenpox
(or the chickenpox vaccine), as you can pass the virus to them. They may then get
chickenpox.

What are the symptoms?
These are the most common symptoms of shingles.


You may feel unwell, tired, and have a headache.


A patch of your skin will probably feel tingly and painful, and may itch. The pain
may feel burning, stabbing, or throbbing. It may be constant or come and go. Your
skin may feel worse if you touch it.



After two or three days, you will get a rash on the affected area. This rash will
develop small blisters. The rash will probably be on one side of your body. Many people
get it on their waist area, although it can occur anywhere on the body.



If you have symptoms of shingles, it's important to see your doctor quickly. That's
because treatment works best if you start taking it within three days of getting the
rash. Treatment can also lower your chances of getting more serious problems from
shingles, such as long-lasting pain (called post-herpetic neuralgia).

It’s particularly important to see a doctor quickly if you have a shingles rash near
your eye. If your eye is affected by your shingles attack, your doctor will recommend
you see an eye specialist. Your eye could be damaged by the virus if you don’t have
the right treatment.

Doctors can usually diagnose shingles from looking at the rash and asking you about
your symptoms and whether you've had chickenpox. You probably won’t need any tests.


What will happen to me?
The rash from shingles usually lasts about two to four weeks. The tiny blisters crust
over and heal up. Sometimes they leave a scar or change the colour of the skin.

Long-lasting pain after shingles (post-herpetic neuralgia) is uncommon in younger
people, but the risk increases with age. By age 60, around 4 in 10 people who have
shingles get post-herpetic neuralgia. This can make people feel very low, but treatments
can help. The pain usually goes away within six months, but some people have it for
longer.

https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/3000289/Sexual%20dysfunction%20in%20women,Sexual dysfunction in women,"Sexual dysfunction in women Last published: Sep 30, 2022
A woman is said to have sexual dysfunction if she regularly struggles to feel sexual
desire, to respond sexually to her partner, or to achieve orgasm, over many months.

These symptoms are not usually caused by anything physical, and they can often be
traced to mental-health issues, especially depression.

If you feel that you are affected by sexual dysfunction, you can use our information
to talk to your doctor about the best ways to approach the problem. It often helps
when both partners talk to their doctor together.

What is sexual dysfunction in women?
Sexual dysfunction in women is a broad term that covers several specific problems.
For example, you may read about, or hear your doctor talk about:



Sexual interest/arousal disorder (SIAD), where someone has had no interest in sex or no sexual arousal for at least six months,
and



Female orgasmic disorder (FOD), where there is a marked reduction in the ability to reach orgasm, or reduced intensity
of orgasm.



Some conditions can cause sex to be painful. For example, you may have heard terms
such as vaginismus or dyspareunia. Another condition, called persistent genital arousal disorder (PGAD), causes sudden, random, and unwanted sensations in the genitals.

These conditions, which we don’t cover here, have mainly physical causes. The issues we look at in this leaflet are largely linked to mental health.

Many women go through spells of reduced sexual interest: for example, during or just
after pregnancy, or when you are stressed or anxious - or for no reason that you can
pin down. But these spells don’t usually last.

But some women find that their reduced interest in sex doesn’t go away. If this happens
to you, you may want to talk to your doctor. A doctor may say that you've got sexual
dysfunction if your symptoms:



Have lasted at least six months


Affect your sexual activity most of the time, and


Are causing you distress.


Sexual dysfunction that fits these descriptions seems to affect about 5 in every 100
women at some time in their lives.

What causes sexual dysfunction?
Sexual dysfuncion is not likely to be caused by anything physical. It’s true that
some physical factors, such as some medicines, can affect your sex drive. But arousal
and desire are usually linked to your mental wellbeing.

Things that can cause you to have reduced sexual desire include:


Depression, and other mental health issues such as low self-esteem and anxiety


Personal issues that may or may not involve your partner


Cultural issues and pressures


Experiences from your teenage years, such as neglect, abuse, or a difficult relationship
with a parent or guardian



Problems in your relationship, and


Your partner having sexual problems.


Some medicines and recreational drugs can also cause reduced sexual desire and arousal. These include:



Antidepressants, which are used to treat depression and other mental health conditions


Anticonvulsants, which are used to treat conditions that involve seizures and sudden
muscle movements



Antipsychotics, which are used to treat conditions that involve psychosis (seeing
and hearing things that aren’t real)



Some hormone treatments used to treat women who have had some types of cancer


Combined contraceptives containing certain hormones


Opioid painkillers


Alcohol, and


Cocaine.


What are the symptoms?
If you see your doctor about problems with sexual arousal, they will need to ask you
a lot of questions to help them to understand your issues. This helps to guide what
kind of treatment may help the most.

These questions are likely to be personal and intimate, and you may feel uncomfortable
answering some of them, especially at first.

But your doctor should be respectful and should try to make you feel as comfortable
as possible. Remember, they will probably have helped many other women with similar
problems before.

Your doctor will probably start by asking you:


About your past and present mental health


About your past and present sex life


About your self image - how you feel about yourself


About any past life experiences that you feel may be important


If you find sex painful


How long you feel that you have had sexual problems


Whether your problems happen with your partner, or when you are alone, or both


About any past or present medical conditions, and


About any medicines you are taking.


The symptoms you describe to your doctor may well fit one of two well recognised types
of sexual problem.

The symptoms of sexual interest/arousal disorder (SIAD) include:



Having no interest, or less interest than you used to, in sexual activity


Not having sexual thoughts or fantasies, or having them a lot less than you used to


Not initiating (starting) sexual contact with your partner, or not responding to your
partner’s attempts to start sexual contact



Not enjoying sexual activity, or enjoying it much less than you used to, most of the
time



Not becoming aroused by things that may normally stimulate you, such as talking about
sex, seeing erotic images, or reading about sex, and



Not feeling much or any pleasant sensation in your genitals during sexual contact.


The symptoms of what doctors call female orgasmic disorder (FOD) include:



Taking much longer than usual to reach orgasm


Having orgasms much less often than you used to, or not being able to reach orgasm
at all, and



Your orgasms feeling much less intense than they used to.


If your symptoms fit either of the issues above, it’s not likely that they are caused
by anything physical. But your doctor may recommend a scan of your pelvic area, just
to make sure.

What treatments are available?
Most women who have symptoms of sexual dysfunction don’t have any physical problems.
So treatment usually involves dealing with the mental-health issues that you and your
doctor think may be causing you sexual symptoms.

For example, there is a strong link between depression and reduced interest in sex. Many women find that having treatment for depression
helps them to recover their interest in sex.

As part of this treatment, you may be able to have sessions with a counsellor. These may cover issues such as:



Your self-image: for example, you may have problems with low self-esteem; or perhaps
you don’t see yourself as sexually attractive, even though others do



The way you deal with relationships


You and your partner learning about the different ways that women - and men - become
aroused, and



Challenging myths and mistaken beliefs about yourself, your partner and their wishes
and needs, and about sex and sexual desire in general.



Some women address these issues using specific types of therapy. These include:



Mindfulness. Mindfulness techniques help you to enjoy sex by staying 'in the moment', and not
judging yourself, or thinking about distractions or past experiences. Your counsellor
may encourage you to practise mindfulness techniques in non-sexual everyday life first,
before moving onto using the skills in sexual situations



cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT). This type of therapy helps you to leave behind negative behaviours and beliefs,
and to replace them with positive ones. Some therapists recommend keeping a diary
of your thoughts and feelings in sexual situations. This helps you to recognise and
challenge negative thoughts



Sex therapy. This approach is a bit like starting sex again from scratch. You and your partner
don’t try to have sex at first. Instead, you start with simple touching that gradually
becomes more intimate with each session until you feel ready to have sex. You are
encouraged to talk to each other at these times and give each other feedback; and



Psychotherapy. Some women have therapy that works through issues and conflicts that lie behind
their sexual problems.



As well as counselling, your doctor may suggest some medical treatments. For example, if you need treatment for depression, or if you are taking antidepressants
whose possible side effects include reduced sex drive, your doctor may suggest that
you try antidepressants that don’t have this side effect.

As part of whatever approach you take, and depending on your specific needs, your
doctor may also suggest vaginal lubricants, or hormone treatments that help with lubrication.
These may be especially helpful if you are going through the menopause.

What to expect in the future
Many women find that the treatments mentioned above help them to have a more healthy
and satisfactory sex life.

But successful therapy - for any problem, not just a sexual one - depends on your
willingness to give it a chance and work through it.

For example, it’s likely that you will need to challenge your usual thoughts and behaviours
around sex, to see what is not working, and to replace them with ones that do. This
can be hard to do and can take time and patience."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/3000279/Serotonin%20syndrome,Serotonin syndrome,"Serotonin syndrome Last published: Sep 29, 2022
Serotonin syndrome is a bad reaction to a substance called serotonin. It happens when
someone gets too much serotonin from certain medicines. Serotonin is found in some
medicines including antidepressants and migraine treatments.

Serotonin syndrome is not usually dangerous if you get treatment and your serotonin
levels return to normal. But if your symptoms are severe, or if you don’t get treatment,
it can cause death.

If you are taking medicines that contain serotonin, your doctor should explain how
to take them safely. You can use our information to talk to your doctor if you are
concerned.

What is serotonin syndrome?
Serotonin is a substance produced in the brain. It helps your nervous system to send
messages around your body. It is especially important in helping your digestive system
to work properly. But it also does other jobs, including helping to:



Control your mood


Regulate your sleep


Keep your bones strong, and


Clot your blood when you have an injury.


Not having enough serotonin can cause problems with your nervous system. So some people
need to take medicines that contain it. These medicines are used to treat conditions
such as depression, migraine, and severe pain.

But having too much serotonin can also cause problems. This can happen if you take
too high a dose of a medicine that contains serotonin or if you take more than one
medicine that contains it.

Serotonin syndrome can also be the result of an overdose, when someone deliberately takes too much of medicines that contain serotonin.

Remember, severe serotonin toxicity is a medical emergency that can cause death.

If you take medicines that contain serotonin and have symptoms that you think are
linked to those drugs, or if you think that someone you know has taken an overdose of these drugs, such as antidepressants, get medical help straight away.

Medicines that contain serotonin include:


Many types of antidepressant


Some migraine treatments


Some opioid painkillers, and


The herbal supplement St. John’s wort.


If you’re not sure if your medicines contain serotonin, you can ask your doctor or
pharmacist.

What are the symptoms?
The symptoms of serotonin syndrome can vary depending on how much excess serotonin
someone has in their system. Your doctor may call this your level of toxicity.

If someone has a fairly low level of excess serotonin, their symptoms will mainly
affect the muscles and limbs. These symptoms will include:



Stiff muscles, and


Twitching and jerking that you can’t control.


If someone has a higher level of excess serotonin they may also have symptoms such
as:



Anxiety, confusion, and agitation


Diarrhoea


Fever


Excessive sweating, and


Dilated (wide open) pupils.


Tests for serotonin syndrome are not usually needed, because your doctor should be
able to diagnose it from your symptoms, and by asking about your medicines. But your
doctor may suggest tests, including blood and urine tests, just to make sure.

What treatments are available?
The treatments someone needs for serotonin syndrome will depend on how much excess
serotonin is in their system and how badly it is affecting them.

Mild, moderate, and severe toxicity
If you've got a low level of excess serotonin that’s causing mild symptoms that are
not life threatening, you have what doctors call mild toxicity. The only treatments you should need are:



Stopping taking the medicines that have caused the problem. You will probably have
to start taking something similar again, when you have recovered. But you will probably
start with a lower dose. And this will only happen once your doctor is sure that it
is safe



Being monitored for a short while, to make sure you don’t get worse.


If you've got slightly more severe symptoms, what doctors call moderate toxicity, the treatments you need will probably include:



Stopping taking the medicines that have caused the problem until you can safely start
taking them again



Being monitored for at least six hours, to make sure you don’t get worse, and


Taking medicines to deal with anxiety and agitation caused by the excess serotonin.


If you've got very severe symptoms that are possibly life threatening, you have what
doctors call severe toxicity. The treatments you need may include:



Stopping taking the medicines that have caused the problem


Cooling you down quickly if you've got a high fever


Making sure you can breathe easily. You may need to have a breathing tube inserted
if your muscles have stiffened and this is affecting your breathing, and



Taking medicines to deal with anxiety and agitation.


If someone has taken an overdose they may also be given charcoal to swallow. Charcoal helps to soak up any toxins in the digestive system so that
your body doesn’t absorb them.

What to expect in the future
If you have been treated for serotonin syndrome, your doctor should make sure that
you have the information you need about serotonin toxicity before you start taking
any similar medicines again.

For example, your doctor should advise you that you should not take more than one
medicine that contains serotonin or that helps your body to produce it.

If you've got an ongoing problem like depression or migraine, you will probably need
to start taking medicines that contain serotonin again. So your doctor may want you
to start with a lower dose, and they should monitor you carefully for a while until
it’s clear that the dose is safe."

​Septic arthritis is an infection in a joint, most commonly the knee or hip. It is
a medical emergency.

Septic arthritis can usually be treated successfully. But it can lead to serious illness
and even death, especially if not treated quickly. If you think that you have symptoms,
seek medical help straight away.

What is septic arthritis?
We tend to think of arthritis as a long-term condition that develops gradually, usually
as we get older. But septic arthritis is different from other forms of arthritis.
The symptoms come on very quickly and need urgent treatment.

Septic arthritis happens when a joint becomes infected. This causes symptoms including
swelling, stiffness, and severe pain.

The hip and knee are the joints most commonly affected.
Septic arthritis is a medical emergency. If you think that you or someone you know has symptoms, seek medical help straight away.

Treatment can help most people. But delaying treatment can cause permanent joint damage
and even death.

Septic arthritis is especially dangerous in older people. But even in younger people,
about 10 in 100 people with the condition will die.

What causes septic arthritis?
An infected joint can be caused by many things, including an injury, or an infection
that travels to the joint in the blood.

Some things make it more likely to happen. Doctors call these things risk factors. Risk factors for septic arthritis include:



An existing problem with your joints, such as osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis


Having a prosthetic (artificial) joint


Being an intravenous (injecting) drug user


Taking medicines that affect your immune system: for example, some medicines for an
autoimmune condition, such as rheumatoid arthritis



Being HIV positive


Being a heavy drinker


Having diabetes


Having had recent joint surgery


Having an infection, especially a skin infection, and


Tick bites.


Septic arthritis can also be caused by a gonorrhoea infection, and by tuberculosis.
What are the symptoms?
The main symptoms of septic arthritis include:


A swollen joint. This is usually the hip or knee


Severe pain in the joint that came on fairly quickly. If your knee is affected you
will probably be unable to walk



Stiffness in the joint. You might not be able to bend it


Heat and redness around the joint, and


Fever and chills.


If your doctor suspects that your symptoms are caused by septic arthritis, they will
take a sample of fluid from around the joint, using a needle. This fluid will then
be tested for infection.

Your doctor will also ask you questions about your medical history. For example, they
might ask if you:



Have recently had an infection or been injured


Have recently had surgery


Have diabetes


Have a history of joint problems, and


What medicines you are taking.


What treatments are available?
Test results can take time, but septic arthritis is an emergency. So your doctor will
not wait for your test results before starting treatment.

There are two main treatments for septic arthritis. These are antibiotics and draining fluid that has built up around the joint.

Antibiotics
Antibiotics are used to kill the bacteria that caused the infection. You will be admitted to
hospital and given antibiotics directly into a vein (intravenously).

You will need to be given antibiotics in this way for several days, and probably for
up to two weeks. But if it’s safe for you to be given antibiotics intravenously closer
to home, you might not have to stay in hospital for the whole time.

After being given antibiotics into a vein for up to two weeks, you will probably need
to take a course of antibiotic tablets for several weeks more.

Draining fluid around the joint
Your doctor will use a needle to drain fluid that has built up around the joint. You
might need to have this done more than once if fluid builds up again.

Draining the fluid helps in several ways: it physically removes infection; and it
reduces painful swelling in and around the joint.

If you still have pain after the joint is drained, you can take simple painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen.

If your hip joint has been affected, you will need an ultrasound scan to help the doctor to find the
best place to drain the fluid. You might also need surgery to remove some infected
tissue.

If the infected joint is prosthetic (artificial) you should be referred to a specialist in prosthetic joints.

What to expect in the future
Most people recover well with treatment. But septic arthritis is a serious condition.
More than 10 in every 100 people will die from it. Older people and those with existing
joint problems are especially vulnerable.

So it’s vital to follow your doctor’s advice about what to do after you have treatment.
If you are given antibiotic tablets to take home, it’s important to finish the course
as advised by your doctor. They will want to follow up with you a little while after
your treatment, to check that you are okay.

You should also keep a close eye on the affected joint. If your symptoms return, get medical help straight away.

If you have septic arthritis linked to gonorrhoea, you will need to inform your sexual
partners, so that they can have treatment."

Without treatment, sepsis can quickly lead to multiple organ failure and death. Spotting
the signs of sepsis can help in getting treatment quickly.
What is sepsis?
Children get infections all the time, from simple viral infections like colds, to
more serious infections that need treatment.

The body’s usual reaction to an infection is to help fight it. But sometimes our bodies
react to infections in ways that harm us. This is called sepsis. It can cause damage
to major organs and even death.

If you suspect that your child might have sepsis, get emergency medical help immediately.
Sepsis is life threatening, and early treatment gives a child the best chance of recovery.


Children can get sepsis at any age, including when they are babies. This is called
neonatal sepsis.

Any child with an infection can develop sepsis, but it is more likely in children:


who have had a recent injury, especially if the skin was broken


who have recently had surgery or another medical procedure


with a weakened immune system, either because of illness or certain medicines they
have been taking



whose mother had an infection late in her pregnancy


who have an indwelling (this means it is inside the body) catheter to drain urine.


Septic shock
You might have heard the phrase septic shock. Septic shock is a dangerous complication
of severe sepsis. When sepsis progresses to septic shock it becomes harder to treat.


What are the symptoms?
Sepsis can be hard to recognise, because the symptoms are not always obvious. Some
children with sepsis might just appear to be over-tired or a bit ‘under the weather’.


In babies, it might simply be that they behave differently from usual. For example,
your baby might:



not want to feed


have irregular breathing


have an abnormally fast heartbeat (called tachycardia).


Other symptoms of sepsis, especially in toddlers and older children, can include:


changes to the appearance of the skin, such as a rash that doesn’t go away when you
gently press it, or a very pale or bluish tinge. But many children with sepsis don’t
have any changes to their skin



fever, or sometimes even an unusually low temperature


a fast heartbeat


fast breathing (called tachypnoea)


altered mental state: for example, sleepiness, irritability, floppiness, or seeming
confused or unaware of what is going on around them



not urinating as much as usual.


Septic shock symptoms
If a child has septic shock he or she will probably have some extra symptoms. There
are two types of septic shock in children. These are called cold shock and warm shock.


Cold shock is the most common type in infants and young children. The main symptoms
are:



cold hands and feet


a weak pulse


a fast heartbeat.


Warm shock is the most common type in older children. The main symptoms are:


an unusually strong pulse


fever.


Tests
If your doctor thinks that your child has sepsis, he or she will want to do some tests.
These might include blood and urine tests, and a chest x-ray.

What treatments work?
If you think your child has sepsis it’s vital to get treatment as soon as possible.
Get emergency medical help immediately.

Antibiotics
The main treatment for sepsis is antibiotics. These are drugs that kill bacteria.
Bacterial infection is the most common cause of sepsis.

Your child will have blood tests to try to find out exactly what has caused the infection.
The doctor can then target the infection with the best antibiotics for that particular
bacteria. This is because different antibiotics work better for different infections.


But if your doctor thinks that there is a good chance that your child has sepsis,
he or she will not wait for test results. After the blood tests your child will be
given general antibiotics straight away. The doctor can then change your child’s antibiotics,
if needed, based on the test results.

Other treatments
Your child will probably need other treatments to give him or her the best chance
of recovery. These might include:



oxygen to help your child breathe regularly


intravenous (IV) fluids, to make sure your child is not dehydrated


medicines to raise low blood pressure. This helps make sure that enough blood and
oxygen get to your child’s organs



antifungal medicine. Some infections that cause sepsis are caused by fungal infections.


Some children might also need to use a ventilator for a while to help them breathe
normally. This involves inserting a breathing tube into the lungs through the mouth.
This is called intubation.

What will happen?
If your child has sepsis he or she will need to stay in hospital for about a week,
possibly in an intensive care unit (ICU).

Sepsis can be fatal. About 10 in 100 children treated for sepsis will not survive.


Most complications of sepsis, such as organ damage, are temporary. But some children,
especially babies, have long-term problems with their nerves. For example, they might
have weakness or numbness in their hands or feet.

The nervous system can often repair itself over time. But some children need treatment
for these problems.

After your child’s treatment is finished, your doctor will want to keep a close eye
on his or her health and development.

Some children get sepsis several times. This is called recurrent sepsis. If this happens
to your child, he or she might need treatment to help prevent sepsis happening again."

Many types of infection can lead to sepsis. But the most common ones are infections
that affect the lungs, the urinary tract, and the bowels (intestines).

Anyone with an infection can develop sepsis. But it is more likely in people who:


are aged over 65


have a weakened immune system


have diabetes


have recently had surgery


have recently had an injury that broke the skin


are pregnant or who have recently been pregnant


inject recreational (‘street’) drugs, such as heroin


have an indwelling catheter (this means it’s inside your body) for draining urine.


Septic shock
Septic shock is a dangerous complication of severe sepsis. It can cause dangerously
low blood pressure. This means that your major organs don’t get enough blood supply
and can’t work properly. When sepsis develops into septic shock it becomes harder
to treat.


What are the symptoms?
If you have sepsis, getting treatment quickly gives you the best chance of a good
recovery. But sepsis can be hard to spot, as the symptoms, such as fever and feeling
unwell, can be similar to those of many common illnesses.

But if someone has sepsis or septic shock they often have other symptoms, including:


fast breathing (called tachypnoea)


a fast heartbeat (called tachycardia)


a change in mental state, such as being confused or struggling to make sense


skin that is very pale or mottled (patchy looking), or that has a bluish appearance


not needing to urinate as much as usual.


If your doctor thinks that you might have sepsis, he or she will arrange some tests.
If this is your regular, general doctor, he or she might also arrange transport to
hospital for you.

The tests you have will include blood tests, and possibly a chest x-ray and an electrocardiogram
(ECG) to check your heart rhythm.

With these tests your doctor will try to find out exactly what has caused the infection
so that you can get the best treatment. These tests can also show if you are in danger
of any organ damage.

What treatments work?
If you have sepsis it helps to get treatment as soon as possible. So if you think
that you or someone you know has sepsis, get medical help immediately.

Antibiotics
The main treatment for sepsis is antibiotics. These are drugs that kill bacteria.
Most infections that lead to sepsis are caused by bacteria. You might be given antibiotics
as tablets or as an intravenous (IV) drip.

You will have blood tests to try to find out exactly what bacteria has caused your
infection. This is because different antibiotics work better for different bacterial
infections.

But if your doctor thinks that there is a good chance that you have sepsis, he or
she will not wait for test results. After your blood tests you will be given general
antibiotics straight away. Your doctor can then change your antibiotics, if needed,
based on your test results.

Other treatments
You might need treatments as well as antibiotics. This might include:


medicines to raise low blood pressure. This helps increase the blood flow to your
organs so that they can work as well as possible



oxygen to help you breathe regularly


fluids through an intravenous (IV) drip, to keep you hydrated.


If you have severe sepsis, or if you have septic shock, you will need to be treated
in an intensive care unit (ICU).

What will happen?
Many people have successful treatment for sepsis and make a full recovery. But it
is a life-threatening condition and many people don’t survive, even with treatment.



About 30 in 100 adults treated for sepsis do not survive


About 40 in 100 adults treated for septic shock do not survive.


For people who recover from sepsis, the organ damage caused by the condition, such
as kidney damage, is usually temporary.

But sepsis can cause long-term problems, including damage to the nerves. This can
cause numbness, weakness, and pain in some parts of the body.

The nervous system can often repair itself over time, and there are are treatments
that can help with this nerve damage. But some people need long-term treatment for
complications of sepsis."

What is it?
Self-help for panic disorder can take many different forms.


Some self-help programmes are available on the internet. You work through different modules online. For example, you may learn about the
symptoms of panic attacks and why they happen.

There might also be modules on breathing exercises, relaxation, and cognitive restructuring.
In cognitive restructuring, you're asked to think about assumptions you make and decide
whether these are realistic.

For example, if you're worried about going out of the house because you fear that
something terrible will happen, you'll be asked to think about how likely this is.
You might get emails from a therapist to check how you are getting on and to answer
any questions you might have.



Another self-help programme might involve working through books, CDs, and DVDs at
home. These would most likely cover the same sorts of things that a programme on the
internet would.



Alternatively, you might see a therapist, either on your own or in a group. The therapist
would give you exercises and information to work through at home. But you would still
have contact with a therapist from time to time. This might be over the telephone
or in person.



With all of these methods you should still have some contact with a health professional.
This might be a doctor, a psychologist, or a therapist. But how often you see them
will vary according to your treatment.

How can it help?
Studies suggest that self-help can work well for people with panic disorder. Your
symptoms of panic may get better and you may have fewer panic attacks. You may also
feel less anxious and depressed.

But you need to be prepared to work on your own for self-help to work. If your symptoms
are very distressing, you might find this difficult.

If you have agoraphobia, this can also get better with self-help techniques. (People
with agoraphobia are extremely anxious about situations that they may not be able
to get out of, or places that they cannot run away from.)

How does it work?
Self-help teaches you about why you get panic attacks and gives you the skills to
manage your panic symptoms so that they don't happen at all, or they are less severe
or frequent.

For example, you might learn about how the way you think affects the way you feel.
By changing the way you think about life, you may feel less anxious. This may help
prevent panic attacks and help you get on with your life."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/3000287/Seasonal%20affective%20disorder,Seasonal affective disorder,"Seasonal affective disorder Last published: Sep 29, 2022
If you have depression or bipolar disorder that gets worse in autumn and winter, or
that only seems to happen at these times, it’s called seasonal affective disorder,
or SAD for short.

If you think you may be affected by SAD, you can use our information to talk to your
doctor about the best treatments for you.

What is seasonal affective disorder (SAD)?
SAD is often thought of as depression that only affects some people in autumn and
winter. But this is only partly true. Most people with SAD have long-term depression that gets worse in these months.

SAD can also affect people with bipolar disorder. People with this condition have symptoms that can swing between depression and mania
(feeling unusually excited and energetic).

When people with bipolar disorder are affected by SAD, their depression symptoms usually
get worse in autumn and winter, and their mania symptoms improve in spring and summer.
It can happen the other way around, but this is less common.

What causes SAD?
We’re not really sure. But it’s possible that lower levels of light in autumn and
winter affect some of the body’s hormones. This, in turn, may affect some people’s
mood.

One hormone in particular, called melatonin, is thought to be affected. This hormone helps to regulate our sleep patterns and
our mood.

SAD also seems to be partly genetic. This means that it’s more common in people who
have close relatives with the condition.

Other things we know about SAD include that:


It usually begins between the ages of 20 and 30 years. It’s less likely to happen
the older you get



It’s not really clear how common it is in adults. Estimates vary between 1 and 10
in every 100 people



It affects between 3 and 4 in 100 children and teenagers, especially girls during
puberty, and



It is between 3 and 5 times more common in women than in men.


What are the symptoms?
The symptoms of SAD are similar to those of depression, such as:


Feeling low


Lacking interest in things you usually enjoy


Feeling hopeless and worthless, and


Possibly thinking about harming yourself or about suicide.


But in the autumn and winter months people with SAD can also have different symptoms,
including:



Sleeping more than usual


Wanting to eat more than usual, especially carbohydrates


Gaining weight


Moving slowly and sluggishly, and


Feelings of heaviness in the limbs.


If you see your doctor about symptoms of SAD, they will ask you questions about your
symptoms, and about your history of depression or bipolar disorder.

This helps your doctor to understand if and exactly how the condition affects you,
and what treatments may help.

For example, your doctor will ask:


How long you have been having symptoms


What symptoms you have


What time of year your symptoms begin, and


What time of year your symptoms improve or go away.


Your doctor may also suggest blood tests to make sure nothing physical is causing
your symptoms.

What treatments are available?
The aims of treatment for SAD are to:


Help to control your symptoms, and


Help you to get on with your life as normally as possible.


The two main treatments used to help people with SAD are:


Light therapy. This involves using a special light box to mimic the effect of daylight on your
body, and



Antidepressant medicines.



Depending on your symptoms, your doctor may recommend that you start with one of these
treatments, or that you have both together.

These two treatments seem to work about as well as each other, although light therapy
seems to start to work more quickly. But you may find that you prefer one over the
other for your own reasons. For example:



Sme people may prefer light therapy if they are concerned about side effects of antidepressants


Others may prefer medicines because they struggle to sit in front of a light box for
long periods.



Light therapy
Light therapy involves sitting in front of a light box for between 30 minutes and
two hours a day, depending on which box you use. Your doctor can advise you about
which type you need.

When you are using the light box you need to stay awake and keep your eyes open. To pass the time you can read or listen to music.

With light therapy, symptoms usually start to improve within one to three weeks. It’s important to keep up the therapy, or symptoms can get worse again just as quickly.

Light therapy is not suitable for some people. For example, you shouldn’t use it if:


You have a condition that affects your eyes, such as macular degeneration or problems
with your retinas, or



You are taking certain medicines. Your doctor should ask you about any medicines you
are taking before prescribing light therapy or antidepressants.



Medicines
The main medicines used to treat SAD are antidepressants. There are many different
ones, and you can talk to your doctor about the best option for you.

Antidepressants can work well for SAD but they can take several weeks or more before
they start to help with your symptoms.

All antidepressants can cause side effects in some people, including nausea, headaches, and insomnia. Your doctor should discuss
these with you in detail. If side effects bother you a lot, talk to your doctor about
switching to a different drug or a lower dose.

Some people with bipolar disorder also take medicines called mood stabilisers. These drugs help to control symptoms of mania. But these can cause side effects in some people, including shakiness, nausea, and dizziness.

Your doctor should discuss these with you carefully. If side effects bother you, talk
to your doctor. You may be able to switch to a different drug or a lower dose.

If you are prescribed mood stabilisers, you may need to have blood tests from time
to time.

Doctors sometimes prescribe mood stabilisers called valproates. These drugs can cause severe birth defects. If you are female and of childbearing age, your doctor should not prescribe these drugs unless:



There is no alternative, and


You and your doctor have made a pregnancy prevention plan.


Other treatments
Depression can make you feel sluggish and tired, so that you don’t feel like getting
out and about or exercising. Sitting in front of a light box for a long time can also reduce the amount of time
you spend being active.

So you may need to think about how you can stay active. Exercise is important for
your physical health, and it can help to improve symptoms of depression.

Some doctors also recommend a 'talking treatment' called cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for some people.

Prevention
Doctors sometimes recommend treatments during the summer months, to help prevent the
worst symptoms when the weather changes in autumn and winter. If you think that this
is something that may help you, talk to your doctor.

What to expect in the future
Your doctor may suggest regular check-ups to see how your treatment is working. For
example, they will probably stress the importance of keeping up your light therapy.

It’s not uncommon for people with depression and bipolar disorder to use alcohol or
drugs to try to help with their symptoms. This can actually make symptoms worse by
interacting with your medicines.

If you are concerned about problems with substance abuse, talk to your doctor about
getting help.

In many people, SAD comes back year after year. So it’s important to keep up with
your treatment."

Having schizophrenia means that you sometimes think and feel differently from how
you normally would. You might lose touch with reality.

This condition can be frightening and difficult to live with. But the right treatments
can help control the symptoms.

You can use our information to talk to your doctor and decide which treatments are
right for you. To learn more about what happens in schizophrenia and its signs and
symptoms, see the leaflet Schizophrenia: what is it?

Antipsychotics
The main treatments for schizophrenia symptoms are medicines called antipsychotics. You might also hear these called neuroleptics.

Once your symptoms are under control there are other treatments that can help you
cope with your illness and help prevent episodes of psychotic symptoms (called relapses).

The main problem with antipsychotics is the possible side effects. Your doctor should work with you to find the medicine and the dose that helps the
most while causing the fewest side effects. But this can take time.

Why antipsychotics?
Antipsychotics calm you down when you're agitated or upset. They also reduce symptoms
of schizophrenia, such as having strange or distressing thoughts or hearing voices.

Most antipsychotics are taken as tablets. But some come as long-lasting injections.
Injections might be helpful if you find it hard to remember to take medicines.

There are two main groups of antipsychotic:


the older, 'first-generation' antipsychotics, and




the newer, 'second-generation' antipsychotics.


Both the older and newer antipsychotics can work well, but research suggests that:


newer antipsychotics might be better at preventing a relapse, and


the side effects of the newer ones seem to be easier to cope with. If you have recently
been diagnosed with schizophrenia you will probably be offered a newer antipsychotic
first.



It's important to keep taking your medicines after your symptoms are under control.
This helps to prevent symptoms in future. But the side effects can make it hard to
keep taking antipsychotics.

Side effects
The main side effect of older antipsychotics is that they can affect how your brain
controls your muscles. So you might find that your muscles are stiff or shaky, or
that you twitch. You might also feel restless, and have trouble keeping still.

Doctors call these problems movement disorders. If antipsychotic medicines affect you in this way, your doctor might be able to
prescribe other medicines to help control these side effects.

Other side effects of antipsychotics can include:


drowsiness


restlessness


constipation


a dry mouth, and


weight gain.


Weight gain is more common with the newer antipsychotics. In some people, newer antipsychotics
can also cause:



high cholesterol


low blood pressure (this can cause dizziness), and


low sex drive (this is more likely with a drug called risperidone).


These drugs might also increase your chance of getting diabetes.
If you are having trouble with side effects, talk to your doctor. You might be able
to switch to a different drug or try a lower dose.

The side effects of antipsychotics sometimes stop after you have been taking the medicine
for a while.

An antipsychotic called clozapine is sometimes used when other types have not worked. It works well for most people.
But, very rarely, it damages people's white blood cells, which help fight off infection.
So you need to have regular blood tests when you are taking clozapine.

You should also tell your doctor if you get constipation after taking clozapine. In some people this can be a sign of serious side effects
that this drug can cause in the digestive system.

Whatever medicines you take, your doctor should review your treatment regularly to make sure that you are getting the treatment that helps you most, while causing
the fewest problems from side effects.

Pregnancy and valproate
If you are a female at an age when you could become pregnant, your doctor should not
prescribe a medication called valproate unless there is no other suitable treatment.
Valproate causes severe birth defects.

If you do need to take valproate, your doctor should make sure you follow a pregnancy prevention programme. This means that you should:



have a pregnancy test before taking valproate


be given counselling about the dangers of valproate and the need to use effective
contraception while taking it



have regular reviews with your doctor and a specialist.


If you have any questions about valproate, don't hesitate to ask your doctor.
Talking treatments
Once your condition is under control talking treatments (psychotherapies) might help you cope with your illness and help prevent a relapse. But most people
will still need to keep taking their antipsychotic medicines.

Below are some of the most common talking treatments.
Learning more about your illness from a trained professional can help you stay well. You can take part in a programme,
either on your own or with others, to find out about schizophrenia and how to cope
with it, including how to spot the signs of a relapse and what to do about it.

Family therapy might help you cope with your illness and stick with your treatment. It might also
help prevent a relapse.

If you have family therapy you and your family meet with a therapist. You all learn
more about schizophrenia and about ways to communicate better and solve problems together.

Other types of talking treatment might also be helpful. These include cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) and social skills training.

CBT helps you think more positively about your life and find ways of coping with your
schizophrenia symptoms.

Social skills training helps you learn, or relearn, ways of getting on with other
people. This might help if you have become isolated because of your illness.

Your general health
When you're dealing with a mental-health problem it's easy to neglect your physical
health. This is common among people with schizophrenia.

Doctors should be aware of this. And your doctor should make sure that you are regularly
tested for:



common conditions such as diabetes


problems that can be caused by your medicines, and


infections that tend to be more common in people with mental-health problems, such
as hepatitis and HIV.



But there are simple things you can do to keep yourself healthy, such as:


eating regularly and as healthily as possible


stopping smoking (if you smoke) or cutting down. If you need help to stop smoking,
talk to your doctor, and



being as active as possible. This doesn't need to mean going to a gym or playing sport.
Just going for a walk, perhaps in a favourite park, can be good exercise. And being
active and outdoors is good for your mental as well as your physical health.



Non-medical help
People with mental-health conditions such as schizophrenia often have problems with
issues like housing, low income, employment, and support from family and friends.
And people do better when they get help with these problems.

You might hear your doctor call this kind of help psychosocial support. He or she might be able to arrange for you to get some help in some of these areas.

People with schizophrenia who get help with issues like housing, employment, and social
support tend to cope better in many ways, including taking their medicine regularly
and not needing to be hospitalised."

Having schizophrenia means you go through periods where you think and feel differently
from how you normally would. You might lose touch with reality. This condition can
be frightening and difficult to live with. But the right treatments can help you control
your symptoms.

Here, we look at what happens in schizophrenia and at its signs and symptoms. To learn
more about how schizophrenia is treated, see our leaflet Schizophrenia: what treatments work?

What is schizophrenia?
Schizophrenia is usually a long-term mental health condition. If you have schizophrenia
your brain works differently from other people's. This can affect your thoughts, emotions,
and the way you experience the world.

You might go through periods when you find it hard to tell what's really happening
and what you are imagining. Doctors call this psychosis. These confused thoughts can
make you behave in an unusual way.

Medicines can help bring these symptoms under control and prevent them coming back.
But you will probably need to take the medicines for the long term.

Most people with schizophrenia get repeated episodes of psychosis. Between times,
they might be free of symptoms or they might have some nagging symptoms that don't
go away.

Doctors don't know why some people get schizophrenia and others don't. But people
who have a family history of schizophrenia seem more likely to get the illness. Research
also suggests that schizophrenia is more common among people born to older parents,
particularly to older fathers.

Your environment and experiences also seem to play a role. In particular, doctors
think that events that happen when someone is a teenager or young adult can trigger
an episode of schizophrenia symptoms. These events could include:



being under a lot of stress


using some recreational drugs, such as cannabis, or drinking a lot of alcohol.


What are the symptoms?
During a period of psychosis (often called a psychotic episode), you might have beliefs
that aren't true (delusions). For example, you might believe someone is trying to
poison you or control your thoughts. You might also imagine things that aren't real
(hallucinations).

The most common type of hallucination is hearing voices. For example, you might hear
voices telling you what to do or commenting on your activities or actions. The voices
might seem to be coming from inside your head or from outside it.

Other, less common hallucinations are seeing, smelling, or feeling things that are
not really there.

These experiences can be very distressing. You might find it hard to believe that
your experiences are part of an illness. You might feel there is nothing wrong with
you. But your doctor or therapist can tell you when you are ill.

Other symptoms of schizophrenia include feeling withdrawn, isolated, or emotionless.
Doctors call these types of symptoms 'negative symptoms' - you're missing some of
the emotions that you used to have.

When this happens you might appear to be in a very flat mood and


not care about anything


not enjoy things that you used to enjoy


not show any expression on your face, and


be unable to pay attention to anything.


These symptoms can be long-lasting.
Schizophrenia can also make it hard to think in an organised way or remember things.
For example:



you might find it hard to concentrate when you are reading or writing


your speech might be jumbled and hard for other people to follow


you might become very disorganised and find it hard to take care of yourself.


Symptoms of schizophrenia tend to begin when someone is in their late teens, 20s,
or 30s. For men they usually start before the age of 25, and for women before the
age of 35. Symptoms can happen gradually over weeks or months or they can come on
suddenly.

The symptoms of schizophrenia can make life very hard. You might find that everyday
tasks take much more effort. It's common to feel very anxious or angry.

You might also find that you are thinking about death or even about committing suicide.
If this happens talk to your doctor urgently.

What will happen to me?
If you've been diagnosed with schizophrenia you might worry that you'll have to spend
a lot of time in hospital and that you won't be able to live a normal life.

Schizophrenia does have a big effect on your life. But everyone is different.
Some people have long periods of time when they are free from symptoms or only have
low-level symptoms that don't stop them getting on with their life.

Other people need more frequent contact with mental health professionals and social
service providers (for example, for help with employment issues and housing). And
some people need more time in hospital and are ill for much more of the time.

But however much treatment you need you'll probably need to keep taking medicine,
even when you are well, to keep your symptoms under control.

Other people's attitudes
The way that other people think about schizophrenia can make life harder than it needs
to be. Some people are afraid that people with schizophrenia are dangerous.

It's true that some people act in a violent way when having psychotic symptoms. But
most people with schizophrenia are never violent towards other people.

Your care plan
If you have been diagnosed with schizophrenia you should be given a care plan. This
is where you decide with a team of health professionals on what sort of care you need.

The care plan will say how often you need to have check-ups for your schizophrenia
and who you should contact if you start getting more symptoms. It should also include
a plan for getting regular health checks and any support services.

If you don't already have a care plan, ask your doctor if one can be set up. That
way you'll know what sort of care you should expect."

to find out more. Below are some questions you may want to ask.



Are you certain I've got schizophrenia?


Is there anything else that could be causing my symptoms?

Schizoaffective disorder combines symptoms of schizophrenia with symptoms of mental-health
problems that affect your mood, such as depression and bipolar disorder.

It is a complicated condition that can be difficult to diagnose. But, once diagnosed,
there are treatments that can help.

If you think that you, or someone you live with or care for, are affected by schizoaffective
disorder, you can use our information to talk to your doctor about the best approach
for you.

What is schizoaffective disorder?
Having schizoaffective disorder is a bit like having a mixture of two mental-health
conditions. These are:



Schizophrenia, where people struggle to tell what is real from what is imagined (this
is called psychosis), and



Conditions that involve depression (doctors call these mood disorders).



People with schizoaffective disorder seem to fall into two main groups:


Those with symptoms of depression as well as schizophrenia. This is more common in older people



Those with symptoms of bipolar disorder as well as schizophrenia. This is more common in younger people. People with bipolar
disorder can swing between feeling depressed and then manic and over-excited.



Who is affected by schizoaffective disorder?
We don’t really know what causes this condition, but genetics are thought to play
an important part. We do know that:



It is less common than schizophrenia, and affects less than 1 in 100 people


It is more common in women than in men


It can start at any age, but it usually begins before the age of about 35 years.


Schizoaffective disorder and substance abuse
People with schizoaffective disorder are often affected by substance abuse. This can
cause various problems, including problems at home and work.

The link between schizoaffective disorder and drug abuse is complex.
For example, substance abuse can make symptoms worse, and can sometimes cause psychosis
to begin with. But it’s also likely that some people abuse drugs to try to deal with
the symptoms.

What are the symptoms?
The symptoms of schizoaffective disorder are complex, because they cover two types
of mental-health condition. So it can be hard to diagnose and easy to confuse with
other problems.

People are sometimes wrongly diagnosed with other conditions, such as schizophrenia,
bipolar disorder, or depression, before the real problem becomes clear over time.

The symptoms that make up schizoaffective disorder can include:


Hallucinations (including hearing voices in your head)


Delusions (believing things that aren’t true)


Behaving strangely


Struggling to feel any pleasure in things that usually make you happy


Not feeling motivated


Not wanting to see people and becoming isolated


Feeling anxious


Feeling unusually happy and excited for short periods


Struggling to form clear thoughts or to talk in clear sentences


Repeating yourself a lot


Having trouble remembering things, and


Being easily distracted, and jumping from one idea to the next.


If your doctor thinks that you may have schizoaffective disorder, they may suggest
some tests to rule out other possible causes of your symptoms, such as thyroid problems.
These may include blood tests and scans.

Assessment for self-harm and suicide
Having schizoaffective disorder can make you more likely to harm themselves or to
attempt suicide. So your doctor will want to assess whether you may be a danger to
yourself. They will ask you, or someone who is with you, questions about:



Your state of mind at the moment


Whether you have tried to harm yourself before


Whether you use any drugs or drink a lot of alcohol


Your personal and family history of mental illness


Your home life, and


What support you have at home and in your community. For example, if you are feeling
low, is there someone you trust that you can talk to?



What treatments are available?
Schizoaffective disorder is a lifelong condition, and the approach to your treatment
should reflect this. For example, it should involve:



Finding the right long-term drug treatments that help you live as normal and stable
a life as possible



Therapy ('talking treatments') to help you understand and cope with your condition


Making sure your physical health doesn’t get neglected


Trying to help with social issues: for example, issues with your home life, housing,
work, and relationships, and



A long-term follow-up plan to make sure you keep doing as well as possible.


Education
Schizoaffective disorder can be hard to understand and cope with. But people do much
better when they learn all they can about it. Your doctor can help you to find useful
information about the condition.

Medicines
The medicines usually used to treat schizoaffective disorder are antipsychotics and antidepressants. These can work well to control symptoms, but they can cause problems.

For example, for people who often forget to take tablets, long-term injections may
be more useful.

These medicines can also cause side effects in some people. Your doctor should discuss these with you carefully. Some of these
side effects can be serious. For example, antipsychotics can cause:



Problems with weight gain and increased blood sugar, which can lead to diabetes, and


Symptoms similar to those of Parkinson’s disease. This is called parkinsonism.



Your doctor should follow up with you regularly, to watch for signs of these problems.
Doctors sometimes prescribe medicines called valproates for schizoaffective disorder. Valproates can cause severe birth defects. If you are female and of childbearing age your doctor should not prescribe valproates unless:



There is no alternative, and


There is a plan in place to stop you becoming pregnant while taking them.


Psychotherapy and other treatments
Talking treatments, where you discuss your condition and how to manage it with a therapist, are an important part of treatment for schizoaffective disorder.

Various talking treatments can help, and they all work slightly differently. One you
may have heard of is called cognitive behaviour therapy or CBT. But they all aim to help you deal with how schizoaffective disorder makes you think
and feel.

Your doctor may also talk about psychosocial treatments. This means that you look at how your condition affects your daily life,
and what you can do to improve things. This can include issues with:



Housing


Income


Improving your work skills


Improving your social support: for example, from friends and community groups, and


Making sure your physical health doesn’t get neglected.


What to expect in the future
There is no cure for schizoaffective disorder, and you will need to have treatment
for life. You may need to change your treatment sometimes - for example, you may need
different medicines - and you will need to have regular follow-up appointments to
check how you are doing.

It’s not possible to say how an individual will do over the long term. But people
with schizoaffective disorder tend to do better than people with schizophrenia, but
not as well as those with long-term depression.

Various things can affect how people cope with the condition. For example, as with
many mental-health conditions, people with schizoaffective disorder are more likely
to be affected by substance abuse.

Ideally, people with schizoaffective disorder should avoid alcohol and drugs, as these can make symptoms worse.

Medicines can also cause problems and side effects. For example, some antipsychotic
drugs can increase your chance of getting diabetes. So your doctor should monitor you regularly for any signs of it.

If side effects cause you problems, talk to your doctor. You may be able to switch
to different medicines. But it’s important to not make any changes to your medicines,
or to stop taking them, without your doctor’s agreement.

If you stop taking your medicine suddenly it can cause serious problems, including
the return of your symptoms.

There are many support groups for people with mental-health conditions like schizoaffective
disorder. Your doctor may be able to help you find one, or you can search online."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1205406027786/Scalp%20ringworm,Scalp ringworm,"Scalp ringworm Last published: Jul 24, 2020
Despite the name, ringworm has nothing to do with worms. It's a skin infection caused
by a fungus, a lot like the one that causes athlete's foot.

What is scalp ringworm?
You get ringworm when a certain fungus infects your skin. Fungal infections can affect
any part of your body. When they affect the scalp they tend to cause patches of hair
loss. The medical name for ringworm on the scalp is tinea capitis.

Scalp ringworm is particularly common in children, but adults can get it too.
Children can pick up a fungal infection in several ways:


Through close contact with someone else who has it


By touching personal items (such as a comb, towels, or bedding) that have the ringworm
fungus on them



From soil


From contact with an infected animal. For example, dogs and cats can get ringworm,
as can some farm animals, such as cows.



What are the symptoms?
When ringworm affects a smooth patch of skin it can cause a ring-shaped rash. This
is how it gets its name. But scalp ringworm symptoms are slightly different. Scalp
ringworm causes patches of hair loss. The skin in these patches may look grey or be
covered in black dots. The dots are hairs that have broken off.

Children with scalp ringworm may also have a flaky scalp that looks like bad dandruff.
Your child's scalp may itch, or even be quite sore. Severe ringworm of the scalp can
turn into a tender, inflamed area called a kerion.

Doctors sometimes do laboratory tests on scalp ringworm, by brushing or scraping some
flakes of skin from your child's scalp. But if your doctor suspects your child has
scalp ringworm he or she will probably want to start treatment early, without waiting
for test results.

What treatments work?
The treatment for scalp ringworm is antifungal tablets. There are also some steps
you can take to stop your child spreading ringworm to anyone else.

Drug treatments
Depending on which drug treatment your doctor recommends, your child will need to
take the tablets for between two and eight weeks. It's important that they finish
the course of tablets as instructed by their doctor.

Antifungal tablets can sometimes cause side effects in some people, including nausea,
stomach pain, headaches, or a rash.

You could also try using antifungal shampoos. They don't help get rid of ringworm,
but they can help to reduce the spread of the fungus to other people. If your child
uses antifungal shampoo he or she will still need to take their antifungal tablets.

Stopping ringworm spreading or coming back
It's fine for children to go to school while they're having treatment for scalp ringworm.
But your child shouldn’t share things such as towels, bedding, hats, combs, or hairbrushes.
Make sure you wash towels, clothes, and bedding regularly. To stop your child getting
infected again after treatment, wash their combs and brushes with a disinfectant,
such as diluted bleach.

If you think a pet has ringworm, take it to the vet. Ringworm on animals usually looks
like a bald patch on their fur. If you don't have your pet treated your child could
catch ringworm again.

What will happen?
Ringworm can be cured with treatment. But without treatment the infection can last
a long time. It's important that your child gets treatment, as severe scalp ringworm
could cause a bald patch on his or her scalp."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1578255994000/Scabies,Scabies,"Scabies Last published: Mar 14, 2022
Scabies is a skin infection that makes you extremely itchy. It's caused by tiny creatures
called mites that burrow under your skin.

What is scabies?
You catch scabies by being in close contact with someone who is infected. Generally
this means skin contact, such as with a sexual partner, or close contact with someone
in your household. You wouldn't usually catch scabies just by shaking hands, for example.


The mites can only live on people. They can survive for a while on sheets, towels,
and clothes, but not for very long. It is possible to catch scabies from clothes,
towels, and bedding, but it's not very likely.

You might feel upset or embarrassed by the thought of mites living in your skin. But
anyone can get scabies.

What are the symptoms?
Scabies makes you itch because the mites cause an allergic reaction. But it can take
several weeks before this happens. You'll also get a rash, which looks like tiny insect
bites or spots. If you scratch a lot you might get crusty sores as well.

Scabies can make your whole body feel itchy. But you will probably notice a rash in
just a few places. Children are more likely to get a rash over most of their body.
The itching might be worse at night.

You won't usually be able to see the mites that cause scabies. They're about the size
of the point of a pin. They make tunnels under your skin and lay their eggs in them.
Sometimes you can see the tunnels. They look like fine silvery lines on your skin.

People with a weak immune system, such as older people and people with HIV, can get
a more serious type of scabies, called crusted scabies or Norwegian scabies. The rash
looks scaly or crusty and covers a much larger area of skin than ordinary scabies.

What treatments work?
If you think you have scabies, see your doctor or nurse. You will need a treatment
to kill the mites. Because scabies spreads very easily, the people you live with will
need treatment too, even if they don't have symptoms. If you have a sexual partner
they'll also need treatment.

Most treatments for scabies come as creams or lotions that you rub on your skin. Permethrin
cream is often the first treatment doctors recommend trying. Research suggests that
it works better than the other available treatments.

When you use permethrin you need to cover your whole body from your neck down to the
soles of your feet, including in between your fingers and toes, in your groin, and
under your nails.

You then wash the treatment off after eight to 14 hours. You might need to repeat
the treatment in 10 to 14 days. If you don't use the treatment properly it might not
work.

Other creams and lotions for scabies include malathion, benzyl benzoate, lindane,
sulfur, and ivermectin. Ivermectin also comes as a tablet. Some people prefer ivermectin
tablets if they find it hard to use the creams and lotions properly.

If you use this treatment your doctor will probably recommend taking two doses of
ivermectin tablets, one to two weeks apart.

If you have the severe form of scabies your doctor will probably prescribe ivermectin
tablets as well as one of the creams listed above. Your doctor might also recommend
using another treatment, called urea cream, to help the medicine get into your skin.

What will happen to me?
Treatment will usually kill the scabies mites. Your doctor will also advise you to
wash all your bedding and clothes in hot water (at least 60°C [140°F]) and dry them
in a dryer on high heat. Any items that cannot be washed should be placed in a sealed
bag for one week.

If the first treatment you try doesn't work your doctor might prescribe a different
type of treatment.

You might still have itching for a few weeks after treatment has killed the mites,
while your skin heals. Your doctor might recommend using an antihistamine to help
with the itching.

Scabies doesn't cause any long-term health problems. But there's a chance your skin
could get infected with bacteria if you scratch the itch."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/3000153/Sarcoidosis,Sarcoidosis,"Sarcoidosis Last published: Mar 14, 2022
Sarcoidosis is a rare condition that causes small lumps to grow in some organs in
the body, usually the lungs. It can also cause red patches to appear on the skin.


Not everyone needs treatment, but medications can help with the symptoms. If you have
sarcoidosis, you can use our information to talk with your doctor about what treatments
are best for you.

What is sarcoidosis?
If you have sarcoidosis, small lumps or patches grow on some of your internal organs
and often on the skin. These lumps and patches are called granulomas. They can affect your health by damaging the affected organs.

Sarcoidosis is a rare condition that usually affects people when they are aged between
20 and 40. We don’t know what causes it. But it seems to be more common in some groups
of people, including:



women




people with a family history of sarcoidosis




black people, and




people with Scandinavian heritage.


The symptoms of sarcoidosis can vary from mild to very severe. And it can sometimes
cause death, although this is rare.

In about half of people, the condition gets better by itself after a while. But the
more severe your symptoms are, the less likely you are to recover.

In most people, sarcoidosis affects the lungs, the lymph nodes (small glands in the
armpits, neck, and groin, among other places), and the skin. But it can affect most
organs, especially the heart, eyes, and nervous system.

What are the symptoms?
The symptom of sarcoidosis that you are most likely to notice is red patches (granulomas)
on the skin.

Because the lungs are usually affected, you will probably also have symptoms similar
to those caused by asthma, such as:



coughing




wheezing




shortness of breath, and sometimes




chest pain


Depending on what other organs are affected, you could have other symptoms, which
could include:



tiredness that doesn’t go away after you rest or sleep (called chronic fatigue




weight loss




mild fever




sensitivity to bright light




painful, red eyes (this is called ocular sarcoidosis), and





pain and stiffness in the joints.


If you have sarcoidosis that affects the nervous system (called neurosarcoidosis)
you might have other symptoms, such as:



headaches




weak muscles in the face (called facial palsy), and




seizures.


If you see your doctor with any of these symptoms, he or she will probably want to
do some tests. These might include:



a chest x-ray, so your doctor can look at your lungs




blood tests




an electrocardiogram (ECG) to test whether your heart rhythm is normal




tests to see how well your lungs are working. This will probably involve checking
how much air you can blow out in one breath





a biopsy of any organs affected by sarcoidosis. This involves taking a small amount
of tissue with a needle, for testing. You will probably only need this test if your
doctor is sure that you have sarcoidosis. So it won’t be one of the first tests you
have.



What treatments work?
Not everyone with sarcoidosis needs treatment. Doctors usually only recommend treatment
for people with symptoms that are causing them problems.

In many people, the condition gets better after a while without any treatment. But
this is less likely to happen the more severe your symptoms are.

For most types of sarcoidosis the main treatment is medications called corticosteroids. These are drugs that reduce inflammation (swelling). This helps to control the granulomas,
which can help the affected organs to work normally.

For example, reducing inflammation in the lungs can help with breathing symptoms.
And treating the skin with corticosteroids can make it less red and inflamed.

Of course, with any condition that affects the lungs, your doctor will strongly advise
you to stop smoking if you haven’t already. If you need help to stop smoking, ask
your doctor.

Corticosteroids can be taken as pills, or they can be applied as cream for granulomas
on the skin and around the eyes.

Side effects of treatment
If you take them for long periods or in high doses, corticosteroids can cause serious
side effects in some people, including weakened bones, high blood pressure, diabetes,
weight gain, and thinning skin.

So, depending on how severe your symptoms are, your doctor will suggest that you use
the lowest dose possible for your symptoms, and that you sometimes have spells when
you don’t use these drugs.

Your doctor might also recommend that you also take vitamin D and calcium supplements
to keep your bones strong. But you should not take more than your doctor recommends,
as this can cause problems.

If you can’t take corticosteroids for any reason (for example, because of side effects),
or if you need to stop using them for a while, there are other drug options that you
might be able to try.

Severe symptoms
In most people with sarcoidosis, the lungs are affected in some way. Some people have only mild symptoms, such as occasional
wheezing. But others have more serious breathing problems.

If you have severe lung symptoms, you might need more intensive treatments, such as:


higher doses of corticosteroids, possibly through an intravenous (IV) drip for a while




oxygen to breathe through a mask when you need it, and




other medications to help your lungs work more normally.


Some people with severe sarcoidosis in the lungs have a lung transplant. This is a
major operation and a big decision. You can discuss all these treatments with your
doctor to decide which are the best options for you.

If you have sarcoidosis that affects your eyes, the main treatment is corticosteroid eye drops. But other treatments can help with
more severe symptoms. For example, your doctor might suggest corticosteroid pills
as well as, or instead of, drops.

Your doctor might also refer you to an ophthalmologist (eye specialist) to check for
problems that sarcoidosis can cause, such as cataracts, glaucoma, and vision problems.


Sarcoidosis that affects the nervous system is usually treated with higher doses of
corticosteroids. But other drugs can be used when needed.

If you have sarcoidosis that affects your heart, your doctor should refer you to a
cardiologist (heart specialist) to manage the problems that this can cause. For example,
you might need to take extra medications to manage your blood pressure.

What will happen?
The severity of sarcoidosis varies hugely from person to person. Some people have
mild symptoms that don’t need any treatment. And most of them will get better after
a while.

For people with more severe symptoms, it’s less simple. Many people still get better,
but it’s less likely. And some people with very severe symptoms will die because of
the damage to the organs that are affected by sarcoidosis.

It’s not possible to say what will happen to you as an individual, though. But your
doctor should monitor you every few months to check on how you’re doing. This could
include checking:



your blood




how well your liver and other affected organs are working, and




your lungs.


Your doctor will also check your bone strength every couple of years. This is because
corticosteroids can make some people’s bones weaker.

For this reason you will probably need to take vitamin D and calcium supplements for
as long as you have sarcoidosis. But you shouldn’t take more than your doctor recommends,
and you will need to take a urine test to check that you don’t have too much calcium
in your system, as this can cause problems, including kidney stones.

There are various charities and support groups for people with sarcoidosis. For example,
in the UK, Sarcoidosis uk (sarcoidosisuk.org) offers information and practical help
to people with the condition.

Your doctor might be able to direct you to a group in your area. Or you could easily
search online."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/3000034/Routine%20screening%20for%20prostate%20cancer,Routine screening for prostate cancer,"Routine screening for prostate cancer Last published: Jan 30, 2023
The prostate is a walnut-sized gland that sits near the bladder. Only men have a prostate
gland. It makes fluid that helps to carry their sperm. Prostate cancer is a common
type of cancer that can happen as men get older.
What is prostate cancer screening?
Prostate cancer can be serious. But in some men it grows so slowly that it does not
cause problems in their lifetime.

Screening is when you have a test to find a condition before symptoms or other problems
happen. This leaflet looks at having a regular blood test called a prostate specific antigen (PSA) to try to find early-stage prostate cancer.

Who is at risk of prostate cancer?
You are said to be at higher risk of getting prostate cancer if you:


have a first-degree relative (father, brother, or son) who was diagnosed with prostate
cancer before the age of 65



are black or have African ancestry


have certain genetic mutations (BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation).


Otherwise you are said to be at average risk.
What is the PSA blood test?
The PSA blood test measures levels of a certain protein produced by cells in your
prostate gland. Men with prostate cancer have a high level of PSA in their blood.


But it isn't that simple. Just because someone has a high PSA level doesn’t mean they
have cancer. High PSA levels can be caused by other things, such as an enlarged prostate,
or prostate infection or inflammation.

Having a high level of PSA is not enough on its own to diagnose cancer. You would
need further tests.

Also, as many as 25 in 100 men diagnosed with prostate cancer have normal levels of
PSA. So the test is far from perfect.

How could having a screening PSA blood test help me?
The point of screening is to find out whether you have prostate cancer and, hopefully,
to reduce your chances of dying from it.

But the evidence about whether screening works in this way is not as clear as we would
like.



Some studies have found that having PSA screening can slightly reduce your chance
of dying from prostate cancer.



Other studies have found that having screening makes no difference to the number of
men who die from prostate cancer.



Could having a PSA test harm me?
There can be some drawbacks to having routine PSA blood tests.
Anxiety or distress
A high blood test result can cause distress, even if all further test results eventually
come back normal.

False-positives
This means that a blood test result is high when there is no cancer. If a PSA test
result is high you will need more tests, including another blood test and possibly
a prostate biopsy. A biopsy is when some cells are taken from the prostate with a
needle to be examined under a microscope.

Over-diagnosis and over-treatment
Prostate cancer can be serious, but it isn’t always. Some men have treatment for prostate
cancers found by PSA screening that might not have caused any problems during their
lifetime.

This can happen if a cancer grows slowly or doesn’t spread, or if the man dies for
another reason before the cancer becomes a problem.

Treatments for prostate cancer, such as surgery and radiotherapy, can also cause complications,
such as incontinence (not being able to control the flow of urine) or impotence (not
being able to get an erection).

Is a rectal examination recommended for prostate cancer screening?
A rectal examination is part of a physical examination. A doctor or nurse uses a lubricated
gloved finger to do the examination. This examination is not usually included as part
of screening. But it can help doctors to diagnose several problems, including prostate
cancer.

What do guidelines recommend about screening?
Various healthcare organisations produce guidelines about prostate cancer screening.


They include the European Society for Medical Oncology, the US Preventive Services
Task Force, the American Cancer Society, the American Urological Society, and the
US National Comprehensive Cancer Network.

The advice in these guidelines varies. But they all agree that you should decide about
prostate cancer screening after a detailed discussion with your doctor about your
individual medical background and your own values and preferences.

If you are at average risk for prostate cancer, most guidelines say to start having
these discussions at about age 50. If you opt for screening, it is mainly done for
people aged between 55 and 69. Most guidelines don’t recommend screening after the
age of 70.

If you have other medical problems your circumstances may be different. The advice
to start discussions about screening generally applies to people who expect to live
at least 10 more years.

If you are at high risk for prostate cancer some guidelines say to start discussing
your medical background with your doctor by age 40 or 45.

If you opt for screening, how often you get tested can depend on your first result.
Some guidance recommends re-testing every one to two years, depending on your test
result.

The UK National Health Service (NHS) currently says that the PSA test is not accurate
enough to meet the requirements of a national screening programme.

What should I do about routine PSA tests?
Your own health issues, values, and preferences are important to deciding about having
a PSA test.

For example, if you are at average risk of getting prostate cancer and are in good
health, you might worry about having cancer more than you worry about having extra
tests or treatments. So you might choose to start having regular PSA tests.

But if you worry about unnecessary tests and treatments more than about prostate cancer,
you might choose not to have PSA testing.

You should make a decision after talking with your doctor about your own medical history
and concerns.

As your health or circumstances change, and as new information becomes available about
prostate cancer screening, you should talk with your doctor again."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/3000232/Rotavirus%20vaccine,Rotavirus vaccine,"Rotavirus vaccine Last published: Aug 30, 2022
The rotavirus vaccine is given to young babies to protect against dangerous stomach
bugs. This leaflet explains how and when the vaccine is given, how well it works,
and how safe it is.

What is rotavirus?
As the name suggests, rotavirus is a virus. It can cause severe stomach upsets that
can sometimes be fatal, usually because of severe dehydration. The symptoms include:



diarrhoea


vomiting


fever, and


staomach ache.


Most children recover from rotavirus infections with simple treatment. But some children
need treatment in hospital for problems including severe dehydration.

Successful vaccinations in developed countries have hugely reduced the levels of serious
illness and death from rotavirus. But each year about 2 million children still die
of rotavirus, mostly in developing countries.

As well as vaccination, good hygiene measures such as hand washing can help prevent stomach bugs in children.

It’s also recommended that babies should be breastfed for the first six months of
life, if possible. Breastfeeding helps prevent infection with rotavirus and other stomach bugs.

Who needs the rotavirus vaccine?
People are usually given the vaccine as young babies, in several doses, for maximum
protection.

Vaccination schedules can vary between countries. For example, in the UK, the rotavirus
vaccine is given in two doses.



The first dose is given when the baby is about eight weeks old.



The second dose is given at 12 weeks old.



If your baby misses a dose of this vaccine, talk to your doctor as soon as possible
to arrange another appointment. Note that:



the first dose needs to be given before your baby is 15 weeks old, and


the second dose needs to be given before your baby is 24 weeks old.


The vaccination is not offered to older babies and children because:


older babies and children have often already had a rotavirus infection, so vaccination
would be pointless, and



there is a very small chance that the vaccine can cause a blocked intestine in older
children.



Are there some babies who shouldn’t have the vaccine?
Your baby should not have the vaccine if:


he or she has a fever, or is very ill with diarrhoea and vomiting. You can talk to
your doctor about making another appointment once your baby has recovered



he or she is allergic to any of the ingredients of the vaccine, or has had an allergic
reaction to a previous dose of the vaccine. Tell your doctor about any allergies that
your baby has before he or she is vaccinated. Note: the vaccine does not contain eggs



the baby’s mother was taking immunosuppressant medications during pregnancy or while breastfeeding. You can talk to your doctor
if you are unsure about any medications that you take.



Is it safe?
The vaccine has been used for many years, so there is plenty of evidence that it’s
safe. But, like all vaccines, it can cause some side effects, including:



being restless and irritable, and


mild diarrhoea a day or two after the vaccine.


Very rarely, the vaccine can cause an allergic reaction. But the medical staff giving
the vaccine will have been trained to deal with this.

Another very rare side effect of the vaccine is a blockage in the intestine, called
intussusception.

If you think your baby might be showing signs of intussusception, call your doctor
straight away. Symptoms on intussusception include:



stomach pain. Your baby obviously can’t tell you that they have stomach pain. But
they might pull their legs up to their chest, which is a sign of stomach pain



severe crying


vomiting


blood in their stools, and


seeming weak or irritable.


Changing your baby’s nappy after the vaccine
You should take special care over hygiene when changing your baby’s nappy for about
two weeks after he or she has the vaccine.

The vaccine contains a weakened version of the virus, which might be harmful if it
is spread to someone with a weakened immune system, such as someone having cancer
treatment.

Breastfeeding
It is fine to breastfeed your baby after he or she has the rotavirus vaccine.
How is the vaccination given?
Unlike most vaccines, which are given as injections, the rotavirus vaccine is given
as a liquid into your baby’s mouth.

Some babies spit out the vaccine. But it’s fine for them to be given another dose,
even if they have swallowed some of the first dose.

How well does the vaccine work?
Evidence suggests that the vaccine works well, and that two doses give protection
for several years.

Vaccinated children can still be infected with rotavirus. But if they become ill their
symptoms will be less severe.

The rotavirus vaccine doesn’t protect against stomach bugs other than rotavirus"

A rotator cuff injury is any kind of damage to the group of tendons and muscles that
surround and support the bones in the shoulder. These injuries can be painful and
you may need treatment, and possibly surgery, to help you recover.

We have brought together the best and most up-to-date research on rotator cuff injury.
You can use our information to talk to your doctor about what treatments are best
for you.

What is rotator cuff injury?
The rotator cuff is a group of muscles and tendons around the shoulder joint. The
rotator cuff keeps the shoulder stable while allowing it to move. Tendons are flexible
chords a bit like strong rubber bands that connect muscles to bones.

A rotator cuff injury is an injury of any kind to the tissues that make up the rotator
cuff. You may also hear it called 'rotator cuff syndrome'.

There are several types of rotator cuff injury:


Tendonitis happens when an injury or strain causes inflammation (swelling) of a tendon.



Bursitis is inflammation of a fluid-filled sac called a bursa. This sac sits under the skin
above the shoulder joint, forming a protective buffer between tendons and bones. Some
injuries can cause bursitis and tendonitis at the same time.



Tears can happen to the muscles and tendons in the rotator cuff. This usually causes severe
pain and difficulty moving. Muscle tears are more common the older we get.



The causes of rotator cuff injuries include:


Constant use of the shoulder joint, especially in an overhead movement: for example,
if you have a job that involves a lot of repetitive overhead shoulder movements, such
as painting, or if you play a sport that involves throwing something



A sudden strain on the shoulder: for example, from pulling or pushing something heavy


Being involved in an accident where the shoulder is stretched, jarred, or dislocated




Damage from gradual wear and tear. Rotator cuff injuries are more common in people
over 40.



What are the symptoms?
Although some people can have a rotator cuff injury that doesn't cause symptoms, most
people will have pain and weakness when moving the shoulder in some ways. You may
also have pain at night. People with severe injuries may have trouble moving their
shoulder at all.

Your doctor will ask you questions about your symptoms, including how long you have
had them, how the pain started (for example, was there an injury or event that triggered
it), and what types of movement cause you pain.

He or she will probably ask you to gently move your arm in certain ways. This helps
establish what type of injury you have.

You may also need an x-ray or other imaging test, such as ultrasound or magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI).

What treatments work?
Minor strains that don't cause you too much discomfort sometimes get better by themselves
in a few weeks. But if you are in severe pain, or if you don't seem to be improving,
you should see your doctor.

There are several treatments that can help with rotator cuff injury. The treatments
your doctor suggests will depend on whether your injury is caused by bursitis, tendonitis,
or a tear.

Treatments for tendonitis and bursitis
If you have a rotator cuff injury caused by tendonitis your doctor will probably suggest treatments to reduce the swelling, beginning with
ice.

To ice a swollen shoulder, wrap some ice or a bag of frozen peas in a thin cloth and
place it on the shoulder for no more than 30 minutes. You can do this several times
a day for several days. You shouldn't put ice directly onto the skin as it can cause
ice 'burns'.

Your doctor may also suggest non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to reduce
the swelling. Ones you may have heard of include ibuprofen and naproxen. Your doctor
should explain the possible side effects of taking these medications for more than
a short time, which include stomach problems.

People who have heart problems should not take an NSAID called diclofenac.
If these measures don't work, or if your swelling or pain is severe, your doctor might
suggest a steroid injection (the full name is corticosteroid) in the shoulder. These
drugs are powerful anti-inflammatories.

For bursitis you may just need to rest the shoulder as much as possible until your symptoms improve.
But if your pain is severe and doesn't go away with rest your doctor may suggest NSAIDs
or a steroid injection.

Treatments for acute (recent) tears
'Acute' is a medical term for something that has happened recently or suddenly. An
acute rotator cuff tear means a tear that has happened in the last six weeks.

Tears can happen in either the muscles or tendons in the rotator cuff, but the treatments
for both are similar. The main decision for you and your doctor is whether you should
have surgery to repair a tear.

Whether you need surgery will depend on several things, including:


The size of the tear


Your age - surgery is more likely to be successful the younger you are


How long ago the tear happened - it's easier to repair a more recent tear


Whether you use your shoulder a lot: for example, if you play a lot of sport or have
a very physical job



The amount of damage to the tissue around the tear


How much your movement is affected by your injury, and


Whether other treatments have helped.


Small tears
If you have a very small muscle or tendon tear there is a chance that your symptoms
improve a lot with the same treatments used to relieve swelling.

Doctors are more likely to recommend this non-surgical approach if you are older,
as surgery tends to have better results in younger people. But most people with an
acute tear are likely to need an operation.

If you choose not to have surgery you'll need to rest your shoulder for about four
weeks before you can start exercising your shoulder to strengthen it. Your doctor
should refer you to a physiotherapist who can show you the best exercises to help
you get stronger without injuring yourself.

If you still don't feel better after these treatments your doctor may suggest surgery
to repair the tear. Everyone who has surgery should have physiotherapy after the operation.

Larger tears
Larger tears are more likely to need an operation to repair them, in order to make
your shoulder stronger and relieve your pain. But if you are older and you don't do
a lot of physical work or sport, your doctor may recommend that you try non-surgical
treatments first.

Tears that can't be repaired
If you have a tear that can't be repaired with normal surgical methods there are other
operations that can help. For example, you could have a muscle transfer, where the
surgeon transplants some muscle from another part of your body onto the rotator cuff
to strengthen it.

Your surgeon may also suggest debridement. This means cutting away damaged tissue
to help the healthy tissue move more freely. This should also reduce your pain.

Treatment for chronic (older) tears
'Chronic' is a medical term that means long lasting. So your doctor may refer to a
tear that happened more than six weeks ago as chronic.

The longer you have had a tear, the harder it is to repair surgically. So your doctor
is likely to recommend treating a chronic tear in some of the same ways that you would
treat a rotator cuff injury that's caused by inflammation.

To begin with that means ice and NSAIDs. But your doctor or physiotherapist might
also recommend some regular gentle stretching of the shoulder to help loosen up the
muscles and tendons so that they don't feel so tight and painful. Your physiotherapist
should show you the correct way to do this without hurting yourself. He or she may
also show you some exercises to help strengthen the rotator cuff.

If these treatments don't help, your doctor may suggest a steroid injection to reduce
swelling in the area.

If you are still in severe pain or unable to move well after trying all the treatments
mentioned above, you may be able to have debridement to remove some of the damaged
tissue. Some people with severe chronic tears need an operation to replace part of
the shoulder joint.

What will happen to me?
Surgery to repair a rotator cuff tear works well in most people. But it can take between
six months and a year for your mobility to get back to normal.

Even if you don't have surgery, strengthening and stretching exercises give positive
results for about two-thirds of people. There are various exercise and rehabilitation
programmes. Some people see a physiotherapist regularly while others have one or two
sessions with the physio, then continue their exercises at home by themselves."

Rosacea is a skin condition that mostly affects the face. The main symptom is redness.
In many people the condition comes and goes, and attacks are 'triggered' by certain
things, including changes in the weather.

Rosacea can’t usually be cured. But treatments can help keep it under control. You
can use our information to talk to your doctor about the best treatments for you.

What treatments work?
Rosacea is a skin condition that mostly affects the cheeks, chin, nose, and forehead.
But it can also affect parts of the upper body.

Rosacea causes different symptoms in different people, including:


occasional flushing (redness)


permanent redness


visible small blood vessels (sometimes called 'spider veins')


spots


rough or swollen skin, and


raised lumps (nodules) on the skin.


For more background information on rosacea, see our leaflet: Rosacea: what is it?
Rosacea is a complex condition that we don’t know enough about. Treatment can be hard
to get right, and you might need to try several treatments before you find something
that works.

The results of treatments can vary a lot. Some people find that treatment helps a
lot, while some people find that nothing they try makes much difference. We don’t
yet know why this is.

Staging rosacea
Treatment for rosacea depends on:


which type or types you have (doctors call these 'subtypes'), and


how severe your symptoms are - which is the same as saying what 'stage' they are at.


Like dividing rosacea into subtypes, staging is another way of guiding doctors towards
the best treatments for individual people.

Doctors divide rosacea into four stages, which basically describe what stage the redness
has reached:



Stage 1 is flushing that comes and goes.


Stage 2 is when the redness doesn’t go away.


Stage 3 is when you get spots as well as redness.


Stage 4 is when you can see swollen spider veins.


Treatments for redness and swelling
The main first treatment for most types of rosacea is antibiotic cream. Antibiotics are usually used to kill bacteria. But they are used to treat rosacea
because they also reduce redness and swelling.

People with more severe symptoms might also need to take antibiotics as pills, or
to use other prescription creams that can reduce inflammation.

Once your treatment starts to work, you should use it for as long as you need to,
or for as long as your doctor advises.

If you find that the treatment isn’t working, talk to your doctor about trying something
else.

If your treatment has worked well your doctor might suggest reducing the dose or stopping
for a while. You might find that your symptoms stay away for a long while before you
need treatment again. But some people need to start treatment again quickly.

Side effects of antibiotics
Like all medicines, antibiotics can cause side effects in some people. The creams
shouldn’t cause you any problems. But the tablets can cause things like diarrhoea,
bloating, and loss of appetite.

If you have side effects that bother you, talk to your doctor. You might be able to
try a different treatment or reduce your dose.

If antibiotics don’t work for you, you might be able to try a drug treatment called
isotretinoin, which is usually used to treat severe acne. But taking isotretinoin
pills can sometimes cause serious side effects, including aggression and muscle problems.


You should never take isotretinoin if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant.
Treatments for other symptoms
Antibiotics can work well to reduce redness and simple swelling. But for more severe
symptoms there are other things you can try.

For spider veins your doctor might suggest medicines that work by reducing the swelling in the veins
in the face.

Or, if your symptoms are severe or they bother you a lot, you could try laser therapy.
This works by using a laser to damage the veins so that they shrink to the point where
you can’t see them any more.

Extra treatments that can help for ocular rosacea include:



regular cleaning of your eyes, and


using eye drops that contain 'artificial tears'. This helps if your eyes become inflamed
because they get too dry.



For thickened skin and nodules (phymatous rosacea) there are some procedures designed to remove excess swollen tissue
without scarring, such as:



surgery


laser treatment, and


electrosurgery.


These treatments might seem extreme. And some people decide that they don’t want
surgical procedures.

If your symptoms bother you a lot but you are unsure about surgery, talk to your doctor
about these procedures. He or she should explain exactly how the treatments work.


Preventing attacks of rosacea
If you have rosacea symptoms that come and go, it’s a good idea to find out what triggers
the attacks. We know what the general triggers are, but they’re not always the same
for everyone.

So you could try keeping a diary to track things that might cause you problems. For
example, note in your diary the day that you do things like eating spicy foods, and
drinking alcohol or hot drinks.

One of the main triggers for rosacea attacks seems to be sun exposure, so you could
try things such as:



using sunscreen on your face every day


avoiding the midday sun, and


wearing a wide-brimmed hat in the sun.


Some cosmetic products can trigger symptoms in some people. You might want to note
whether this affects you, and change the soaps and cosmetics you use, depending on
what seems to cause you problems.

What will happen?
It’s not possible to say what will happen to you as an individual. Rosacea symptoms
vary greatly from person to person.

Some people have symptoms so mild that they choose to have no treatment other than
doing their best to avoid things that trigger attacks.

Other people have severe symptoms that affect their confidence and self-esteem to
the point that they decide to have a surgical procedure.

Treatments work better for some people than for others. Some people find that their
symptoms clear up very well with treatment, while others struggle to find anything
that works.

If your symptoms make you unhappy and you would like more help from people who understand
how you feel, you might be able to find an organisation that provides support and
information to people with conditions that make them look different.

For example, in the UK, the charity Changing Faces (changingfaces.org.uk) has been
helping people for many years.

Your doctor might be able to help you find a group in your area, or you could search
online."

What is rosacea?
Rosacea is a skin condition that mostly affects the cheeks, chin, nose, and forehead.
But it can also affect parts of the upper body.

Rosacea causes different symptoms in different people, including:


occasional flushing (redness. Doctors call this 'erythema')


permanent redness


visible small blood vessels (sometimes called 'spider veins')


spots


rough or swollen skin, and


raised lumps (nodules) on the skin.


In many people the condition comes and goes, so that they have spells with no symptoms.
When symptoms happen they can vary from mild to severe and distressing.

In some people, the swelling can be severe, especially on the nose and in lumps around
the eyes.

For more information on treatments for rosacea, see our leaflet: Rosacea: what treatments work?
Rosacea is common. It affects about 5 in every 100 people. And it can happen to people
of any ethnic background and skin colour. But some people are more likely than others
to get it:



Rosacea is most common in white people with fair skin, of Celtic and northern European
heritage



It is rare in black people


It affects women more often than men


The condition usually starts between the ages of 30 and 50.


We don’t know for sure what causes rosacea. There seem to be several possibilities.
These include:



problems with the blood vessels in the face. Abnormalities in blood vessels can cause
redness and swelling



sun exposure, which can damage blood vessels and make them less 'elastic'. This means
that blood vessels swell up but don’t shrink down again



stress, and


other conditions that cause inflammation (swelling) in the skin.


Two other possible causes have been suggested and are being researched. They are:




tiny mites called demodex mites. They usually live harmlessly on the skin. But some
people with rosacea have unusually high numbers of them on their skin. So doctors
are looking at whether these mites could be linked to rosacea



an infection called Helicobacter pylori. This infection affects the bowel, and is the cause of most stomach ulcers. But there
is a suggestion that it might be linked to rosacea.



Other things that can trigger attacks of rosacea in people with the condition include:


hot baths or showers


spicy foods


sun exposure


sudden exposure to cold, such as going outside in a cold wind


drinking alcohol. Red wine, especially, seems to cause redness in many people


creams that contain medicines called corticosteroids. This might seem strange, as
these creams are used to reduce inflammation (swelling). But in people with rosacea
they seem to cause it.



What are the symptoms?
Doctors often group rosacea into different types according to the different symptoms
that people get.

This doesn’t mean that people with rosacea only ever get one type of symptom - although
many people do have one type more than others - but it helps doctors to know how to
treat the various symptoms.

There are four main types of rosacea, called subtypes:


With subtype 1 the symptoms are flushing (redness that comes and goes), redness in
the centre of the face that is there most of the time, and visible spider veins (called
telangiectasias). Doctors call this erythematotelangiectatic rosacea.



With subtype 2, as well as redness, people have attacks of spots, which can sometimes
contain pus. This is called papulopustular rosacea.

This type of rosacea is sometimes confused with acne. The main difference is that
acne usually begins in your teenage years, while rosacea of any kind doesn’t usually
start before the age of 30.



Subtype 3 is called phymatous rosacea. The symptoms are thickening of the skin and irregular bumps and swelling (nodules).
It usually affects the nose, but it can also affect the chin, forehead, ears, and
eyelids.



Subtype 4 is called ocular rosacea. People with this type have problems with the eyes, including burning and itching,
as well as blurred vision and sometimes swollen eyelids. Many people with ocular rosacea
have other rosacea symptoms as well.



Other types include rosacea that can affect younger women, and rosacea that mainly
affects the skin around the mouth or eyes, but not the eyes themselves.

What will happen?
It’s not possible to say what will happen to you as an individual. Rosacea symptoms
vary greatly from person to person.

Some people have symptoms so mild that they choose to have no treatment other than
doing their best to avoid things that trigger attacks.

Other people have severe symptoms that affect their confidence and self-esteem to
the point that they decide to have a surgical procedure.

https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1205405687381/Ringworm%20of%20the%20body,Ringworm of the body,"Ringworm of the body Last published: Jul 24, 2020
Ringworm of the body is a skin infection caused by a fungus. It has nothing to do
with worms but gets its name from the ring-shaped rash it causes.

What is ringworm of the body?
You get ringworm of the body if a type of fungus called a dermatophyte infects your
skin.

The medical name for this infection is tinea corporis. It is closely related to other
infections caused by dermatophytes, including:



athlete's foot (tinea pedis)


jock itch (tinea cruris)


fungal nail infection (onychomycosis), and


ringworm of the scalp (tinea capitis).


You can pick up the fungus in several ways, including:


through close contact with someone who has the infection


through touching personal items, such as towels or bedding


from contact with an infected animal. Dogs, cats, and some farm animals, such as cows,
can get ringworm.



Ringworm of the body tends to affect smooth patches of skin without much hair on them.
It's more common in children than in adults.

What are the symptoms?
Ringworm usually starts as a red, scaly spot. This spreads outwards over time. The
rash is often itchy. The centre of the rash may start to clear up, making a ring shape.
This is how ringworm gets its name.

You may get one patch of ringworm or several. They sometimes overlap to make a pattern
like the petals of a flower.

What treatments work?
An antifungal cream will cure ringworm for most people. Many of these creams are available
over the counter. There are also things you can do to reduce the risk of spreading
ringworm to others, and to stop it coming back.

Treatments for ringworm
You can buy several antifungal creams from a pharmacist. Some creams are not suitable
for younger children. You can ask your pharmacist whether a particular product is
right for you or your child. If over-the-counter creams don't help, your doctor may
prescribe a stronger cream.

Ringworm starts to clear up for most people when they use an antifungal cream. It’s
important to follow the instructions that come with your treatment.

You will probably need to apply the cream once or twice a day, and keep using it for
a while after the rash has disappeared. If your rash doesn't start to improve after
using a cream for a week or two, see your doctor.

Some people get skin irritation from the creams, but this isn't common.
Stopping ringworm spreading or coming back
If you or your child has ringworm, keep the skin around the infection clean and dry.
Ringworm can be itchy, but try not to scratch. Scratching could break the skin and
cause another infection, or you could spread the fungus around your body on your fingers.


The fungus that causes ringworm thrives in warm, damp environments. So try to wear
loose-fitting clothes and avoid fabrics that hold in moisture.

If you have athlete's foot as well as ringworm, treat both infections at the same
time. Fungus from your feet can spread to other parts of your body and give you ringworm
again.

To avoid spreading the infection to other people, make sure you wash your hands frequently.
Also, don't share personal items such as towels, clothes, and bedding, and wash these
items regularly.

If you think a pet has ringworm, take it to the vet. Ringworm on animals usually looks
like a bald patch on their fur. If you don't have your pet treated, you could catch
ringworm again.

What will happen?
Ringworm can be cured with treatment. But without treatment, the infection can last
a long time. It can also spread to other parts of your body, or to other people. If
you have any questions or concerns about ringworm or its treatment, talk to your doctor."

Rheumatoid arthritis makes your joints swollen and stiff. It can be very painful and
can lead to lasting joint damage. But there are treatments that can reduce pain, help
protect your joints from damage, and let you lead an active life.

You can use our information to talk to your doctor and decide which treatments are
best for you.

What is rheumatoid arthritis?
If you have rheumatoid arthritis some of your joints are painful and swollen. This
happens because of a problem with your immune system.

Your immune system protects you against illnesses by attacking germs in your body.
But if you have rheumatoid arthritis your immune system also attacks the lining of
your joints, causing a painful swelling. This can eventually lead to permanent damage
to your bones and joints.

What are the symptoms?
The symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis usually develop slowly over time, often when
people are in their 50s. When symptoms first start you might notice that your joints
feel a little stiff, especially in the mornings. The small joints of your hands or
feet are usually affected first.

Eventually your affected joints may become stiff, painful, and sore to the touch.
The pain and stiffness are often worse just after you've been sleeping or sitting
still, and they get better as you get moving.

You might get swelling in some joints. Some people also get swellings or lumps under
their skin. These can happen on the back of your elbows or finger joints.

What treatments work?
Many medicines can help with rheumatoid arthritis. Your doctor might recommend taking
a combination of treatments. If one approach doesn't help (or doesn't help enough),
you can try another.

Treatment won't cure your arthritis but it can help with your symptoms and protect
your joints from damage.

Medicines for rheumatoid arthritis work best if you start taking them as soon as you
start having symptoms. You might need to keep taking treatment for the rest of your
life. You might also need to take extra medicines when you have a flare-up of symptoms.


Drugs to slow down the damage to your joints
Medicines that help protect your joints from damage are called disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs or DMARDs for short. They also help with the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, such as pain,
but they might take a few months to start working.

Methotrexate is usually the first DMARD people are prescribed but there are others. These usually
come as tablets. But methotrexate can also be given as an injection.

If your rheumatoid arthritis is fairly mild you might need to take only one of these
drugs. If this doesn't help enough, your doctor might recommend taking two or three
of these medicines together. Your treatment might vary over time depending on your
symptoms.

For more severe rheumatoid arthritis your doctor might recommend taking methotrexate
as well as a newer type of disease-modifying drug called a biologic drug. These drugs are given as an injection or directly into a vein through an intravenous
infusion (also known as an IV or a drip).

All of these treatments can have side effects. Your doctor should explain these to
you. You will have regular check-ups to make sure your treatment is working and to
keep an eye out for side effects. If you do get problems your doctor will help you
switch to a different drug or combination of drugs.

Corticosteroids
Your doctor might also recommend taking drugs called corticosteroids to help reduce
the pain and swelling of rheumatoid arthritis.

These medicines are often called steroids for short, but they aren't the same as the
steroids used by some athletes and bodybuilders. They're similar to chemicals your
body makes naturally to reduce inflammation.

Doctors usually prescribe low doses of corticosteroids, but you might take higher
doses for a short time to help with a flare-up of symptoms.

Most people take corticosteroids as tablets but these medicines can also be given
as injections, sometimes into a joint, to improve symptoms more quickly.

Steroids can cause side effects, including weakened bones, if you take them for a
long time. Your doctor will discuss side effects with you.

If you take corticosteroid tablets regularly your doctor will probably recommend taking
calcium and vitamin D supplements to help protect your bones. You will also have regular
tests to check on your bones (called bone density tests).

Pain medicines
Disease-modifying drugs and corticosteroids can help with rheumatoid arthritis pain.
But you might also need to take pain medicine sometimes.

Drugs called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) help with pain and inflammation. Some examples are ibuprofen and naproxen.

You can buy low doses of ibuprofen without a prescription. You can also get higher
doses or stronger NSAIDs with a prescription from your doctor. If one NSAID doesn't
work for you, another might.

NSAIDs can upset your stomach. They can also sometimes cause more serious problems,
such as stomach ulcers. Doctors usually recommend taking them with food to reduce
the chance of problems. Your doctor might also suggest you take a drug to protect
your stomach.

You should not take an NSAID called diclofenac if you have heart problems.
Things you can do to help yourself
You might want to try other ways of coping with rheumatoid arthritis pain, as well
as taking medicines.

Some people find that a warm bath or shower helps. Wrapping an ice pack (or a bag
of frozen vegetables) in a towel and putting it on the painful joint might also help.

Exercise can help with pain and stiffness, as long as you do something that doesn't
stress your joints. Swimming can be good. A physiotherapist can help you find exercises
that suit you.

Pregnancy and rheumatoid arthritis
Most drugs for treating rheumatoid arthritis are not safe to take while pregnant.
But most women find that their symptoms are much better during pregnancy. If you have
questions about treatment during pregnancy, talk with your doctor.

What will happen to me?
If your rheumatoid arthritis is treated early with disease-modifying drugs, this should
improve your symptoms and help stop the disease getting worse.

But if you don't have treatment, or if you stop treatment, your disease will probably
progress and damage your joints, which can make everyday tasks difficult.

If your rheumatoid arthritis becomes very advanced it can cause problems with other
parts of your body, such as your heart, lungs, and eyes.

You might find having rheumatoid arthritis a daunting prospect. But treatments can
help you live a full, active life. If you have a flare-up of symptoms there are extra
treatments that can help.

It's also important to get support if you need it. Your family and friends might be

Rheumatic fever is a serious complication that can happen after an untreated bacterial
throat infection (often called ‘strep throat’), usually in children. There is no cure
but treatments can relieve the symptoms and help prevent further problems.
What is rheumatic fever?
Sore throats are rarely serious and often go away by themselves. But infection with
a bacteria called group A streptococcus can be more serious. If it is not treated
with antibiotics it can lead to rheumatic fever.

The symptoms of rheumatic fever are not caused by the infection itself but by the
body’s reaction to it. The immune system, which usually protects us against infections,
attacks some of the body’s own tissues at the same time as it attacks the streptococcus
infection.

This can cause problems with the joints, the brain, the skin, and the heart. Most
of these problems are temporary and will go away by themselves. But if there has been
damage to the heart it is likely to be permanent.

Rheumatic fever can damage the valves in the heart, which means that the heart can’t
pump blood as well as it could before.

Rheumatic fever affects children much more often than adults. And it is most common
where medical treatment is not always easily available and where people live in overcrowded
conditions. It is most common in southern and western Africa, parts of Asia, and South
America. It is rare in in Western countries but it does still happen.

What are the symptoms?
As the name suggests, the main symptom of rheumatic fever is a raised temperature.


Other possible symptoms include:


pain in the joints


chest pain


shortness of breath.


Your doctor will ask about these and other symptoms. He or she should also ask if
your child has recently had a sore throat or scarlet fever.

If the doctor suspects that your child might have rheumatic fever he or she will listen
to your child’s heart for signs of any weakness, unusual heart rhythm, or heart murmurs.


Your doctor might also want to do other tests to check for possible damage to your
child’s heart, such as a chest x-ray, and a blood test to check for streptococcus
infection.

What treatments are available?
Relieving the symptoms
For the first phase of treatment your doctor will probably suggest that your child
is admitted to hospital.

Apart from the damage to the heart, the symptoms of rheumatic fever usually clear
up by themselves after a few weeks. But your doctor will probably recommend treatments
to help your child get better more quickly. The first treatment will be antibiotics
to get rid of the infection.

Your doctor will probably also recommend pain medicine suitable for your child’s age,
to treat the joint pain caused by rheumatic fever. This may be a simple painkiller
such as paracetamol, or an anti-inflammatory such as ibuprofen or naproxen, which
can help reduce any joint swelling as well as pain.

Ongoing antibiotics
People who have had a first episode of rheumatic fever are likely to have more without
treatment. The danger if that happens is that it could cause more heart damage. So
doctors recommend that people who have had rheumatic fever with severe symptoms have
regular treatment with antibiotics, often for many years.

If this applies to your child, he or she will probably need to have an antibiotic
injection every 3 or 4 weeks. Your doctor will discuss with you how this schedule
will work, and what you and your child need to do.

People with less-severe symptoms may only need antibiotic treatment for one year.


Keeping the heart healthy
Unfortunately any damage to the heart caused by rheumatic fever is likely to be permanent.
There is no cure for this damage but there are treatments to help your child stay
as healthy as possible and avoid future heart problems.

These include medicines to help blood flow normally through the heart. Your doctor
may also suggest medicines called diuretics to help get rid of any excess fluid that
can build up around the heart with heart failure.

Some people have damage that is so mild that they don’t need any medicine to help
their heart.

Sydenham's chorea
Sydenham’s chorea is a complication that can affect some children after rheumatic
fever. It affects the nerves, causing episodes of jerking movements, usually of the
hands, feet, and face.

Sydenham’s chorea usually goes away after a few weeks or months. Most children don’t
need any medical treatment, just reassurance and support, and a calm, quiet environment
where they can rest and relax.

For children with severe symptoms of Sydenham’s chorea, or with symptoms that last
a long time, medicines can help. But these are usually a last resort as they can cause
side effects.

What to expect in the future
With treatment the symptoms of rheumatic fever usually clear up after a week or two.
Most people can leave hospital within two weeks.

Your child will need to have blood tests for a while until the signs of the infection
are gone. This will probably be twice a week to begin with, then gradually less often.
Your child may also need check-ups with a specialist heart doctor (a cardiologist),
every six months to start with, then every one or two years after that.

The danger of rheumatic fever is not the fever itself, but the possible heart damage
if your child has another episode in the future. For the best chance of preventing
another attack it’s important to stick to the long-term antibiotic treatment that
your doctor recommends.

Streptococcus is a common infection of the mouth and throat. So children who have
had rheumatic fever need to take special care of their oral health. This means:



Cleaning teeth carefully and regularly


Not delaying treatment for any dental or oral problems


Not missing scheduled dental appointments, and


Making sure sore throats are treated early.


Some people who have had rheumatic fever need to have antibiotics before any major
dental work. So make sure you tell the dentist that your child has a history of rheumatic
fever."

Bringing up food is common in babies and very young children. You may hear this called
reflux. It usually doesn't cause problems and most children grow out of it by the
time they are 18 months old. But if it happens frequently or causes problems, your
child may need treatment.

You can use our information to talk to your doctor and decide which treatments are
right for your child.

What is reflux in children?
Reflux happens when partly digested food comes up the oesophagus (the tube that links
the mouth to the stomach).

A muscle at the bottom of the oesophagus, where it joins the stomach, usually stops
food from coming back up. In babies, this muscle may not work properly because their
digestive system is still developing.

When food goes up into the oesophagus, it's often mixed with stomach juices, which
are acidic. This can make the oesophagus sore and inflamed. When reflux is causing
problems, doctors may call it gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, or GORD.

What are the symptoms?
The most obvious symptom of reflux in babies and very young children is bringing up
food. This isn't usually a problem, unless they bring up a large amount of most feeds.

Children with reflux may get other symptoms, which should be checked out by a doctor.
These include:



stomach pain. This can make children irritable, and they might cry or arch their backs
a lot



projectile vomiting. If your child brings up vomit that looks like coffee grounds,
talk to you your doctor. This could be a sign of bleeding in the stomach or oesophagus



children not growing and developing as they should.


There are many possible reasons for these symptoms besides reflux. Your doctor can
check if it's reflux by examining your child and asking you questions about their
symptoms.

It may help if you keep a diary of how much food your child takes, and how often they
bring up food.

Your doctor might also ask to observe your child feeding. You may also need to weigh
your child regularly, or have them weighed at their doctor's clinic, to check whether
they are gaining weight.

A few children need to see a specialist, who may do further tests.
What treatments work?
Reflux is common in babies and very young children. Most children won't need treatment,
but taking simple steps may lessen their reflux. Doctors sometimes recommend:



lying your baby on their stomach or left side after feeding. This might help reduce
reflux. But you should only put your child in these positions when they are awake
and being closely watched. Putting your child in an upright position after they feed
might also help



giving babies smaller, but more frequent, feeds - but only if your doctor thinks their
reflux may be related to overfeeding.



If your child has more severe or frequent symptoms, the following treatments may help.


Products to add to your baby's food
Using products to thicken your baby's food may make them less likely to bring it back
up. You can get products to add to formula or expressed breast milk, or use ready-thickened
feeds.

Thickeners are made out of different substances, including:


rice cereal


carob-bean gum, and



carob-seed flour.


You will probably need a bottle teat with a wider hole when using thickeners.
You may be able to get thickeners on prescription from your doctor, or from your pharmacy.
It's always best to talk to your doctor before changing your baby's feed.

Babies are more likely to cough while taking thickened feeds. Also, you need to check
that your child doesn't put on too much weight. Some thickened feeds have more calories.

Another thickening option are alginates, which can be mixed with a baby's feed or dissolved in water after their meal. Besides
thickening a baby's feed, alginates stop acid and food from going back into the oesophagus.

Alginates don't normally cause side effects, but you should talk to your doctor before
using this treatment. Also, you shouldn't use alginates if you're already using another
type of food thickener.

Medicines
Medicines aren't used very often for reflux in very young children. But your doctor
may recommend them if your child:



is not gaining enough weight


is in considerable distress, or


has difficulties feeding.


H2 blockers and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) reduce the amount of acid in the stomach. They are often used to treat indigestion
in adults.

You can buy some of these medicines at the pharmacy. But you should ask your doctor
before giving these medicines to your child. They can sometimes cause side effects.

Other treatments
If your child isn't gaining enough weight, and other treatments for reflux haven't
helped, your doctor may recommend a feeding tube. This delivers nutrient-rich liquid feedings directly into your child's stomach.

The tube is usually inserted into a child's nostril and threaded down their oesophagus
and into their stomach.

If your child has severe problems with reflux, and other treatments haven't helped,
your doctor may suggest surgery, but this is not common.

The operation strengthens the valve between the child's oesophagus and stomach. It's
called fundoplication. Having an operation always carries a risk of problems, such as infection or blood
clots.

What will happen?
Most children stop bringing up their food by the time they are 18 months old. And
most children don't need treatment.

It's very rare for reflux to lead to more serious problems. But it can sometimes cause:


bleeding in the oesophagus


a painful oesophagus


breathing problems, such as coughing and wheezing


failure to grow and develop at the usual rate for a child's age.


If you have any questions or concerns about your child's reflux or other symptoms,
see your doctor."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1560902204230/Raynaud%27s%20phenomenon,Raynaud's phenomenon,"Raynaud's phenomenon Last published: Sep 03, 2019
Raynaud's phenomenon is a condition that can suddenly cut off the blood flow to parts
of your body, usually your fingers and toes, for short periods of time.

What is Raynaud's phenomenon?
If you have Raynaud's phenomenon your fingers, toes, and other parts of your body
suddenly become numb, white, and cold.

This happens when small blood vessels in your fingers and toes become narrow, which
stops your blood flowing through them normally. These attacks usually happen during
cold weather, but some people get attacks if they feel upset or stressed. Just a small
change in temperature can trigger an attack.

Raynaud's is more common in women than in men.
It's not clear what causes Raynaud’s in most people. But some people get it as a result
of another illness, such as other problems with blood vessels, or an immune system
illness called lupus.

People who work with vibrating tools, such as road diggers, also have a greater chance
of getting Raynaud's phenomenon.

This information is about treating Raynaud’s phenomenon that is not connected to a
more serious condition.

What are the symptoms?
Having Raynaud's phenomenon is not the same as just having cold hands. During a Raynaud's
attack some or all of your fingers suddenly go very pale. There will be a clear division
between the normal-coloured skin and the very pale skin.

This may also affect your toes, ear lobes, and nose (and more rarely your tongue and
nipples). Your fingers will feel cold and they might tingle and feel numb or painful.


Because your fingers aren't getting enough oxygen they may then turn blue. As the
blood returns to your fingers they turn very red and may throb and hurt. The attack
can last for anything from a few minutes up to a few hours.

Raynaud's phenomenon can be painful and worrying but it is usually not serious. The
symptoms should disappear completely after each attack.

What treatments work?
Keeping warm is the best way to prevent attacks. Medicines can help if your symptoms
are severe.

Things you can do for yourself
Keeping warm is the best thing you can do to prevent Raynaud's attacks. You need to
keep your whole body warm to stop your fingers and toes over-reacting to the cold.
Here are a few ideas:



Wear layers of loose-fitting clothing


Wear hats and mittens in cold weather


Keep your feet dry


Wear gloves or socks (or both) in bed during winter


Use portable heating aids and warmers for your hands and feet if you need to stay
outside for a long time.



Also, remember that air conditioning can make rooms very cool.
During an attack, warm your hands, feet, or the affected parts of your body by going
indoors. You can use warm water to help warm up the affected parts.

If you are a smoker it's important to stop. The chemicals in tobacco may make your
symptoms worse.

If you are taking medicines to treat another condition, ask your doctor if any of
them might make Raynaud's worse.

You can also try learning to control stress, especially if your attacks start when
you are upset or stressed.

Ibuprofen or paracetamol can help with the pain.
Medicines
People don't usually need medicines to treat Raynaud's unless their symptoms are severe.
Medicines can help reduce the number of Raynaud’s attacks you get, or make them less
severe. These include medicines called calcium channel blockers, a type of medicine
that's also used to treat heart problems.

If calcium channel blockers don't work, or if you can't take them for some reason,
there are other medicines that your doctor can prescribe.

Common side effects for the drugs used for Raynaud's phenomenon include flushing and
feeling light-headed. Less common side effects include puffy feet or heart palpitations.

What will happen to me?
While Raynaud's can be uncomfortable, it's not serious for most people.
If your symptoms are mild then you probably won't need to take medicine. But you may
need to have tests to see if having Raynaud's phenomenon is linked to another condition.
If your symptoms are more severe, there are medicines that can help."

A pulmonary embolism is a blockage in the main blood vessel that takes blood to your
lungs. It is a medical emergency that needs to be treated as quickly as possible.

What treatments work?
The pulmonary artery is the main blood vessel that carries blood from your heart to
your lungs. If it becomes blocked by a blood clot this is called a pulmonary embolism
(PE). This can be life threatening, as it can stop blood from reaching your lungs.


The blood clot that usually causes a PE doesn’t actually form in the pulmonary artery.
Instead it forms in one of the deep veins in one of your legs. This is called deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

The blood clot then travels through your blood vessels to the pulmonary artery where
it gets trapped. This can stop some or all of the blood that travels through this
artery from reaching the lungs.

The main treatment for PE is anticoagulant medicines. Anticoagulants are drugs that
stop the blood from clotting too easily. But you will probably need some other treatment
first.

Oxygen
If you are having trouble breathing as normal, you will probably be given oxygen to
breathe in through a mask. If you are having severe difficulty breathing, your doctor
might suggest that you use a ventilator to help you breathe.

A ventilator is a machine that helps you breathe if your lungs are struggling to do
the work by themselves. You can use it with a mask, or with tubes that go into your
nose.

Treatments for low blood pressure
Some people who have a PE have blood pressure that is too low. There are several treatments
your doctor might suggest, including:



intravenous (IV) fluids for rehydration


drugs called vasopressors to boost blood pressure, and


adrenaline to help your heart pump your blood more easily.


Medicines to stop your blood clotting too easily (anticoagulants)
The blood’s ability to coagulate (form clots) is important. It means that wounds can
heal quickly without too much loss of blood or too much risk of infection. But if
you have a PE you need to slow down this clotting until the clot that’s causing the
blockage in your artery can dissolve.

If your doctor suspects that you have had a PE he or she will recommend that you start
taking an anticoagulant medicine straight away, even if the results of your tests
haven’t come back yet. This is because it’s important to start treatment as soon as
possible.

If tests then show that you haven’t had a PE, you can stop anticoagulant treatment
and there are usually no ill effects. If you have had a PE you will need to keep taking
the anticoagulant tablets for at least three months.

The main side effect of these drugs is unwanted bleeding, especially in your stomach.
Your doctor will want to check on you regularly to make sure you are not having any
problems.

You may have heard of an anticoagulant drug called warfarin. These days it isn’t used
as much as it used to be, as newer anticoagulant drugs are more suitable for many
people.

But if you need to take warfarin you will need to have your blood tested regularly
to make sure you are taking the right dose. Too much of the drug can cause unwanted
bleeding, and not enough means that the drug isn’t doing its job.

Medicines to dissolve blood clots
If you have had a PE that is causing a major blockage in your pulmonary artery your
doctor might recommend a treatment called thrombolysis. This is done with medicines
that dissolve blood clots.

This treatment is given by intravenous (IV) drip. It takes about two hours. You may
need more than one session. This treatment can sometimes cause side effects, including
dangerous bleeding in the brain. So doctors only recommend it if you have a major
blockage.

This treatment is not suitable for everyone, because of the risk of unwanted bleeding.
For example, you may not be able to have this treatment if:



you have ever had a stroke


you have recently had problems with bleeding in your stomach


you are a woman who has given birth within the last week, or


you have a history of unusual bleeding.


Surgery
Surgery to remove the blood clot is not usually used to treat PE. But your doctor
might suggest it if you have a severe blockage of the pulmonary artery and you can’t
have thrombolysis.

What will happen?
Most people recover well from a PE. But it can be fatal. About 10 in 100 people who
have a serious PE die from it. For people who have a PE that is not considered severe,
this number is about 1 in 100.

Most people who have a PE can leave hospital within a few days. But you will need
to have regular checks with your doctor.

You might think that you should rest after having a PE. But it’s important to keep
as active as possible, in line with your doctor’s advice. Keeping your heart and circulation
working well can help prevent future problems."

The blood clot then travels through your blood vessels to the pulmonary artery where
it gets trapped. This can stop some or all of the blood that travels through this
artery from reaching the lungs.

The DVT that causes a PE is usually caused by a combination of three things:


Damage to the walls of blood vessels. Blood can then stick to these rough, damaged surfaces and form clots. Damage to
blood vessels can be caused by several things, including an injury or previous surgery.




Poor blood flow. When blood is flowing sluggishly through blood vessels it’s easier for clots to
form. Several things can cause poor blood flow, including lack of exercise, older
age, and heart failure.



Having blood that clots (coagulates) very easily. Many things can cause this, including being pregnant, being very overweight, and
the genes you inherit from your parents.



Having some types of surgery can make DVT more likely, especially if you will be unable
to move much for a while after the operation. If you have some types of operation
your doctor might recommend that you take medication to reduce the chance of DVT.


DVT can also develop during long flights, when people don’t move for long periods.
If you are on a flight that is likely to take more than a few hours, make sure you
stay hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids, and flex your legs regularly to keep the
blood moving.

What are the symptoms?
The symptoms of PE are similar to those of many other conditions, so your doctor won’t
be able to diagnose PE just from your symptoms. You’ll need some tests, such as a
chest x-ray and an electrocardiogram (ECG), to confirm exactly what is causing your
symptoms. You may also need to have blood tests and a computerised tomography (CT)
scan.

If you have a PE the symptoms will probably come on very quickly. The most common
symptoms of PE are:



chest pain


difficulty breathing


a sense of apprehension (severe worrying)


fast breathing


coughing


fever


increased heart rate, and


feeling faint.


If you develop sudden chest pain and difficulty breathing, get medical help straight
away.

https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/3000148/Psychosis,Psychosis,"Psychosis Last published: Mar 14, 2022
Psychosis happens when part of the brain isn’t working as it should. This can cause
disturbing and frightening symptoms, including hallucinations.

Psychosis is not a condition, but a symptom that can be caused by many things, including
physical and mental illnesses, medications, and recreational drugs. Treatment for
psychosis depends on what has caused it.

What is psychosis?
Psychosis is caused by problems in the front part of the brain. When this part of
your brain stops working as it should, the way you see and think about the world changes,
sometimes in extreme ways. Psychosis can involve:



hallucinations - seeing, hearing, and even thinking you can touch things that aren’t
real



delusions - believing things about yourself, other people, and the world, that aren’t
true



'catatonic' behaviour - hardly speaking, moving, or reacting at all to the world around
you.



confused thoughts and actions, and


personality changes.


Psychosis can be frightening for you and the people around you, and it’s important
to get help as soon as possible. Some people with psychosis can be a danger to themselves
and to others.

What can cause psychosis?
It’s important to remember that having an episode of psychosis is not always a sign
of a mental-health condition. Many things can cause spells of psychosis.

To get an organised and helpful picture of these many possible causes of psychosis,
doctors divide them into primary and secondary causes.

A primary cause of psychosis is a mental illness that has psychosis as a symptom, either all
the time, or for short periods. For example, schizophrenia has psychosis as a main
symptom.

A secondary cause of psychosis is something that can sometimes cause psychosis, perhaps as a side
effect or by accident, but where psychosis isn’t a main (or primary) part of that
problem. For example, some types of poisoning can cause temporary psychosis: but the
real problem is the poisoning, not the psychosis.

The primary causes of psychosis include conditions such as:



schizophrenia


delusional disorder


brief psychotic disorder


depression, and


bipolar disorder.


The secondary causes of psychosis include:



recreational drugs, including cocaine, cannabis, and alcohol




some prescription medications




some over-the-counter medications




some neurological (nervous-system) illnesses, including epilepsy




some physical illnesses, including thyroid problems, Cushing’s syndrome, some sexually
transmitted infections (STIs), and a virus called Epstein-Barr





injuries to the front part of the brain




delirium




some types of vitamin deficiency




some rare genetic conditions




contact with some toxic chemicals such as some weed killers and fertilisers




exposure to some heavy metals, such as mercury and lead.


Below, we look at some of these secondary causes of psychosis in a little more detail.
Psychosis caused by medicines or recreational drugs
Drugs, both medical and recreational, are a common cause of psychosis.
Recreational drugs that can sometimes cause psychosis include cocaine, cannabis, amphetamines, phencyclidine
(PCP), alcohol, inhalants (solvents such as glue, aerosols, gases, and nitrites).


These drugs usually only cause psychosis in high doses. Sometimes the psychosis happens
from taking a drug once, and is short lived, and sometimes it is caused by withdrawal
from the drug. This often happens with alcohol.

Psychosis can also be caused by long-term use of some drugs, such as cannabis.
Prescription drugs that can trigger psychosis include:



anticholinergics. These drugs are used to treat a variety of problems that involve
muscle spasms, including overactive bladder, Parkinson’s, and chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD)





dopamine agonists, which are used to treat conditions including Parkinson’s and ADHD






corticosteroids, which are strong anti-inflammatories, and




thyroid hormones, which are used to treat an underactive thyroid.


Some over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements can also sometimes cause psychosis. These include:



dextromethorphan, which is in some cough medicines




antihistamines, which are used to treat allergies, and




herbal remedies that contain the traditional ingredient ephedra. Ephedra is banned
in some countries, including the US, and is only available in small doses in some
other countries.



Rarely, some other medications can cause psychosis as a side effect. They include
some antibiotics and antivirals, and a medicine called isotretinoin, which is used
to treat severe acne.

Psychosis linked to problems with the nervous system
Conditions that affect the body’s nervous system (called neurological conditions)
can sometimes cause psychosis. These include:



epilepsy


head injuries that affect the brain


multiple sclerosis


brain tumours


dementia, and


Fahr's disease, a condition where there is too much calcium in parts of the brain.


Psychosis caused by infections
Some infections can cause swelling in the brain. This swelling can sometimes cause
psychosis. These infections include:



some STIs, including herpes, HIV, and chlamydia


measles


mumps


the Epstein-Barr virus, which causes most cases of glandular fever, and




rabies.


Other things that can cause swelling in the brain that can lead to psychosis include
infection with some parasites, including malaria, and some fungal infections.

Psychosis caused by delirium
Delirium can be caused by many things, including low blood sugar, alcohol withdrawal,
lack of oxygen, and some infections. It is more likely to affect people who are seriously
ill and older people.

Psychosis linked to auto-immune diseases
The immune system is supposed to protect us against infection. But sometimes it attacks
some of the body’s own tissues. This is called an auto-immune condition.

Some auto-immune conditions appear to be linked to psychosis in some people. They
include coeliac disease and intestinal malabsorption, where the intestine doesn’t
absorb nutrients from food properly.

What treatments work?
Psychosis is a symptom, not an illness in itself. So the best way to treat it is to
treat the problem that is causing it.

For example, if you have a medical condition that is causing psychotic episodes, then
you will need treatment for that condition.

And if you are taking medication that is causing psychosis, then you and your doctor
will need to discuss what other treatments that you can try that won’t give you problems.


If your psychosis has been caused by drug use, you might need help to stop using drugs.


Psychosis from many causes can be treated successfully. But psychosis caused by psychological
problems, such as schizophrenia, can be harder to treat.

For conditions like schizophrenia, your treatment will probably involve medications
called antipsychotics. You can talk with your doctor about these drugs, how they might
help you, and which one might be best for you.

What will happen?
If you see a doctor and you have symptoms of psychosis, the doctor will want to find
out what is causing your symptoms.

So he or she will examine you physically, check through your medical history, and
ask you (and if possible, someone who has come with you) questions about what might
be causing your problems.

Your doctor will want to know about things like:


any medical conditions you suffer from


whether you have a history of mental-health problems


what medications you take


whether you have taken any recreational drugs, either recently over the long term


any recent head injuries, and


whether you have had contact with any toxic chemicals.


You might have blood and urine tests, to check for drugs, medicines, and other toxic
substances.

Your doctor’s first concern will be to keep you safe. This might mean identifying
any toxic substance you have taken, either deliberately or by accident, and getting
a clear picture of your medical history.

But it might also mean that you need to be kept in hospital for a while, even if you
don’t want to. Your doctor can make this decision against your will if you are thought
to be a danger to yourself or others.

This might be for several reasons. For example, you might be:


unable to look after yourself


aggressive


having severe delusions or hallucinations: for example, if you are hearing voices
telling you to do things



behaving very strangely


behaving in a way that suggests that you might try to kill yourself or someone else.


If you are hospitalised in this way for a while, you might need to be given medication
to keep you calm and safe. Again, you might not want this medication. But your doctor
can override your wishes to keep you and others safe until you are feeling better."

Someone who has psychogenic polydipsia feels unusually thirsty and drinks fluids to
the point where it can be dangerous. But this thirst happens for psychological reasons
(it’s 'all in the mind'), and not because someone is actually dehydrated and needs
fluids.

Psychogenic polydipsia is often a feature of mental-health conditions where people
have trouble telling what is real from what is imagined. Drinking a lot of fluids
can seem reassuring to people in those situations.

If you or someone you care for are affected by this condition, you can use our information
to talk to your doctor about the best treatments.

What is psychogenic polydipsia?
Having polydipsia means that someone is extremely thirsty and drinks excessive amounts
of fluid.

With psychogenic polydipsia (PPD), the cause of this thirst is psychological, not
physical. This means that someone thinks they are thirsty and dehydrated when they
are not.

Drinking too much water may sound harmless, but it can cause a serious problems including:


dangerously low levels of salt in your body. This is called hyponatraemia. It can cause confusion, extreme tiredness, and changes in personality. Extremely
low salt levels can cause seizures, coma, and even death



Water intoxication. Having too much water in your body can cause swelling in the brain, which can lead
to coma and even sudden death



Loss of bladder control


Swollen kidneys


Kidney failure


Heart failure, and


Weak bones.


What causes psychogenic polydipsia (PPD)?
PPD tends to be caused by certain mental-health conditions or by anxiety. For example,
the people most likely to be affected are people who have:



Mental-health conditions that include issues with psychosis. Someone with psychosis
is not always able to tell what is real from what is imagined. For example, people
with psychosis often see and hear things that aren’t there



What doctors call developmental disorders, including autism and Kleine-Levin syndrome, a condition that can cause extreme changes in behaviour



Problems with anxiety. This can affect anyone, but it seems more common in middle-aged
women who have what doctors call anxiety disorders


Anorexia nervosa, and


Personality disorders.


PPD, and the low-salt problems caused by PPD, also seem to be more common in people
who smoke.

We’re not sure why people with these conditions start to drink a lot of fluids. But
it is possible that they somehow find it reassuring, or that they see it as a way
of reducing stress. Some people may see it as a way of diluting the effects of their
medications.

What are the symptoms?
The main symptoms of PPD are:


Being unusually thirsty, and


Frinking large amounts of water or other fluids.


The symptoms of hyponatraemia (low salt levels) caused by PPD include:


Headache


Nausea


Cramping


Weak muscles that don’t respond to physical stimulation, such as touch


Strained or slurred speech


Lethargy (feeling weak and tired)


confusion, and


Seizures.


If salt levels become extremely low, it can cause coma and sudden death.
If you are being treated by a doctor who thinks that you are showing signs of PPD
and hyponatraemia, you may need to have urine and blood tests.

What treatments are available?
Short-term treatments
The longer-term aim of treatment for PPD is to treat the problem that’s causing someone
to think that they need to drink so much.

But the short-term problems need to be treated first. This means:


Stopping the person from drinking too much fluid until their fluid and salt levels
return to normal, and



Treating their salt levels if they are too low.


Low salt levels can be treated with saline (weak salt water) given directly into a vein. But, because this means putting more
fluid into the body, the person should be monitored closely to see that they’re not
given too much fluid.

If you are treated for PPD in this way, you may also be given medicines called diuretics, to help you lose excess fluid quickly. These drugs make you urinate (pee) more than
normal.

Longer-term treatments
Some people can be treated quickly simply with medicines. For example, if someone
is suffering from psychosis, the right antipsychotic medicines should relieve the psychosis and the PPD.

But it’s not always this simple. Some people’s problems can’t be easily treated with
medicines, and they need longer-term help to change their behaviour.

Doctors use various longer-term methods to help people with PPD. Some of these methods
are used together. These include:



Giving rewards for not drinking too much


Helping with ways to cope when someone feels the urge to drink a lot


Encouraging the person to keep a diary of when and how much they drink, and why


Discussing the fears and beliefs that make someone think they need more fluids, and


Helping people to learn self-control. For example, someone may be given a reasonable
amount of water to last them a day. They are then helped to understand how to make
it last by drinking it steadily in small amounts, and by doing things to distract
themselves when they feel the urge to drink to excess.



These treatments can take time, and some people need a lot of help to learn to control
their fears and urges. People who continue to drink at dangerous levels may sometimes
need to be confined to an area where they can’t get access to fluids.

What to expect in the future
If you have had emergency treatment for PPD, your doctor will want to follow up with
you to check if you need more help, especially if you suffer from psychosis that sometimes
gets worse.

If you live with or care for someone who has problems with PPD, it’s important to
to keep an eye on how they are doing. If someone continues to drink too much fluid
for a long period it can cause serious problems, including:



Bladder damage and kidney failure


Heart failure


Weakened bones leading to fractures


Loss of bladder control, and


Coma and even sudden death caused by low salt.


If you are struggling with PPD yourself, or with someone you live with or care for,
talk to your doctor about getting help."

If you get red patches on your skin covered with silvery scales you may have psoriasis.
There is no cure for psoriasis but there are treatments that can help control it.


We've brought together the best and most up-to-date research about psoriasis to see
what treatments work. You can use our information to talk to your doctor and decide
which treatments are best for you.

What treatments work?
The aim of treatment for psoriasis is to get the condition under control as much as
possible. This means reducing how much of the body is affected by plaques, and reducing
the number of skin plaques.

Your treatment will depend on how severe your psoriasis is. And treatments that work
well for someone else may not work as well for you. So you may need to try a few before
you find what works best for you.

Whatever treatments you have, you should have check-ups with your doctor every 3 to
6 months, to monitor how well your treatment is working.

Treatments for mild psoriasis
If your psoriasis is mild, a cream or ointment may be all the treatment you need.
There are several types that you can try.

For mild psoriasis that flares up occasionally your doctor might recommend a steroid cream. The full name of this type of steroid is corticosteroid. Corticosteroids work by
reducing inflammation. These creams can work well for mild psoriasis, but they are
not suitable for longer-term use as they can cause side effects, including thinning
of the skin.

You can buy low-dose steroid creams from a pharmacy. But it's best to talk to your
doctor about this treatment. They can give you advice on using steroids and can prescribe
stronger creams if you need them.

Steroid creams are often recommended to be used alongside creams called vitamin D analogues, as this combination seems to be more effective in many people than just using either
treatment on its own.

If you find that your skin reacts badly to steroids or vitamin D analogues you could
try moisturisers such as Vaseline or E45 cream.

Unlike steroid creams, vitamin D analogues are suitable to be used by themselves for
longer-term treatment of psoriasis that is under control.

You may have heard of coal tar cream being used to treat psoriasis. But it is not used as much as it used to be,
as it is messy and less effective than newer treatments. There are also concerns that
using it to treat psoriasis for long periods could cause cancer.

Dithranol is another cream treatment that has fallen out of favour because of concerns about
side effects, and because it seems less effective than newer treatments. If your doctor
suggests coal tar or dithranol they should explain why.

Treatments for moderate to severe psoriasis
If your symptoms are more severe you will probably see a skin specialist (dermatologist).
Several types of medication can help with moderate to severe psoriasis, and you may
be able to take them in combination with some of the creams and ointments described
above.

Light treatment (phototherapy)
The first thing your specialist might recommend is treatment with light (called phototherapy).
This treatment involves using a machine that's a bit like a sunbed, which gives off
ultraviolet (UV) light.

This treatment helps reduce symptoms in many people. It's often used alongside drug
treatments for the best results. You will have to go to a hospital or specialist clinic
to have this treatment. The amount of treatment you have will be carefully regulated,
as too much UV light can lead to skin cancer in some people.

Many people also find that ordinary sunlight helps with their symptoms. But it's important
to use sunscreen to protect parts of your skin that aren't affected by psoriasis and
to avoid sunburn.

Oral drug treatments (tablets)
There are several medications that can help control psoriasis symptoms, but they can
all cause side effects, some of them serious. Your doctor will try to balance the
benefit you get from the drugs against their potential to cause you harm. So he or
she will probably start you on a low dose of a particular drug and step up treatment
as necessary.

One medication that works well in many people with moderate to severe psoriasis is
methotrexate. It helps to reduce skin inflammation (swelling and redness) and stop plaques from
spreading. But it can cause side effects, including liver damage. If you have this
treatment your doctor should monitor you carefully. Pregnant women should not take
methotrexate as it can harm unborn babies.

A drug called apremilast can help reduce symptoms in some people. It doesn't seem to work as well as methotrexate,
but it is less likely to cause side effects.

Drugs called retinoids work for some people, by regulating the growth of new skin cells. Like methotrexate
they can harm unborn babies. They are not recommended at all for use in women of child-bearing
age. These drugs can also cause other side effects, so your doctor should monitor
you carefully if you take them.

A drug called ciclosporin can work very well to control symptoms. But it is usually only used for a few months
at a time and in people with very severe symptoms. This is because it can cause severe
side effects, including kidney damage and raised blood pressure.

'Biological' drug treatments
Unlike most traditional medications, which are made from chemicals, biological drugs
are made from living cells. They are able to target specific problems in the body
in the way that many traditional drugs are not. So the hope is that they cause fewer
side effects.

Biological drugs seem to work well against psoriasis in many people. However, although
they are widely used to treat psoriasis in some countries, such as the US, in many
other countries, such as the UK, they are only recommended when other treatments haven't
worked.

These medications are given by injection or by intravenous infusion (IV drip). Two
that you may have heard of are etanercept and adalimumab.

Other treatments
Some people try other kinds of treatments to improve their skin, such as acupuncture,
thermal baths (balneotherapy), fish oil supplements, and psychotherapy. But it's not
clear from research whether any of them work.

Where to get more help
Coping with psoriasis from day to day can get you down. It might help to talk to other
people who have the condition. There are charities and support groups in many countries
that can offer many kinds of support. For example, in the UK, the Psoriasis Association
(www.psoriasis-association.org.uk) can put you in touch with local groups, and offer
advice and help."

If you get red patches on your skin covered with silvery scales you may have psoriasis.
There is no cure for psoriasis but there are treatments that can help control it.


What happens?
Your skin is made up of several layers of cells. New cells are constantly being made
to replace the older ones as they die and flake away. The new cells move from the
inside to the outside of your skin. When these cells reach the surface of your skin,
they fall off.

This turnover of skin cells usually takes three to four weeks. But if you have psoriasis
new skin cells take only three or four days to reach the surface. These extra cells
build up and make flaky patches (called plaques) on the surface of the skin. Sometimes
the extra cells can cause severe dandruff on the scalp.

Doctors aren’t sure why psoriasis happens to some people. The genes you get from your
parents may play a part. It's also possible that stress can cause psoriasis to flare
up at times.

You can get different types of psoriasis. This information covers chronic plaque psoriasis. We don't look at treatments for nail or scalp psoriasis, or for other kinds.

Psoriasis is not contagious. So you can’t give it to, or catch it from, anyone else.


What are the symptoms?
Psoriasis patches or 'plaques' are red and covered with silvery scales. They have
clear edges separating them from the surrounding skin. They can be different shapes
and sizes. The patches may be itchy. Sometimes the plaques split and bleed.

Your skin plaques will probably come and go. They may last for a few months at a time,
or they may never really go away. Some people have only two or three patches at a
time, while others have a lot of plaques all over their body.

You may also get some of these symptoms if you have chronic plaque psoriasis:


Changes to your nails. Your nails may look pitted, or separate from the nail bed.
This happens to about a third of people with psoriasis



Painful, stiff joints (arthritis). This happens to up to 10 in 100 people with psoriasis.
It usually affects the joints at the ends of your fingers and toes.



What will happen to me?
Psoriasis is what doctors call a 'chronic' condition. This means that it can last
for a long time, and that it can affect people to some degree for the whole of their
lives. But that doesn't mean it affects everyone all the time: most people with psoriasis
find that it comes and goes.

Psoriasis can be unpleasant and troublesome, but it is not likely to affect your general
health. Most people can control their symptoms with treatment.

For many people with psoriasis the main problem is feeling self-conscious about how
their skin looks. Some people don't want to do things where people can see a lot of
their skin, such as swimming. Some people don't want to go out socially.

It might help to know that hundreds of thousands of people have this condition, and
that many of them have the same feelings about it. Although there is no cure for psoriasis
this condition can be controlled. And you can live life the way you want to.

Where to get more help
Coping with psoriasis from day to day can get you down. It might help to talk to other
people who have the condition. There are charities and support groups in many countries

Prostatitis causes pain and fever in the pelvic area, and can affect men of any age.
This information is about acute prostatitis, which comes on quickly. It is usually
caused by an infection and is treated with antibiotics.
What is prostatitis?
Prostatitis means your prostate gland is inflamed (swollen), usually because of an
infection. The prostate gland is between your bladder and your penis, just in front
of your rectum. The prostate helps to make semen, the fluid that sperm swim in.

There are two types of prostatitis. Acute prostatitis comes on quickly and usually doesn't come back after treatment. Chronic prostatitis is harder to treat. Symptoms may come and go, and their severity may vary over time.

The most common cause of acute prostatitis is infection with bacteria. You are more
likely to get prostatitis if you’ve had a urine infection (also called a urinary tract
infection or UTI) or if you have an enlarged prostate.

What are the symptoms?
The symptoms of prostatitis include:


Pain around your penis, testicles, anus, pelvis, or lower back


A fever


Feeling generally unwell, and


Finding it difficult or painful to pass urine.


Your doctor might examine you by gently placing a gloved finger inside your anus to
feel the prostate. You will probably need to give a urine sample to be checked for
bacteria.

What treatments work?
Drug treatments
You will need to take antibiotic tablets to treat the infection, usually for several
weeks. It is very important to finish the course of antibiotics, even if you start
feeling better before you have taken them all.

Men with signs of very serious infection (sepsis) may need to have antibiotics through
an intravenous (IV) drip directly into the bloodstream. If you need IV antibiotics
you will need to have this treatment in hospital, and you may need to stay in hospital
for a day or so. You will still need to take a course of antibiotic tablets after
the IV treatment.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs for short) such as ibuprofen can help
with pain while the antibiotics are getting to work.

If you are having problems with urination your doctor might prescribe an additional
medication called an alpha-blocker. This should help relax the muscles around the
bladder.

Other treatments
If you are unable to pass urine because of swelling caused by the infection, you may
need to have a tube (called a catheter) inserted for a short while, to drain the urine
from your bladder. This is usually only needed for a short time, until the swelling
goes.

What will happen to me?
Most men with prostatitis get better after taking antibiotics. The infection is treated
and the symptoms go away. But some men go on to get chronic prostatitis. This means
that they continue to get pain and problems with passing urine. This is treated with
a longer course of antibiotics and other medicines."

This information tells you about an operation on the prostate called a transurethral
resection of the prostate (TURP). It explains how the operation is done, how it can
help, what the risks are, and what to expect afterwards.

You can use our information to discuss your operation with the doctors and nurses
treating you.

What is TURP?
If you have a TURP, a surgeon cuts away part of your prostate to stop it pinching
the tube that carries urine from your bladder out through your penis. This tube is
called the urethra.

Your prostate is a gland about the size of a chestnut. It sits under your bladder
and is partly wrapped around your urethra. It makes the milky fluid (semen) that comes
out of your penis when you have an orgasm.

Why might I need TURP?
In many men, the prostate gland gets bigger as they get older. Doctors used to call
this benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH. These days, prostate problems are more often referred to as lower urinary tract symptoms, or LUTS.

BPH or LUTS is not cancer. It is extra growth of normal cells. It’s not clear why
it happens, but it's probably linked to changes in the amount of some hormones in
your body. To find out more, see our information on Enlarged prostate.

An enlarged prostate isn’t usually serious. But it can press on your bladder and your
urethra. This can cause problems when you urinate (pee). You might:



need to strain or push to start urinating


need to urinate a lot more than when you were younger (doctors call this frequency)



need to get up in the night to urinate


suddenly need to urinate urgently (doctors call this urgency)



have a weak flow of urine, or a flow that stops and starts


leak or dribble urine (some men wear pads to keep them dry)


dribble urine when you finish urinating.


Not everyone with LUTS needs TURP. But your doctor might suggest it if:


your urethra is so pinched or blocked that your bladder often doesn't empty completely.
This can cause urinary tract infections (UTIs)


you suddenly have trouble urinating at all. This is called acute urinary retention and can damage your kidneys



your symptoms are causing you a lot of trouble, and drug treatments haven't helped


you have large bladder stones. These can form if your bladder doesn't empty properly.


What will happen?
A TURP takes up to an hour, depending on how much of the prostate needs to be removed.
You'll be given either a general anaesthetic or an epidural (an injection into your
spine).



If you have a general anaesthetic, you’ll be asleep during the operation.



If you have an epidural, the lower part of your body will be numb. You won't be able to see the operation,
but you'll be able to hear what's going on. A nurse or the anaesthetist will probably
talk to you from time to time during the operation, to make sure you’re feeling okay.



The operation goes like this:


Your surgeon will thread a thin tube into the opening of your penis and up your urethra to your prostate.



The tube has a light and a tiny camera on the end. The tube also has a tiny looped wire attached to it. The whole instrument is called a resectoscope.



The looped wire is heated with an electric current and used to cut away the part of
your prostate that's blocking your urine. The pieces of prostate are flushed down
the tube with water.



You won't be able to urinate properly straight after the operation because your urethra
will be sore and swollen. So a tube called a catheter is put into your urethra to drain your urine.

The doctor may flush fluid through the catheter into your bladder to help clear any
blood clots. The fluid then drains away with your urine.

You won’t need stitches or dressings after this operation.
What are the risks?
All operations have risks, and your surgeon should discuss these with you before your
procedure.

Anaesthetics are a common cause of side effects. The most common one is feeling sick (nauseous)
for a while after the operation.

Some people have an allergic reaction to the anaesthetic. You should tell your doctor
before the operation if you have any allergies.

Anaesthetics can cause breathing or heart problems. This is serious, but very rare.
Your blood pressure, heartbeat, temperature, and breathing will be closely monitored
during the operation.

Below, we look at some of the other problems (complications) that can happen with
this procedure.

This list might look long, but remember, these are only things that might happen,
not that definitely will happen. Many men have this procedure with no problems at
all.

Problems that can happen during or soon after the operation


Infections are a risk with any operation. If this happens you will need antibiotics.



Some people have heavy bleeding during the operation. If this happens you might need surgery to stop the bleeding.



Some people get a blood clot in a vein in the leg (called deep vein thrombosis or DVT). This is not usually serious
unless a clot travels to your lungs. You might need to wear tight elastic stockings
during the operation to help prevent clots.



Some men get what’s called TURP syndrome. It happens when your body absorbs too much
of the fluid that’s used to rinse your urethra during surgery. It can make you feel
unsteady, confused, and nauseous. It can also raise your blood pressure or cause problems
with your vision. TURP syndrome is easily treated with drugs, and new techniques have
made it less common than it used to be.



Problems that can happen some time after the operation


Dry climax (also called retrograde ejaculation). This affects most men after TURP. It means that, when you have an orgasm, little
or no semen comes out of your penis. You can still get an erection and sex will still
feel the same. But it can affect your ability to father a child. If you are planning
to have children, tell your doctor before you have this operation.



Erection problems. Up to about 10 in 100 men have problems getting an erection after TURP. This is
often temporary but it can be permanent. If you’re concerned about this, talk to your
surgeon before you have the procedure. If erection problems affect you after TURP,
there are medications that can usually help.



Problems controlling your bladder (urinary incontinence). Many men have some urinary incontinence after this operation, but it’s usually temporary.
In a few men, though, incontinence is a long-term problem.



Problems passing urine again. Narrowing of the urethra (called urethral stricture) can happen if the operation leads to scarring in the urethra. This can make it difficult
and painful to pass urine. Some men need to have another operation to treat this problem.



Needing a second operation. In some men the prostate grows again so that they need another TURP a few years
later.



Dying during the operation. As with most surgical procedures, there is a very small
chance of dying during TURP.



What can I expect afterwards?
After your operation, you'll probably feel sore and tired. Painkillers can help with any discomfort. If these don't help enough, tell your nurse. You may
need a higher dose or a different type of painkiller. Being in pain can slow your
recovery.

You'll need to stay in hospital until the tube draining your urine (catheter) is removed. This usually happens in about two or three days.

You might notice that your urine flows faster straight away. But it can take a while.
Some men need to come back to hospital and have the catheter put back in for a day
or two.

When you get home, you might still feel the need to urinate often. This is because
your urethra takes time to heal after the operation. This usually improves over about
six weeks.

You might get a stinging feeling when you urinate, and you might notice some blood
in your urine for a few weeks.

You should be up and about within a week. But it might be two to four weeks before
you can return to work, depending on the job you do.

It will probably be several weeks before you'll feel comfortable enough to have sex. It's also best to avoid strenuous activity, such as sport or heavy lifting, for about six weeks.

Try to drink plenty of water. This helps to flush out any infections."

Prostate cancer is serious, but it often grows slowly. If your prostate cancer is
caught early, you don't have to rush into a decision about treatment.

Here, we look at prostate cancers that have not spread to other parts of the body
(called non-metastatic cancer).

What is prostate cancer?
Your prostate gland sits near your bladder. It makes the fluid that carries sperm
out of your penis when you have an orgasm.

If you have prostate cancer, it means that some of the cells in your prostate gland
have started to grow out of control.

The cancer cells form a lump called a tumour. The tumour can cause problems as it grows, such as difficulty urinating and painful
orgasms.

Cancer cells can also break off the main lump and spread to other parts of your body.
This can be very serious, and even life threatening. However, tumours in the prostate
often grow very slowly. Most men live for many years without getting any symptoms.

Some men are more likely than others to get prostate cancer. You are more likely to
be affected if you:



are older


have Black or African ancestry, or


have a family history of prostate cancer.


It's possible that a high-fat diet might make prostate cancer more likely. But there
isn't much evidence about this.

What are the symptoms?
Symptoms of prostate cancer include:


having problems urinating (peeing), such as having to urinate more often, and needing
to get up during the night to urinate, and



having blood in your urine or semen.


But most men who have problems urinating don't have cancer. The symptoms of prostate
cancer are very similar to the symptoms of an enlarged prostate. An enlarged prostate is not cancer.

You might have heard an enlarged prostate called benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) or lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS).

So these symptoms alone don't mean that you have prostate cancer. For example, even
having blood in your urine could be caused by something else, such as a urinary tract infection (UTI).

If you have these symptoms, though, it's best to have them checked out.
Many men find talking to their doctor about these problems embarrassing. But urinary
symptoms are extremely common, especially in middle-aged and older men. So your doctor
will have plenty of experience of dealing with them.

For most men, having your symptoms checked out just gives peace of mind.
For more information on checking for prostate cancer, and for testing, see our leaflet:
Routine screening for prostate cancer.

What treatments are available?
Prostate cancer is a serious but often curable disease. Even if your cancer has grown
into nearby tissue outside the prostate, your chances of survival are still good.

But prostate cancer cells can sometimes spread to other, more distant parts of the
body.

This spread is called metastasis, and it is a more advanced and serious form of cancer.


Here, we look at treatments for prostate cancer that has not spread to other parts
of the body (non-metastatic cancer).

There are four main treatment options: expectant management, surgery to remove the prostate, radiotherapy, and hormone therapy.

What treatment, or treatments, your doctor recommends will depend on three main things:


How high-risk your cancer is. Your doctor will consider several factors, including how big your tumour is, whether
your cancer has spread (and how far), and whether it appears to be fast-growing.

Based on these things and on the results of tests, he or she will calculate your level
of risk.

If you are in a lower-risk group, one of your treatment options may be to take a wait-and-see
approach and hold off on treatment for the time being (expectant management).



How long you're likely to live (your life expectancy). This is based on your age and your health.

If you are older or if you have other serious health issues, your prostate cancer
may never cause problems in your lifetime and you may decide to hold off on treatment.

But if you are younger and otherwise in good health, there's a higher chance that
your cancer will eventually spread and cause problems. So, your doctor may recommend
having one or more treatments to get rid of the cancer.



Your choices. Your views and preferences play an important role in your treatment.

For example, you may decide you're comfortable living with an untreated cancer if
it means you can avoid the side effects of treatments.

On the other hand, you may decide that getting rid of the cancer is the most important
thing for you, and that you want the most aggressive treatments, regardless of the
possible side effects.

Your doctor will fully explain all your options, and help you make a decision based
on what is most important to you.



Expectant management
Expectant management means that you have regular check-ups rather than treatment.
You may also hear this called 'active surveillance'.

For many men, prostate cancer grows slowly. A wait-and-see approach obviously can't
cure your cancer. But by choosing expectant management, you'll avoid all the side
effects of other treatments.

You can start treatment in the future if your cancer starts to spread. But some men
will live the rest of their lives without needing treatment, especially if they're
older.

If you have expectant management, you will see your doctor regularly - probably at
least every six months - to check on your cancer.

Surgery
Surgery for prostate cancer involves having an operation to remove your prostate gland
and some of the tissue around it. You may also have nearby lymph nodes removed. The
goal is to remove all of the cancer and stop it spreading.

There are a few ways to do the operation. It can be done:


through a large cut in your abdomen


through a cut in the skin between your anus and your scrotum, or


with keyhole surgery (laparoscopic surgery), which is done by inserting tiny tools
through several small cuts.



Having your prostate removed is a major operation. And it's possible for the organs
and nerves close to the prostate to get damaged during surgery.

This can cause problems, such as difficulty controlling the flow of urine.
Although this usually gets better once men have recovered from surgery, some men don't
regain full control. They may, for example, leak some urine when coughing, sneezing,
or exercising.

Some men also have difficulty controlling their bowel movements for a while after
their surgery. Prostate surgery can also make it difficult to get an erection.

Without a prostate, you can still have orgasms but you won't produce any semen when
you ejaculate.

You also will no longer be able to father children through sex. Some men store a sample
of their semen before having their prostate removed, so they can still father children.

As with any major operation, there's a small chance you could die from prostate surgery.
Your doctor will explain the possible risks for you, based on your age and general
health. Your doctor can help you decide if the benefits of surgery outweigh the risks.


Radiotherapy
Radiotherapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill cancer cells. There are two main types
of radiotherapy used for prostate cancer. They are sometimes combined with each other,
or with other treatments.



External beam radiotherapy: a special machine carefully directs radiation into your tumour from outside of your
body.

You lie very still on a table during treatment. One session of treatment usually lasts
around 10 minutes. You'll have treatment five days a week for several weeks.



Brachytherapy: radioactive seeds are implanted in your prostate during a small operation. The seeds
are each about the size of a grain of rice.

If you have low-dose seeds implanted, these can stay inside your body after treatment.
But if you have high-dose seeds implanted, these will need to be removed when treatment
is finished.

Some men prefer brachytherapy over external beam radiotherapy, because they don't
have to repeatedly go to hospital for treatment.



Side effects of radiotherapy include tiredness, bowel problems (such as feeling as
if you need to go to the toilet urgently), and problems when urinating (such as having
a burning feeling or blood in your urine).

These side effects usually go away after treatment ends. But other problems can happen
months or years after radiotherapy, including trouble getting an erection.

Your doctor will provide a complete list of possible side effects.
Hormone therapy
In order to grow, the healthy cells in your prostate gland need the hormone testosterone.
And so do the cancer cells.

So, treatment to reduce or block the testosterone in your body may slow down the cancer.
Hormone therapy isn't usually used on its own for lower-risk prostate cancers. But
your doctor might recommend having it with radiotherapy if your cancer seems likely
to spread.

There are two ways to stop the cancer cells getting testosterone.


You can take drugs that stop your body making testosterone or that block the effect
of testosterone on cells.



You can have surgery to remove your testicles (your testicles make most of the testosterone
in your body).



One advantage of taking drugs to reduce or block testosterone is that you can stop
taking them if they don't help or you don't like the side effects. But the effects
of surgery to remove your testicles are permanent.

Hormone therapy can cause a range of side effects. Your doctor will discuss these
with you in detail.

Examples of possible problems include:


having difficulty getting an erection


getting hot flushes


growing larger, tender breasts


losing some of your hair


gaining weight, and


weakened bones.


What will happen to me?
Prostate cancer is a serious condition. It can be dangerous if it spreads around your
body.

But prostate cancer often grows slowly. Many men live for years without getting any
symptoms, and some men never need treatment.

If you do need treatment, it can work well to get rid of the cancer if it's caught
before it spreads. For example, almost all men who have treatment for early-stage
prostate cancer are still alive 5 years later, and most are still alive 10 years later.

It's hard to say how many are alive after longer than 10 years. Prostate cancer mainly
affects older men, many of whom will die from something else in the meantime.

But treatments do have side effects. Be sure to discuss any concerns or questions
with your doctor. Together, you can decide on a treatment approach that's right for
you."

Last published: May 03, 2022
Primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison’s disease) is a rare condition that affects
the body’s ability to produce certain hormones. It causes extreme tiredness and weakness
and can be life threatening if not treated. But drug treatments can help most people
live a normal life.

What treatments are available?
Primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI) affects two small glands that sit just above the
kidneys called the adrenal glands. These glands produce hormones, including two called cortisol and aldosterone.

PAI used to be called Addison's disease. And this is still the name by which most people know the condition.

If you have PAI these glands are damaged and can’t produce enough of these hormones.
This causes symptoms including extreme tiredness. If left untreated the condition
can be life threatening.

If your levels of cortisol drop to life-threatening levels, this is called an adrenal crisis. During an adrenal crisis the symptoms of PAI you have severe symptoms of PAI. This
is a medical emergency and you need to get medical help straight away.

For more background information, and for information on symptoms, see our leaflet: Primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison’s disease): what is it?
The treatment for PAI is to replace the hormones that the adrenal glands don’t make
enough of.

This is done with medicines called corticosteroids, which mimic the actions of the hormones made by the adrenal glands. You will need
to take them for the rest of your life. You will probably also need to take a medicine
to help with your salt and water balance.

It probably won’t be clear straight away how much of the medicines you need to take,
as it varies from person to person. So your doctor or a specialist nurse will explain
to you how the medicine works and how to increase the dose if your symptoms don’t
go away.

There might also be times in your life when you need to increase how much medicine
you take, such as if:



you have had an infection


you have been doing a lot of exercise, or


you need surgery.


Women might also need to take more of their medicine while pregnant.
If you have any doubts or questions about your medicine dose, talk with your doctor.
If you are diagnosed with PAI during an adrenal crisis you will be given the corticosteroids
by injection until you are stable and can switch to taking tablets.

What to expect in the future
If you have PAI you will need to take your medicine for the rest of your life. Your
doctor will discuss with you how to take your medicine, and about times when you may
need to take more than usual.

Not taking your medicine means that your symptoms will return, and that you could
have an adrenal crisis. So it’s important to always make sure that your supply of
medicines doesn’t run too low.

Once your condition is stable you will need to see your doctor and perhaps a specialist
every year to discuss your condition and how your medicine is working.

There are various things you can do to stay healthy. For example, everyone with PAI
should carry a medical alert card or wear a medical alert bracelet. If you are in
an accident or lose consciousness for any reason, your doctor will then know that
you need your corticosteroid medicine.

You should also keep emergency injections at home in case you lose consciousness or
are in an accident. Family members should be taught how to give you these injections
in case you can’t, because of an adrenal crisis or for any other reason.

It’s important to keep an eye on when your emergency injections are due to reach their
expiry date, so that you get replacements in plenty of time.

You can find training on how to give the injections online. For example, in the UK
the Addison's Disease Self Help Group (addisonsdisease.org.uk) gives advice on this
as well as help and support about all aspects of Addison’s disease."

What is primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease)?
Primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI) is a condition that affects two small glands that

PAI used to be called Addison's disease, and this is probably the name by which most people still know the condition.

If you have PAI these glands are damaged and can’t produce enough of these hormones.
This causes symptoms including extreme tiredness. If left untreated the condition
can be life threatening.

Several things can cause PAI. Finding the cause in each person is important in helping
find the best treatment.

In most people PAI is what’s called an autoimmune condition. This means that the body’s immune system, which usually protects against
infection, attacks some of the body’s tissues instead. In this case the immune system’s
antibodies attack the adrenal glands.

Other, less common, causes of PAI include:


tuberculosis, HIV, and some other infections


cancer


some medicines


bleeding in and around the adrenal glands that destroys them.


People with autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, or
the most common type of hypothyroidism, can develop antibodies against the adrenal
glands. But they usually don't have symptoms.

What are the symptoms?
The main early symptoms of PAI are:


fatigue (tiredness)


loss of appetite, which after a while leads to a lot of weight loss


muscle weakness.


As the condition develops it can cause brownish patches on the skin (called hyperpigmentation), especially on:



areas where the skin creases, such as the palms and knuckles


skin exposed to the sun, and


areas of skin exposed to frequent friction.


Other, less common, symptoms include:


muscle pain


nausea, vomiting, and stomach cramps


a craving for salt


dizziness.


PAI can be hard for doctors to diagnose, especially in its early stages. This is because
symptoms like tiredness and weakness are similar to those of common conditions, such
as flu. As a result, many people are not diagnosed until they have what’s called an adrenal crisis.

During an adrenal crisis your levels of the hormones usually produced by the adrenal
glands have fallen dangerously low and you are seriously ill. An adrenal crisis can
be life threatening.

If your doctor suspects that you have PAI you will need a blood test to check your
hormone levels. But if your doctor suspects that you are having an adrenal crisis
(by which time you will probably already be having emergency treatment in hospital)
he or she will not wait for the results of tests before treating you.

What will happen?
If you have PAI you will need to take your prescribed medicine for the rest of your
life. Your doctor will discuss with you how to take your medicine, and about times
when you may need to take more than usual. For more information see our leaflet: Primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison’s disease): what treatments work?
Not taking your medicine means that your symptoms will return, and that you could
have an adrenal crisis. So it’s important to always make sure that your supply of
medicines doesn’t run too low.

Once your condition is stable (under control) you will need to see your doctor and
perhaps a specialist every year to discuss your condition and how your medicine is
working.

There are various things you can do to stay healthy. For example, everyone with PAI
should carry a medical alert card or wear a medical alert bracelet. If you are in
an accident or lose consciousness (black out) for any reason, your doctor will then
know that you need your corticosteroid medicine.

You should also keep emergency injections at home in case you lose consciousness or
are in an accident. Family members should be taught how to give you these injections,
in case you can’t, because of an adrenal crisis or for any other reason.

https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1182265118525/Preventing%20another%20stroke,Preventing another stroke,"Preventing another stroke Last published: Jul 24, 2020
If you've had a stroke that was caused by a blood clot you might be worried about
having another. But there are treatments that can reduce the chance of this happening.

You can use our information to talk to your doctor and decide which treatments are
right for you.

What is a stroke?
A stroke happens when the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off. It's extremely
dangerous. If brain cells go too long without a supply of blood they will die.

There are two main causes of a stroke.


Haemorrhagic strokes are caused by a broken blood vessel in the brain.


Ischaemic strokes happen when a blood clot gets stuck in a blood vessel in the brain
and blocks the flow of blood. The information in this leaflet is about ischaemic strokes.



It's also possible to have what's called a mini-stroke. A mini-stroke happens when
the blood supply to the brain is cut off for just a few minutes. Doctors call it a
transient ischaemic attack, or TIA.

If you've had a stroke or mini-stroke before it increases your chances of having another
one. You might be at greater risk if:



you're over 75


you have heart failure, diabetes, or high blood pressure


you have a type of irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation.


What treatments help to prevent a stroke?
Your doctor will suggest that you take medicines to reduce your chance of having another
stroke. Some people might also benefit from surgery.

Your doctor will also suggest some changes to your lifestyle to help you stay healthy.
Medicines
Your doctor will probably recommend that you take a type of medicine called an antiplatelet.

Platelets are tiny discs in the blood that join together to form scabs over wounds
when you have an injury. Antiplatelet drugs help reduce your chance of having another
stroke by stopping these platelets clumping together to form clots in your blood vessels.


There are several drugs your doctor might prescribe, partly depending on whether you
have any other heart or circulation problems. But they all work in a similar way.
Two that you may have heard of are aspirin and clopidogrel.

One side effect of these drugs is that they can make you bleed more easily. There's
a small chance that this could cause dangerous bleeding inside your body (internal
bleeding). But if you've had a stroke it's highly likely that the benefits of these
drugs outweigh the risks.

Taking a drug called a statin can also lower your chance of having another stroke. Statins work by lowering cholesterol
levels

Cholesterol is a fatty substance that's found in the blood. Some cholesterol is needed
for good health, but if you have too much of one specific type of cholesterol it can
lead to blocked blood vessels.

Statins can cause side effects in some people, including liver or muscle problems.
Tell your doctor if you notice any muscle pain or weakness or any new symptoms.

What if I have an irregular heartbeat?
Some people who have had a stroke have a type of irregular heartbeat called atrial
fibrillation. If you have atrial fibrillation the treatment you need to prevent another
stroke will be slightly different.

An irregular heartbeat can mean that blood pools in your heart and forms clots. If
a clot travels to your brain it can cause a stroke. So your doctor will probably suggest
that you take an anticoagulant to help prevent blood clots forming in this way.

One anticoagulant you might have heard of is warfarin. But there are several newer
drugs that do the same job. The treatment your doctor suggests will depend on which
one he or she thinks will best suit you and your lifestyle.

One side effect of anticoagulants is that they can make you bleed more easily. This
could lead to dangerous internal bleeding.

If you're taking warfarin you'll have regular blood tests to make sure you're taking
the right dose. You might need to have your dose adjusted depending on the test results.
This reduces your chance of side effects and makes sure you're getting the most effective
treatment. The newer anticoagulants don't require as much testing.

Surgery
Your doctor might recommend surgery if you have a certain level of blockage in the
carotid artery in your neck. An operation called carotid endarterectomy can remove this fatty build-up from the arteries in your neck (these are the arteries
that carry blood to your brain).

If you have this operation you'll have a general anaesthetic to make you sleep. A
surgeon then makes small cuts in the major blood vessels in your neck and removes
any blockages.

It's a serious operation and, like all surgeries, it has risks. It's also not suitable
for everyone. For example, for some people, it could actually increase their chance
of a stroke. Talk to your doctor about whether surgery could be right for you.

Another operation called carotid artery stenting is sometimes used to help prevent another stroke. This uses a tube with a tiny balloon
on the end. The tube is passed through your blood vessels, and the balloon is blown
up to widen any blockages.

This operation is fairly new, so we don't know as much about how well it works as
we do about endarterectomy.

What can I do to help myself?
Making changes to your lifestyle can help lower your cholesterol level and help you
be healthier overall.

Your doctor will probably advise you to do several things. But you'll still need to
take the medicines that your doctor has prescribed.

Everyone who has had a stroke will be strongly advised to exercise several times a week in order to reduce the chance of another stroke.

If you have been partly disabled by a stroke, or if you have lost some mobility, your
doctor should refer you to a physiotherapist or other specialist to help you recover
as much movement as you can.

If you're overweight it's a good idea to try to get to a healthier weight. Doing some
physical activity can help. Doing at least 30 minutes of exercise on most days is
a good target.

Try to choose an activity that makes you warm and slightly out of breath. Many people
find that walking briskly is the most convenient thing to do. But the type of exercise
you can do will depend on how your stroke has affected you, especially at first.

You might want to talk to your doctor about what types of exercise are safest and
best for you.

If you smoke your doctor will strongly advise you to stop or at least to try to smoke less. Smoking
damages your blood vessels and makes a stroke more likely. Your doctor or pharmacist
can give you help with stopping smoking.

(For more information on help to stop smoking, see our leaflet on Stopping smoking.)
It's also important to eat a healthy diet that includes a lot of fresh fruit and vegetables. Try to keep sugar, processed foods,
and junk food to a minimum.

If you have another medical condition, such as high blood pressure or a heart problem,
try to make sure it's kept under control. Not taking your treatments for other conditions
could increase your chance of having another stroke.

Where can I get more help?
Many people who have a stroke have rehabilitation in a specialised stroke facility.
This can help you recover if you have lost some mobility or have trouble communicating.

Some people become depressed after having a stroke. If you begin to feel depressed,
don't keep it to yourself. Depression can slow down your recovery. Tell your doctor
and anyone who is caring for you. There are treatments that can help.

Having a stroke can mean making some big changes to your life. You may find it helps
to talk to people who've been in a similar situation. Or, if you're caring for a relative
who's had a stroke, you may feel you need more advice and support. Your doctor can
give you advice and put you in touch with organisations that can help.

For example, in the UK, the Stroke Association is a charity that offers information
and support to people who've had a stroke and their families. You can find out more
at their website (stroke.org.uk)."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1501234844783/Pressure%20sores,Pressure sores,"Pressure sores Last published: Apr 18, 2019
Pressure sores (you might also hear them called pressure ulcers) tend to happen in
people who are bed bound or chair bound for long periods and have difficulty moving.
Careful nursing and foam mattresses can help prevent pressure sores.

You can use our information to talk to your doctor and decide which treatments are
best for you.

What are pressure sores?
Pressure sores are areas of damaged skin that become open wounds. When you sit or
lie down you naturally shift your position from time to time, even when you're asleep.
But if you can't move yourself because you’re too ill you could get a pressure sore.

Pressure sores start when the weight of your body presses down on the skin underneath
in one place for a long time. This pressure stops your blood circulating properly
through the skin. The skin cells die and the skin breaks down.

Friction from being moved, or from slipping down in bed, can also damage your skin
or cause wounds in areas that are already damaged. Areas of skin over the bony parts
of your body are most at risk because they get the most pressure. Pressure sores can
take a long time to heal.

Anyone who has difficulty moving can get a pressure sore. But you are more likely
to get one if you:



are aged over 70


are immobile (you can't move) and bed bound or chair bound because you are seriously
ill or unconscious



have just had surgery or have been treated in an intensive care unit


are malnourished or are very overweight


have poor blood circulation


have trouble sensing pain (this can happen if your spinal cord is injured or if you
have nerve damage)



have had a pressure sore before.


What are the symptoms?
Like other wounds, pressure sores may hurt, weep, bleed, and get infected.
You are most likely to get a pressure sore where your skin gets squashed between a
bony area and your bed or chair: for example, at the bottom of your backbone, over
your hip bone, or on the back of your heel.

If you are looking after someone who may be at risk of getting a pressure sore you
need to know the warning signs.

You should tell a doctor or nurse immediately if you find any signs of skin damage,
such as a discoloured patch. Other warning signs include:



swelling


blisters


hard or cracked skin


patches of skin that are shiny, too warm, too cold, or too dry.


What treatments work?
Preventing pressure sores
If you are at risk of getting pressure sores you should lie on a special foam mattress
that provides extra support, not on an ordinary hospital or bedroom mattress. This
will spread your weight and protect your skin.

You're much less likely to get a pressure sore if you lie on this type of foam mattress.
They are available in hospitals, in nursing homes, and for use at home.

The best way to prevent a pressure sore is to change your position regularly. If you
can't do it yourself a health professional or your carer should do it for you.

Your skin should be protected during moves so that it doesn't rub or drag along the
mattress.

Inspecting your skin for early warning signs of pressure sores is also important.
You can also help yourself by:


drinking plenty of liquids


eating a healthy diet


stopping smoking.


Treating pressure sores
Dressings
Careful cleaning and dressing of the wound are usually all that's needed to treat
pressure sores.

Dressings are placed directly over your pressure sore to protect it and keep it clean
and moist while it heals.

A nurse should be able to decide on the best type of dressing for you. The ones that
are usually recommended are called hydrocolloid dressings.

Removing dead tissue (debridement)
It's important to keep your pressure sore clean and clear of any dead tissue. Your
nurse will usually be able to do this by gently washing the sore with salt water.

Removing dead tissue that is more stubborn is called debridement. This is usually
only needed for larger pressure sores.

Debridement can be done with:


a blade or sharp knife (a scalpel)


special dressings, or


chemicals.


Pain relief
For painful pressure ulcers, simple painkillers such as paracetamol and ibuprofen
are usually enough. Your doctor can also prescribe pain-relieving creams that you
apply directly around the wound, and dressings that release pain-relieving drugs directly
into the wound.

But some people need stronger pain relief. There are other drugs your doctor can prescribe,
including codeine and morphine. These drugs can be taken as tablets or given as a
drip.

Antibiotics
If you have a pressure sore that becomes infected your doctor might prescribe antibiotics.
If you have signs of local infection (more redness and swelling around the wound than
is usual) but you don't have signs of a general infection, such as a fever, your doctor
will probably suggest antibiotic cream that you apply to the area of the wound.

Good nutrition
If your doctor or nurse thinks you aren't getting enough good nutrition he or she
might offer some advice on nutrition or recommend that you see a dietitian.

They might also suggest that you take nutritional supplements. Getting the right nourishment
makes it much easier for wounds to heal.

Surgery
If you have a deep wound that doesn't seem to be healing your doctor might recommend
surgery to close up the wound.

What will happen to me?
If you discover pressure sores early there's a good chance you can stop them getting
worse.

Most pressure sores heal eventually. But large pressure sores can be hard to treat
and can take time to heal. You might need to spend many months being nursed in hospital
or at home.

If you have had a pressure sore your doctor or nurse should advise you about how best
to avoid it happening again.

Pressure sores usually affect just the skin. But, rarely, pressure also damages deeper
tissues such as muscle. If these tissues die a deep wound appears that may go down
as far as the bone. If this happens your doctor might recommend surgery."

Premenstrual syndrome
Many women feel bloated or tense in the week or so before their period. For some women
it’s just a nuisance. For others, it has a big impact on their lives. But there are
things that can help.

You can use our information to talk to your doctor about the best treatments for you.
What is premenstrual syndrome?
Premenstrual syndrome (PMS, for short) is a name for a group of symptoms that can
happen in the week or two weeks before you get your period. These symptoms start to
improve as soon as your period starts and should be completely over by the time your
period has finished.

Because the symptoms can be quite common (for example, headache), the main thing that
shows they are part of PMS is their timing. If you usually get a number of these symptoms,
always at the same time during your menstrual cycle, you may have PMS. If they are
not linked to this time, treatment for PMS won’t help.

We don’t know exactly what causes PMS. Doctors think that changes in some hormone
levels during the menstrual cycle might affect chemical messengers in the brain called
neurotransmitters. But we don’t know why this happens to some women and not others.

Women with PMS often say that their mothers had it, too. So it may be connected to
genes you inherit from your parents.

What are the symptoms?
Common physical symptoms of PMS include:


feeling bloated


tender breasts


headaches


feeling more hungry than usual, and


feeling more tired than usual.


PMS can also affect you emotionally.


Some women feel tense and irritable.


You might feel unusually emotional: for example, you might cry easily about things
that wouldn't normally make you cry.



Some women feel depressed. If this is affecting your life or if you feel unable to
cope, talk to your doctor.



Your doctor may ask you to keep a diary of your symptoms, recording what happens and when. This can help show whether your
symptoms are caused by PMS.

Women experience the symptoms of PMS in different ways. Some women’s symptoms are
more intense, and they may find it hard to get on with their everyday lives.

For example, they may find it impossible to concentrate at work or get very angry
with family over trivial matters. For other women, PMS is a nuisance but doesn’t have
a big effect on their lives.

What treatments are available?
The treatment for PMS isn't the same for everyone. This is because not everyone gets
all the same symptoms. Your treatment should be tailored to the symptoms that are
affecting you.

Some women find that the only treatment they need to manage their symptoms is to make
some changes to their lifestyle.

For example, your doctor may suggest you try exercising more, as well as trying relaxation techniques. These could be anything from yoga or meditation to just taking time to
listen to music.

Treatments for physical symptoms
If exercise and relaxation haven't worked, there are treatments your doctor may suggest.
You might need one or more of these treatments.

The combined oral contraceptive pill ('the pill’) may help with physical symptoms such as bloating and sore breasts. The
combined oral contraceptive pill is called 'combined' because it contains a combination
of the hormones oestrogen and progesterone.

The pill may appeal to you if you also need contraception. But it’s not appropriate
if you want to get pregnant or if you have certain health problems.

The contraceptive pill has been used since the 1960s and is generally very safe. But
it does have risks, such as increasing the chance of having a blood clot in your leg
(called deep vein thrombosis), which can be dangerous.

Talk to your doctor about whether the contraceptive pill is right for you. There are
different types, so you may find that one suits you better than others.

If the contraceptive pill isn't right for you, your doctor may be able to prescribe
other drugs that can help with physical symptoms.

Your doctor might also recommend medicines called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Examples include ibuprofen and naproxen.

Some of these drugs are available without a prescription. They can help relieve some
symptoms of PMS such as headaches and breast pain. They may also help if PMS affects
your mood.

Treatments for other symptoms
If your symptoms are mainly to do with feeling anxious or emotional, your doctor may
suggest you take antidepressants, either all the time or just in the week or two before your period. Your doctor is
more likely to suggest this treatment if you have moderate to severe PMS.

These drugs have side effects, which your doctor should discuss with you.
If your emotional symptoms are severe your doctor might also suggest drugs that help
with anxiety, called anxiolytics.

Your doctor might also suggest a type of talking therapy, called cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT). Some women find this helps them to manage their symptoms better, and to cope
better with stress. CBT is sometimes also used to help women cope with their physical
symptoms.

Severe PMS that doesn't get better with treatment
If your symptoms are so severe that they are badly affecting your everyday life, and
if they don't get better with any of the treatments mentioned above, your doctor might
suggest surgery to remove one or both of your ovaries. But this will only be an option
if you are not planning on becoming pregnant.

Diet and complementary therapies
There is some evidence that eating a diet rich in complex carbohydrates during your period can help with symptoms. Complex carbohydrates include things like:



whole grains


peas and beans, and


vegetables.


Calcium seems to help some women with PMS symptoms. But you should be careful not to take
too much, as it can cause side effects, including kidney stones and constipation.

Some doctors suggest pyridoxine (vitamin B6). But it isn't clear how well it works.

Some women try acupuncture for PMS. But there isn't much good-quality research about
how well it works.

What to expect in the future
PMS can have a really distressing impact on some women's lives. But treatments and
changes to your lifestyle can help.

It’s important to remember, though, that most treatments for PMS take time to work.
You may need to wait for several months before your symptoms show much improvement.

If you have PMS it is unlikely that your symptoms will stop by themselves, and it
is likely that you will keep having symptoms until the menopause.

Some women find that it helps to get support from other women. For example, in the
UK, pms.org.uk offers information and support on many aspects of PMS.

Your doctor might be able to help you find help where you live, or you can easily
search online."

Pregnant women sometimes go into labour much earlier than expected, which can be dangerous
for their baby. If your labour starts early there are steps your doctor can take to
increase your baby's chances of a healthy start.

You can use our information to talk to your doctor if you want to know more about
premature labour. If you go into labour early your doctor should discuss your options
with you as clearly as possible.

What is premature labour?
Pregnancy normally lasts between 37 and 42 weeks. If you go into labour before the
37th week, this is called premature labour. You may also hear it called preterm labour. When a baby is born before the 37th week this is called a premature (or preterm)
birth.

Sometimes doctors start labour early on purpose because the woman's health, or her
baby's health, is at risk.

Here, though, we talk about preterm labour that isn't planned. This is called spontaneous preterm labour.

Spontaneous preterm labour is sometimes linked to a specific cause, such as a woman's
waters breaking early (this happens when the sac of fluid around a baby, called the
amniotic sac, ruptures early).

But often doctors don't know why a woman goes into preterm labour. However, we do
know that certain things can increase a woman's chance of preterm labour. These are
called risk factors. They include:



having had a preterm labour before


being pregnant with more than one baby


smoking while pregnant


having an infection


having had surgery on your cervix (the cervix is the opening to the womb)


having a cervix that is short (this increases the chance that it will open early,
leading to premature labour)



having had an abortion before.


If you have one of these risk factors this doesn't mean you will definitely have a
premature labour. It just means you have a greater chance than a woman without that
risk factor of having premature labour.

It's also worth noting that women sometimes go into premature labour without having
any risk factors.

What are the symptoms?
Signs that you may be going into labour include:


bleeding from your vagina


cramping pains (contractions)


a new pain in your lower back, or


your waters breaking.


If you go into labour early, you and your baby will need treatment in hospital. Don't
delay asking for help.

If your doctor thinks you may go into labour early he or she will examine you and
possibly do some tests.

One is called a fetal fibronectin test. It involves having a swab of fluid taken from your vagina and tested for a certain
protein. This can show whether you are likely to go into labour soon.

Other tests that you might need include:


an ultrasound scan of your cervix to see if there are changes that suggest you are going into labour



tests to check for possible infection, and


tests to check on your baby's heartbeat.


If you are having contractions your doctor will also monitor how frequent they are.
What treatments work?
Treatments to prevent premature labour
Doctors usually can't predict whether a woman will have a premature labour, or stop
it happening. But they might offer treatments to help prevent an early labour in women
who are at high risk.

If a woman has a short cervix doctors might recommend having a stitch put into her cervix. You might hear your doctor call this cervical cerclage. This might help stop the cervix opening too early.

Having an infection caused by an overgrowth of bacteria in your vagina (called bacterial
vaginosis) can increase your chances of giving birth early. Antibiotics can help kill the bacteria. But it's not clear if having treatment with antibiotics
makes much difference in your chances of a premature labour.

Treatments to delay delivery
Once you go into labour there's little anyone can do to stop it. But if you go into
labour before 34 weeks your doctor might offer you medicines to try to delay your
delivery for a few days.

The medicines are called tocolytic agents. They can delay delivery by dampening down your contractions.

This allows more time for your baby to grow and develop in the womb. It also allows
you to be moved to a special hospital unit for the care of babies born early.

Treatments to help protect your baby
If your labour starts prematurely your doctor will probably recommend medicines called
corticosteroids (often just called steroids).

Corticosteroids speed up your baby's development, improving your baby's chances of
a healthy start. They work best if you have them at least 24 hours before your baby
is born. Corticosteroid injections seem to cause few, if any, side effects when used
in this way.

If your waters break before 37 weeks you might or might not go into labour soon after.
If you don't, you will be given antibiotics.

This is because you no longer have the protective sac of fluid around your baby (the
amniotic sac). As a result, you have a greater chance that an infection could get
into your womb and harm your baby. Antibiotics help prevent infection and might also
help to delay your labour.

What will happen to my baby?
Babies born at between 32 and 37 weeks are usually small and might need to stay in
hospital a little longer than babies born at full term. But in the long run they usually
do as well as babies born on or near their due date.

Babies born before 32 weeks might be very small and not properly developed. They might
need special care, usually in an incubator. Some need a life-support machine to help
them breathe.

There are some serious health problems that can affect babies born very early, and
babies born before 23 weeks usually do not survive. But medical care for premature
babies is better than it has ever been."

Pre-eclampsia is an illness that women can get when they're pregnant. It includes
having high blood pressure in the later stages of pregnancy, from about 20 weeks.

For many women, it's so mild that they don't even know they have it. But pre-eclampsia
always needs to be taken seriously. It can make you and your baby very ill. To read
more about what happens in pre-eclampsia and its symptoms, see the leaflet Pre-eclampsia: what is it?

Here, we look at ways to prevent and treat pre-eclampsia.
If you have the condition, your doctor may suggest drugs to lower your blood pressure.
You may need to go to hospital to rest until your baby is born. You may even need
to have your baby early. Pre-eclampsia doesn't get better until after your baby is
born.

Treatments to help prevent pre-eclampsia
If your doctor thinks that you have an increased chance of pre-eclampsia, a specialist
might recommend treatments.

You should always talk to your doctor before taking medicine when you're pregnant.
Your doctor can tell you whether it's safe for you and your baby.

If you have a higher-than-usual chance of getting pre-eclampsia, taking a low dose
of aspirin every day might help prevent it. If you can't take aspirin, there are similar drugs
that your doctor can prescribe instead.

Calcium supplements can also reduce your chance of pre-eclampsia. They're helpful if you
don't get much calcium in the foods you eat.

Treatments for high blood pressure
If you have high blood pressure while you're pregnant, you may be given treatment
to lower it. Drugs that lower your blood pressure include some beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and drugs to relax your blood vessels. They can all lower your blood pressure, but we do not know if they can stop pre-eclampsia
getting worse.

Drugs to lower your blood pressure can have side effects. Most of them can cause headaches
and an upset stomach. Taking some beta-blockers may mean your baby doesn't grow quite
as quickly. Your doctor will explain the side effects of the drug you're taking.

Doctors usually suggest you get plenty of rest if you're pregnant and have high blood
pressure. You'll also need regular check-ups. You may be asked to rest in bed at home,
go to a hospital or clinic during the day, or stay in hospital until you have your
baby.

Treatments for severe pre-eclampsia
If you have severe pre-eclampsia, you'll need to be looked after in hospital. You
may need to have your baby early. If it's too early for your baby to be born, you'll
have treatment to keep you and your baby healthy until you're ready.

The treatment you have in hospital will focus on:


monitoring you and your baby closely


controlling your blood pressure


deciding whether your baby needs to be born early, and how and when this should happen,
and



controlling seizures that can sometimes happen to women with pre-eclampsia.


You'll be given drugs to lower your blood pressure. If your blood pressure is very high, you'll probably have them as injections.

Severe pre-eclampsia can lead to seizures. Having a seizure can be dangerous for you
and your baby. So you may be given a drug called magnesium sulfate to prevent seizures. It's given as injections or a drip.

If you and your doctors decide you need to have your baby early, there are two choices.
You may be given drugs to make you go into labour. This is called inducing labour.

Or you can have an operation. A surgeon makes a cut in your tummy so your baby can
be born. This is called a caesarean section. You're more likely to have a caesarean if you're less than 32 weeks pregnant. That's
because it is harder to start up labour at that time.

If you need to have your baby early, you may be given an injection of steroids before
he or she is born. These help your baby’s lungs to get ready for birth, and make it
less likely he or she will be born with health problems."

Pre-eclampsia is an illness that women can get when they're pregnant. It includes
having high blood pressure in the later stages of pregnancy, from about 20 weeks.
For many women, it's so mild that they don't even know they have it. But pre-eclampsia
always needs to be taken seriously. It can make you and your baby very ill.

What is it?
When you're pregnant, a mass of tissue called the placenta grows between you and your
baby. It's there to feed the baby.

Doctors think pre-eclampsia starts when the placenta doesn't grow as it should. When
this happens your baby might not get enough food from the placenta. And the placenta
can send harmful chemicals into your bloodstream which raise your blood pressure.

Pre-eclampsia can start at any time from about the 20th week of pregnancy.
If you have mild pre-eclampsia, you might just need some extra check-ups. But if it's
more serious, you may need to stay in hospital until your baby is born. You may even
need to have your baby early.

Doctors don't really know what causes pre-eclampsia. But you have more chance of getting
it if you:



are over 40


are overweight or obese


have diabetes


have had pre-eclampsia before, or


are carrying more than one baby.


What are the symptoms?
Pre-eclampsia doesn't usually cause symptoms unless it gets serious. Any early signs
can be picked up during your regular check-ups. Signs include:



high blood pressure


more protein in your urine than normal, and


swelling in your hands, face, or feet.


Although high blood pressure and swelling are signs of pre-eclampsia, they do not
always mean that you have pre-eclampsia. For example, many women have some mild swelling
during pregnancy, especially in the ankles, feet, and hands.

If you have pre-eclampsia your baby might not be growing fast enough. Doctors can
see this on an ultrasound scan.

If pre-eclampsia gets bad, it can cause serious health problems. Signs include:


being sick (vomiting)


a bad headache


blurred or double vision, or flashing lights before your eyes, and


a bad pain just under your ribs.


If you get any of these, or if you're worried for any reason, see your doctor or midwife
straight away.

What will happen to me?
If you have pre-eclampsia, your doctor may suggest medications to lower your blood
pressure. You may need to go to hospital to rest until your baby is born. Pre-eclampsia
doesn't get better until after your baby is born.

To read more about treatments for pre-eclampsia, see the leaflet Pre-eclampsia: what treatments work?
If you get pre-eclampsia near the end of your pregnancy, you may be able to give birth
naturally. Otherwise, you'll probably need to have your baby early.

If you get severe pre-eclampsia at 34 weeks or later your baby will probably be delivered
as soon as your doctor thinks is safe. If you get bad pre-eclampsia earlier than this
you may be looked after in hospital for a while. This is to give your baby more time
to grow.

Some women get serious health problems because of pre-eclampsia. These include seizures,
or problems with their liver, kidneys, heart, or lungs.

But these problems are rare these days. The care women get during pregnancy helps
to pick up pre-eclampsia before it gets dangerous. Doctors can usually pick up problems
before they harm your baby.

Most women who've had pre-eclampsia get back to normal health after they have their
baby. You may need to recover in hospital for a few days.

The care your baby will need depends on lots of things, such as how early he or she
was born, and how small he or she is. Being born very early usually means babies need
more medical care.

Having pre-eclampsia once increases your chance of having it in your next pregnancy.
But most women who've had pre-eclampsia don't get it again.

In your next pregnancy you should be cared for by a specialist doctor. You will need
to have more frequent check-ups than usual."

If you have pre-diabetes it means that your blood sugar level is too high, but not
high enough to be classed as diabetes.

Pre-diabetes can easily develop into type 2 diabetes. But if you make changes to your
lifestyle it can usually be avoided.

What is pre-diabetes?
Pre-diabetes is a useful term for doctors when talking with people who are at risk
of getting type 2 diabetes.

Type 2 diabetes is a serious long-term condition. People with type 2 diabetes have
very high levels of glucose (sugar) in their blood. This can cause:



damage to the small blood vessels in the eyes, kidneys, and feet. This can lead to
sight problems, kidney disease, and foot amputations



damage to large blood vessels. This can lead to problems such as heart attacks and
strokes. Having type 2 diabetes greatly increases your chances of dying from heart
disease.



If you have pre-diabetes your blood sugar level is higher than it should be, but it’s
not high enough to be classed as diabetes.

While this is good news in one way, it’s also a warning: you could be on the way to
having diabetes, and it’s a good idea to act now to prevent it.

And it can be done. Research suggests that type 2 diabetes can be prevented in more
than 80 in 100 people.

Blood sugar is not the only way of predicting someone’s chance of getting type 2 diabetes.
Other things that make diabetes more likely include:



being very overweight (obese)


eating a diet that’s high in starchy or sugary foods and low in fresh fruits and vegetables


being older


having close family members with diabetes, and


being inactive.


What are the symptoms?
Pre-diabetes doesn’t usually have any symptoms. But, rarely, raised blood sugar can
cause patches of darkened skin in the armpits and neck, and around joints, such as
the knees, knuckles, and elbows.

What treatments work?
If you have raised blood sugar, the main things that can help you avoid diabetes are:


changing your lifestyle, and


taking prescription medicines that lower your blood sugar.


Changing your lifestyle
If we’re honest, most of us know that we aren’t always active enough and don’t eat
as healthily as we should. For many people, this doesn’t cause obvious problems.

But if you have blood sugar at pre-diabetes levels, an unhealthy lifestyle could lead
to serious health problems.

The main lifestyle changes that can prevent diabetes are:


changing your diet


being more active, and


losing weight if you are overweight. The first two changes should help you achieve
this one.



Being overweight is a major cause of type 2 diabetes. The good news is that most people
don’t have to lose a lot of weight to reduce their chances of getting diabetes. Losing
between one twentieth and one tenth of your body weight can make a big difference.

To lose this amount of weight you will probably need to:


eat a bit less


make some changes to what you eat and drink, and


be more active.


It might help to make a plan. For example, you might want to talk to your doctor or
practice nurse about what you need to do, and how to stick to it.

But it can be hard. Most people struggle to make healthy choices all the time. The
important thing is to do your best.

If your blood sugar is too high, the changes you will probably need to make to your
diet include:



avoiding starchy foods, such as potatoes, white rice, white bread, and white pasta.
If you find it hard to cut back on these foods, try eating brown rice and wholemeal
bread and pasta instead



avoiding foods that contain refined sugar, such as sweets, biscuits, and cakes


avoiding sugary drinks. You might also need to cut down on alcoholic drinks


eating more fresh fruits and vegetables, and


avoiding processed foods.


Being active is important in preventing diabetes for two reasons:


it lowers your blood sugar, and


it helps you to lose weight.


Most people find that it’s easier to stay active when they do a type of exercise that
they enjoy. So if, for example, going to the gym isn’t for you, there are plenty of
other ways to exercise, including walking, cycling, swimming, jogging, and playing
sports.

If you haven’t been very active for a long time, or if you are older, it’s a good
idea to start slowly. It might help to talk to your doctor about what type of exercise
would suit you best.

But if you’re younger and don’t have any health problems that stop you from exercising,
you will need to gradually build up the amount you exercise to the point where it
will make a real difference. This might mean going for long walks or doing an activity
that works up a sweat, several times a week.

Medications
The medications that can help with pre-diabetes are some of the same ones that are
used to treat diabetes itself. They work by reducing the amount of sugar in your blood.

If you have raised blood sugar that could lead to diabetes, your doctor might suggest
that you take medication to help. But he or she is more likely to suggest that making
changes to your lifestyle is more important.

This is because research suggests that, while medications can help reduce blood sugar,
losing weight and other changes to your lifestyle are better protection against diabetes.

Monitoring your blood sugar
Your doctor will probably also suggest that you have your blood sugar checked regularly.
You might hear this called an HbA1c test.

You might be able to use a kit at home to check your blood sugar with a finger-prick
test. Your doctor can explain the options and how they work.

What will happen?
It’s not possible to say what will happen to you as an individual. But we know that,
in most people with raised blood sugar classed as pre-diabetes, type 2 diabetes itself
can be prevented.

Preventing diabetes means preventing the complications that can cause serious health
problems and death."

​Postural hypotension is the name for the sudden drop in blood pressure that happens
to some people when they stand up after lying down. It can make you feel light headed,
which can lead to falls and injuries.

This type of low blood pressure happens a lot as we get older. But there are things
you can do to help prevent it. You can use our information to talk with your doctor
about the best treatments for you.

What is postural hypotension?
Most people know that high blood pressure (called hypertension) can lead to serious medical problems, such as heart attacks and strokes. But low blood pressure (called hypotension) can also cause problems.

Postural hypotension (you may also hear it called orthostatic hypotension) is a sudden drop in blood pressure that happens when you stand up. It can cause
light-headedness and dizziness, which can lead to falls and injuries, especially in
older people.

What happens?
Whenever you stand up, your blood naturally flows downwards in your body, towards
your legs and feet and away from your heart and brain.

To stop this happening too much, your blood vessels instantly get a bit narrower (they
constrict) when you stand up. This stops your blood from pooling in your legs too quickly,
and helps keep it flowing steadily around your body.

But if your blood vessels don’t constrict properly your heart can struggle to pump
enough blood to your brain. This causes the symptoms, such as dizziness, that can
lead to falls.

Why does it happen?
The most common cause of postural hypotension is getting older. Our blood vessels,
and the nerves and muscles that control them, don’t work as well as we age. Postural
hypotension affects more than 20 in every 100 people over the age of 80.

Several other things can cause postural hypotension. They include:


Some medicines


Conditions that can affect the nerves in the hands and feet, such as diabetes


Deing dehydrated


Parkinson’s, and



A type of dementia called Lewy body dementia.



What are the symptoms?
The symptoms of postural hypotension happen when you stand up from a lying-down position,
and they should get better when you sit or lie down again. They include:



Feeling light headed


Dizziness


Weakness


Feeling faint


Feeling tired when you exert yourself, and


Changes in your vision: for example, you may have dimmed vision, tunnel vision, or
be unable to see anything for a short time.



Many people’s symptoms are worse at certain times or places, such as:


Early in the morning, when people tend to be a little dehydrated


In hot weather or in hot buildings


After meals


After standing still for a while, and


During or after exercise, when blood vessels widen.


If you see your doctor with symptoms that suggest postural hypotension, they will
test your blood pressure when you are sitting and standing, to measure the difference.

They may also ask you to take your own blood pressure at home for a day or so. They
will show you how to do this and how to record the measurements.

What treatments are available?
Treatments for postural hypotension aim to:


Prevent or relieve your symptoms


Improve your quality of life, and


Prevent falls and injuries.


The first things your doctor may suggest are some changes to your lifestyle and routines
that may help with your symptoms. For example, they may suggest that you:



Take care, when you stand up after lying down, go into a sitting position for a few
moments first



Try not to strain too much when sitting on the toilet. If you have problems with constipation,
there are medicines that can help



Eat small, frequent meals. This helps prevent your blood pressure from falling too
much after eating



Take care when blowing hard through your mouth - for example, if you blow up a balloon
or play a woodwind or brass musical instrument



Use a bedside commode (pot) if you need to get up to urinate during the night


Do small, gentle exercises when standing, such as crossing your legs, standing on
your tiptoes, and tensing your leg muscles. These all help to push blood back to your
heart, and to keep it fit



Stay well hydrated - drink plenty of non-alcoholic fluids


Try to avoid lying down during the day. If you need to lie down, get up slowly afterwards,
and sit for a while before standing



Be aware of standing for a long time in hot environments, and


Use blocks to raise the head of your bed by 15 to 22cm (6 to 9 inches). This helps
your body to retain salt and water, which stops your blood pressure from falling too
much in the morning.



Your doctor may also advise you to add more salt to your diet, to help keep your blood pressure a little higher and to prevent dehydration. But you shouldn’t do this yourself without talking to your doctor first and having
your blood pressure taken properly.

Some people wear custom-made, full-length elastic stockings to help prevent too much blood from pooling in their legs, although some people find
these awkward to use. Your doctor can tell you more about these.

Medicines
Drug treatments for postural hypotension may mean taking medicines to stop your blood
pressure dropping too much. You usually take these at night.

But your doctor will want to get the right balance between not letting your blood
pressure get too low or too high. So, if you take these drugs your doctor will want
to check on you every few months.

Some medicines can actually cause low blood pressure. So your doctor may advise you
to try to reduce the dose of these, or stop taking them completely. You can talk with
your doctor about what may work best for you.

Medicines that can cause low blood pressure include:


Drugs used to relax muscles (including those that help men who have an enlarged prostate)



Diuretics, which stop the body from retaining too much water, and



Some drugs used to treat anxiety and depression.



If you decide to stop taking drugs that help with prostate problems, this can make
you more likely to get urinary tract or bladder infections. So your doctor should
talk to you about the symptoms to look out for, and what to do if it happens.

What to expect in the future
Postural hypertension is often the result of another condition, such as diabetes.
So the outlook largely depends on how that other condition is affecting you.

For example, if your diabetes treatment goes well, then your problems with blood pressure
should not get worse over time.

The things that cause postural hypotension can’t always be reversed or cured. But
many people find that making changes to their lifestyle or trying different treatments
can help them to manage their symptoms."

Postnatal depression is depression that can happen to a woman soon after she has had
a baby. If you have postnatal depression you may feel sad and anxious, and you may
find it hard to look after your baby. But there are treatments that can help you feel
better.

We've brought together the best and most up-to-date research about postnatal depression
to see what treatments work. You can use our information to talk to your doctor and
decide which treatments are best for you.

What is it?
It's very common to feel low, irritable, or anxious for a few days after your baby
is born. This is often called the 'baby blues'. But if these feelings don't go away,
or if they get worse, you may have postnatal depression.

Postnatal depression is an illness. It is not a sign that you don't love your baby.
There's no single reason why some women get postnatal depression. It may be caused
by a combination of things. Having a baby means you have a lot to cope with, including
changes to your body and your whole way of life, at a time when you are physically
exhausted.

Things that make you more likely to get postnatal depression include:


having had depression before


feeling that you don't get enough support from family and friends


having a difficult relationship with your partner


other difficulties in your life (for example, money problems).


If you have strange thoughts and feelings about your baby, or if you hear or see things
that aren't real, you may have a different and more serious illness called puerperal
psychosis (the word 'puerperal' refers to childbirth and the time just after childbirth).
You are likely to need to be looked after in hospital. Where possible, your baby will
be able to stay with you.

Doctors think puerperal psychosis is caused by a reaction to the changing levels of
hormones in your body. This means that it is only temporary. But getting treatment
means you will be back to normal much sooner.

What are the symptoms?
Postnatal depression is no different from depression that can happen to anyone at
any time. But having a new baby to care for can make depression harder to cope with.


Postnatal depression is most common in the first three months after your baby is born.


Symptoms of depression include:


feeling low and anxious


losing interest in life


having trouble sleeping


having less energy


feeling guilty


thinking about death.


When you are also trying to care for a baby, at a time when people expect you to be
happy, you may have other symptoms as well. These can include:



feeling overwhelmed by your baby's needs


feeling trapped, angry, fearful, and panicky


feeling alone and unable to talk about how you feel.


Some women may also fear that they might harm their baby.
Some of these symptoms are a normal part of being a new mother: for example, feeling
exhausted because your baby is keeping you awake or needs a lot of looking after.
So doctors don't always spot postnatal depression for what it is.

But it is important to see your doctor early on if you think you may be depressed.
The sooner you get help, the sooner you are likely to feel better and start enjoying
being a mother. For example, you could discuss your feelings with your health visitor.


What treatments work?
Postnatal depression is temporary and it usually goes away on its own. But it can
last for a while. That can be harmful for you, your baby, and your partner if you
have one.

But there are treatments that can help you feel better sooner. The aims of treatment
are to help you:



feel as well as possible


look after yourself and your baby through a difficult time


bond with and enjoy your baby as much as possible.


Not all women with postnatal depression will have the same level of symptoms. Some
women may just feel the need to talk to someone and be reassured, while others will
need a lot of treatment and support, possibly urgently.

The important thing is that women get help and support as quickly as possible. This
is especially important for women who are having trouble caring for or bonding with
their baby.

Treatments for postnatal depression
For women whose depression is not severe - for example, those who can still look after
their baby and whose daily lives are not affected too much - doctors recommend ""talking
treatments"" such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal therapy.

CBT can involve a series of sessions with a therapist, or you might start off by seeing
a therapist and then follow up with computer-based sessions. Either way, the aim is
to make you feel better and more able to cope by challenging negative thoughts and
beliefs and focusing on positive ones.

For example, some women with postnatal depression develop the idea that they are 'bad'
mothers (a negative idea), whereas the truth is probably that they are doing a great
job in a tough situation (a positive idea).

Interpersonal therapy focuses on the idea that problems such as depression can be caused by difficulties
interacting with other people. These difficulties can affect your relationships and
make you unhappy.

The aim of this treatment is to help you interact better with other people, especially
the people closest to you. For example, the treatment may help you to express more
clearly what kind of support you need from the people close to you. Just like with
CBT, this treatment involves sessions with a therapist.

Many women find talking treatments helpful. But if they don't help, or if you don't
want to try them, your doctor might suggest antidepressants. These are medications that can lift your mood. Your doctor might also suggest antidepressants
if you have a history of severe depression.

Some women have antidepressants along with a talking treatment, especially if they
have severe depression.

If you are breastfeeding, your doctor will be cautious about prescribing antidepressants.
This is because these drugs might get into your breast milk, and not enough is known
about how this can affect your baby. Some drugs seem safer than others for babies
of breastfeeding mothers. Your doctor should explain the risks and possible side effects
to you.

Treatments for postnatal bipolar depression
Some women have bipolar depression soon after having a baby. People with bipolar depression
(which used to be called 'manic depression') have the same symptoms of low mood that
come with depression. But they also have periods of unusually high or 'hyper' mood.

Drug treatments can help people with bipolar depression stabilise their moods. But
the drugs for bipolar depression are different from those for ordinary depression
and are not thought to be safe for women who are breastfeeding.

If you have bipolar depression after having a baby and you are breastfeeding, your
doctor should refer you to a psychiatrist who is experienced in helping women with
postnatal bipolar depression.

What will happen to me?
If you have postnatal depression it's hard to say exactly when you will start to feel
better. It depends on how bad your depression is, and on whether and how soon you
get help.

Most women get back to normal by the time their baby is 6 months old. But some women
are still depressed by the time their baby is 1 year old.

Women who have postnatal depression with their first baby are more likely to have
it if they have another baby. But knowing that this could happen means that you and
those close to you can be more prepared next time.

Getting help with postnatal depression can help it pass sooner, which is better for
you and your baby. There are many ways that you can get help - it doesn't have to
mean taking antidepressants. The first step is just to speak up and ask for help.

Where to get more help
You don't have to go through postnatal depression feeling alone. There are many charities
and support groups that offer help to women with postnatal depression. Your doctor
should be able to suggest some. But they can also be found easily on the internet.

Many of these support groups offer helplines that you can call if you feel in need
of urgent support, so that you can talk to someone who understands what you are going
through."

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can affect people who've been involved in one
or more frightening or dangerous events. But it doesn't just affect people who are
directly involved. For example, you can also get PTSD if you've witnessed a traumatic
event, or you've been involved in another way, perhaps as a member of the emergency
services.

We've looked at the best and most up-to-date research to produce this information.
You can use it to talk to your doctor and decide which treatments are right for you.

What treatments work?
It's normal to feel frightened or anxious after something traumatic happens to you.
Although these feelings are upsetting, they usually go away after a few weeks. But
if these feelings last for longer than a month, and if they stop you getting on with
your life, then you may have PTSD.

Most people with PTSD have symptoms straight after they've been through a traumatic
event. But for some people the symptoms don't start until months or years later.

If a traumatic event happened fairly recently and your symptoms are not severe, your
doctor may recommend waiting for a few weeks before starting treatment, to see if
your symptoms improve (this is called watchful waiting).

But if your symptoms are severe or you've had symptoms for more than three months,
your doctor will recommend having treatment.

Talking treatments (psychotherapies) and medicines called antidepressants can both
help with PTSD. Doctors usually recommend having a talking treatment first, as studies
suggest these treatments are the most effective for PTSD. But you can talk to your
doctor about the kind of treatment you'd prefer.

Your therapist should encourage your family or carers to play a part in understanding
and supporting you through your treatment.

Talking treatments
A talking treatment called trauma-focused cognitive behaviour therapy can help people who have PTSD. This kind of therapy focuses on helping you understand
your thoughts and feelings related to the traumatic event, and finding practical ways
of coping with them.

Trauma-focused cognitive behaviour therapy can help you feel less anxious, have fewer
symptoms of PTSD, and even recover completely.

But it can be hard to talk about traumatic events. People sometimes drop out of therapy
because of this.

As an alternative, you can have cognitive behaviour therapy that doesn't focus directly on the trauma. Instead, it helps you more generally address
your feelings and thoughts and find practical ways to cope, including how to manage
stress.

Another helpful talking treatment for PTSD is called eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing.

With this treatment, your therapist asks you to remember something about the traumatic
event that you went through. While you're doing this, your therapist may make movements
in the air with his or her finger.

You follow the movements with your eyes. The idea is that remembering an event while
you're distracted helps you to reorganise your memories and make them less upsetting.

Instead of finger movements, your doctor might also use other distractions, such as
hand or toe tapping, or musical tones.

For each of these talking treatments, you will meet regularly with a therapist (at
least once a week). You will probably have at least eight to 12 sessions, with more
sessions if you need them.

Drug treatments
Antidepressants are sometimes used to treat PTSD if talking treatments don't help
(or don't help enough) or if a person would prefer not to have a talking treatment.
There are several types of antidepressants. You can talk with your doctor about which
one might suit you.

You might feel a little better within a week or two of starting an antidepressant.
But it often takes six to eight weeks to feel a lot better. So it's important not
to stop taking them early. Once an antidepressant is working, doctors usually recommend
taking it for at least 12 months.

Some people get side effects from antidepressants, such as dry mouth, dizziness, stomach
upsets, or problems sleeping. Your doctor will help you find the antidepressant that
works best for you, and which causes the least side effects.

Some antidepressants can occasionally cause more serious side effects. Your doctor
should discuss these with you and tell you what to look out for.

Some antidepressants can cause withdrawal symptoms if you stop taking them suddenly
or if your dose is reduced. Talk to your doctor first if you decide you want to stop
taking an antidepressant.

What is PTSD?
It's normal to feel frightened or anxious after something traumatic happens to you.
Although these feelings are upsetting, they usually go away after a few weeks.

However, if these feelings last for longer than a month, and stop you getting on with
your life, then you may have PTSD.

Most people with PTSD have symptoms straight after they've been through a traumatic
event. But for some people the symptoms don't start until months or years later.

People often think that you only get PTSD if you've survived something exceptionally
terrifying, like a rape or a war. But lots of other things can cause it too.

For example, you can get PTSD if someone close to you dies suddenly, or if you've
been involved in a traffic accident.

What are the symptoms?
If you have PTSD, you may:


have strong memories of a traumatic event


have flashbacks, where you feel as if you're living through the event again



have nightmares about the event



try not to talk or think about what happened


avoid people or places that remind them about it


feel alert, tense, or nervous


feel irritable and angry. This can put a strain on your relationships with family
and friends



feel very negative about yourself and about the world, and withdraw from other people.


You can also get physical symptoms if you have PTSD. These can include:



dizziness


nausea


headaches


feeling as though your heart is beating very fast or hard


difficulty concentrating, and


difficulty sleeping.


A lot of these feelings are normal after a frightening event. But if you have PTSD,
your symptoms don't fade with time. And they start to interfere with your life.

PTSD can be difficult for doctors to spot. You may not like talking about the traumatic
event you went through. But it's important to tell your doctor about it.

Doctors may mistake PTSD for other illnesses, such as depression, if they don't know
about the traumatic experience that the person went through. And some people have
depression as well as PTSD.

It's also not uncommon to have other illnesses, too, such as anxiety disorder, and
problems with drugs or alcohol. These conditions need to be treated as well as the
PTSD.

What will happen to me?
One of the hardest parts of having PTSD can be asking for help. But it's very important.
Getting treatment can help you feel better and get on with your life. And it's never
too late to start treatment.

With treatment, many people recover. But sometimes PTSD can be a lifelong condition.
You may find that your symptoms come and go. You may feel better at times, and then
feel worse if you come across something that reminds you of what you've been through.
If this is the case, having treatment can help you cope.

Where can I get help?
Your doctor is the best person to talk to first. He or she may refer you to a specialist
in PTSD, such as a psychologist.

PTSD can make it harder to cope with life in general. You may feel you need some practical
support, or someone to talk to. Friends and family members may be able to help. And
your doctor will be able to tell you about support services and support groups in
your area.

Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR for short) mainly affects the muscles in the neck, shoulders,
and hips. The main symptoms are pain and stiffness in these areas first thing in the
morning.

There are medicines that can relieve the symptoms and often clear them up completely.
But this can take time and you might need treatment more than once.

You can use our information to talk to your doctor about the best treatments for you.
What is polymyalgia rheumatica?
Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is a condition that causes inflammation (swelling) in the muscles around the shoulders, neck, and hips.

This swelling causes pain and extreme stiffness, mainly first thing in the morning. This stiffness usually lasts for at least 45
minutes. Many people find it hard to move much, if at all, until the stiffness passes.

PMR is not especially common: it affects about 6 in every 10,000 people over the age
of 50. It hardly ever affects people younger than this.

It’s not clear what causes PMR. It has been suggested that it could be linked to an
infection, or that it could be genetic. But no one really knows.

What we do know is that you are more likely to have PMR if you are:


over 50 years old. Most people diagnosed with PMR are actually over 70


of white, northern European ancestry


a woman - about two-thirds of people diagnosed with PMR are women.


What are the symptoms?

The main symptoms of PMR are pain and stiffness that mainly affects the neck, shoulders, and hips. This is at its worst first thing in the morning, but it usually improves as the
day goes on.

Some people find that their symptoms are so bad in the morning that getting out of
bed is difficult, or that they might have to wait a while before they can get up.

Other symptoms
PMR can cause other problems in some people. These can include:


a mild fever (called a low-grade fever)


weight loss and loss of appetite


feeling physically weak and generally unwell


night sweats


pain in the wrists and hands, and


swelling of the hands and feet.


Some people with PMR develop depression because of their symptoms. If this happens to you, talk to your doctor.

Depression is not uncommon with conditions that cause pain and discomfort. Your doctor
will know this, and should be able to prescribe treatments that help.

Diagnosing PMR
The main ways that doctors diagnose PMR are to examine you and to ask you about your
symptoms.

The symptoms of PMR are often similar to those of conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis
and bursitis (a type of shoulder injury). So it can take time to diagnose PMR accurately.
Your doctor may ask you quite a lot of detailed questions.

For example, they will probably ask you things like:


where exactly your pain and stiffness happen


when these symptoms happen and how long they last, and


whether your symptoms improve as the day goes on, and how much they improve.


Your doctor might also ask you to move your arms, shoulders, and legs, to see if and
how your movement is affected by your symptoms.



people are more likely to have PMR if they also have a condition called giant cell arteritis, which causes swelling of the lining of the arteries. So your doctor should check
for signs of this condition



your doctor might suggest that you try a short course of corticosteroid tablets. If your symptoms improve within a few days, this suggests that they are caused by
PMR and not by something else.



Tests such as scans and blood tests can also be useful, mainly in finding or ruling out other causes of pain and stiffness.

What treatments are available?
The main treatment for PMR is corticosteroid tablets. These drugs are powerful anti-inflammatories. This means that they reduce inflammation
(swelling) that can cause pain and stiffness.

Corticosteroids can make a big difference to many people’s symptoms. But they can
also cause harmful side effects.

Most of these side effects only happen when someone has been taking corticosteroids
for more than a short time. But some of them can be serious. So your doctor will want
to give you the lowest dose that helps you, for the shortest possible time.

Side effects of corticosteroids can include:


mood changes and other mental-health symptoms. Unlike some side effects, this can
happen in the short term. So it’s good to be aware that this can happen



developing type 2 diabetes


increased appetite, which can lead to weight gain


feeling tired


being more likely to get infections


indigestion or bleeding from the stomach,


raised blood pressure, and


weakened bones. If you are going to take corticosteroids for more than a short time
your doctor should prescribe a vitamin D supplement to help keep your bones strong. It’s important to get enough calcium too. Your doctor
might recommend an extra medicine, called a bisphosphonate, to protect your bones.



If your symptoms improve or clear up with corticosteroids, your doctor will probably
suggest that you either take a lower dose, or stop taking them completely, at least
for a while. This helps to prevent side effects.

If you find that your symptoms start to return, your doctor will probably suggest
that you take corticosteroids again, at the lowest and safest possible dose, until
your symptoms improve or go.

Most people need several courses of treatment, sometimes over two or three years,
to get rid of their symptoms completely.

Some people have withdrawal symptoms when they stop taking corticosteroids.

Some of these withdrawal symptoms, such as aches and tiredness, are quite similar
to the symptoms of PMR. So it can be quite hard to know what’s causing them.

Because of this, and the need to prevent side effects, your doctor will want to keep
an eye on you, both while you are taking steroids, and when you stop.

Other medicines
Some people find that corticosteroids don’t help them enough, or that their symptoms
clear up but then come back just as bad as before.

If this happens to you, your doctor might suggest medicines that are usually used
to treat other conditions that cause inflammation, such as rheumatoid arthritis.

These medicines help to stop your immune system from attacking your tissues and joints. This can help to reduce the inflammation
that causes PMR.

Like corticosteroids, these medicines cause side effects in some people. So your doctor
should discuss these with you, and follow up with you regularly if you need to take
them.

NSAIDs
You’ve probably heard of anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen. The medical name
of this type of medicine is non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

Most of the time NSAIDs are not recommended for treating PMR.

Your doctor may suggest them for a short time if you are stopping corticosteroids.
But they can cause side effects if taken for too long, including bleeding in the stomach.

If your doctor thinks that you need to take them for longer, they might prescribe
something to help protect your stomach.

What to expect in the future
With treatment, the outlook for most people with PMR is good. Symptoms usually clear
up completely or improve greatly.But recovery doesn’t usually happen quickly. Most
people need to take several courses of treatment - usually corticosteroids - over
two to three years.And some people need treatment for longer, and with different drugs.Most
doctors recommend regular follow-up for people being treated for PMR, usually every
one to thtee months. This helps your doctor to:



check how you are improving


keep an eye on side effects, and


increase or reduce your medicine dose as needed.


You should also tell your doctor right away if your symptoms change suddenly or if
you get new symptoms."

Polycystic ovary syndrome is a common hormone problem that affects women. It can make
your menstrual periods less regular, and you may have trouble getting pregnant. But
there are good treatments and things you can do yourself that may help.

What treatments work?
If you are diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) it means that your hormones
are not in balance. The hormones made by your ovaries are the ones most affected.
They are called oestrogens, androgens, and progesterone.

These hormones affect a lot of things that go on in your body, including when you
have your period, when your ovaries release eggs, how hair grows on your face and
body, and the condition of your skin.

Treatment for PCOS depends on what symptoms you get, and whether or not you want to
get pregnant.

If you are having trouble getting pregnant, there are fertility treatments that may
help. Ask for our leaflet, Fertility problems: what treatments work? for more information about this.

Losing weight
If you are overweight, one of the first things that your doctor will suggest is losing
weight. Losing some weight, even if it's not much, may help your body to ovulate normally.
This may help with getting pregnant. However, it may not make much difference for
unwanted hair or acne.

Losing weight will work only if you are overweight. Don't try to lose weight if you're
already at a healthy weight. If you're not sure, ask your doctor.

No one diet has been shown to be better than another for helping women with PCOS lose
weight. The key is to find a diet you can stick to.

Hair removal
If your main problem is unwanted hair on your face and body, you've probably tried
different methods of hair removal.

Shaving or using depilatory creams removes hair above the root, but it grows back
after a day or two. Waxing pulls hair out by the roots, so it lasts a little longer.
These treatments can be done at home or in a beauty clinic.

Electrolysis aims to damage the root of the hair, so it doesn't grow back at all.
Laser treatments slow down the growth of hair. After about four treatments, the hair
may stop coming back. But both treatments can be expensive and time-consuming, and
some women find them painful.

Lots of private clinics offer laser hair removal. If you decide to have this treatment,
make sure the clinic you choose is properly registered.

A cream called eflornithine slows down hair growth on the face. You have to get it
from a doctor. If other treatments have not helped, you could ask your doctor about
it.

Medicines (if you want to get pregnant)
If you want to get pregnant, a medicine called metformin may help control your periods
and reduce unwanted hair.

Metformin is also used to treat people with diabetes. It helps control the levels
of sugar in your blood. But it also seems to help some women with PCOS. You're likely
to have more regular periods if you take metformin. This might make it easier for
you to get pregnant.

Some women who take metformin have side effects. But these are mostly mild. You might
feel some nausea or heartburn, or get diarrhoea.

Other treatments can help stimulate your ovaries, so they are more likely to release
eggs. We have more information about these in our fertility treatment leaflet. Some
examples are clomifene and gonadotrophins.

Medicines (if you don't want to get pregnant)
If you don't want to get pregnant and you are having problems with irregular periods,
unwanted hair, or spots, your doctor may suggest you take the contraceptive pill.
This is the first medicine you are likely to be offered.

The pill may make you put on weight. All women taking the combined oestrogen and progestogen
pill have a slightly higher risk of breast cancer and of getting a blood clot in their
veins (deep vein thrombosis).

If you've tried taking the pill and it hasn't helped, or if you have a lot of unwanted
hair, your doctor may suggest anti-androgen drugs. These reduce the amount of androgen
hormones in your body and may help reduce unwanted hair. They should only be prescribed
by a specialist.

You have to be careful not to get pregnant while taking these drugs, as they can harm
your unborn baby. You'll need to take these drugs for a long time (six months to 18
months) to see the full effect. If you stop taking them, the hair will start growing
back again.

Anti-androgen drugs have side effects which can be serious. You should discuss them
with your doctor before you start taking them.

Your doctor may also suggest metformin, sometimes along with either the pill or an
anti-androgen drug.

These hormones affect a lot of things that go on in your body, including when you

Women with PCOS often have small, fluid-filled swellings (cysts) on their ovaries.
That's how polycystic ovary syndrome gets its name. Polycystic means with lots of
cysts.

Doctors don't know why women get PCOS, but it seems to run in families.
What are the symptoms?
The most common symptom of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is having irregular periods,
or not having periods at all. This can make it harder to get pregnant because you
are not releasing eggs (ovulating) regularly.

Women with PCOS often have unwanted hair on the body and face, and oily skin with
spots (acne). About half of women with PCOS are very overweight (obese).

You may not get all these symptoms. Many women with PCOS have only one or two.
If you find your symptoms upsetting, talk to your doctor. He or she may not realise
how much they upset you.

You will probably need blood tests to check your hormone levels, and to rule out other
causes for your symptoms. Your doctor might ask you to have an ultrasound scan to
check for cysts on your ovaries.

What will happen to me?
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects women in different ways, so it's hard to
tell what will happen to you.

Symptoms can be affected by anything that affects your hormones, like getting pregnant,
putting on or losing weight, or going through the menopause.

Many women with PCOS have trouble getting pregnant. But that doesn't mean you won't
be able to have children. Many women go on to have children, with or without treatment.


In the long term, you may be more likely to get diabetes. This is more likely if you
are overweight. You can talk to your doctor about having regular diabetes tests.

Where to get more help
There are support groups and charities that provide help for women with PCOS. For
example, in the UK, a charity called Verity (verity-pcos.org.uk) offers support and

A pneumothorax happens when air gets into the space between your chest wall and one
of your lungs. This can cause part or all of one lung to collapse. The condition can
be dangerous but is usually treatable if you don’t delay in getting help.
What is a pneumothorax?
The area between your lungs and your chest wall is called the pleural space.

If air gets into this space it can put pressure on one of your lungs, causing part
or all of it to collapse (you sometimes hear of pneumothorax being called a collapsed lung). If this happens you can struggle to breathe properly and to get enough oxygen.

The danger of a pneumothorax depends on how much air gets into the pleural space.
A small pneumothorax can sometimes heal by itself but most need treatment. Although
it is a medical emergency, death from pneumothorax is rare.

Different types of pneumothorax
Pneumothorax can happen for several reasons, including what is called ‘spontaneous’ pneumothorax. This means that it happens without an obvious cause, in someone who has no history
of lung problems.

Although we don’t know for sure what causes spontaneous pneumothorax, it is much more
common in people who smoke.

Smoking seems to weaken the walls of the lungs. This allows air from the lungs to
escape into the pleural space and cause a pneumothorax.

Pneumothorax seems to be more common in men and boys who are tall and slim.
What’s called a secondary spontaneous pneumothorax is slightly different. This happens suddenly in someone who has an existing lung
disease, which weakens the wall of the lung, making it more likely to tear and leak
air into the pleural space.

A tension pneumothorax is a rare type of pneumothorax. It means that the amount of air in the pleural space
increases every time you take a breath, as if the hole in the lung is working like
a one-way valve. This type of pneumothorax needs the most urgent treatment.

A common cause of pneumothorax is lung disease, especially chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD is a condition where the lungs become damaged, causing breathing problems.
It is almost always caused by smoking.

Other causes of pneumothorax include:


other conditions that affect the lungs, including pneumonia, tuberculosis, and cystic
fibrosis



a chest injury, such as a cracked rib that pierces a lung


your genes. Some lung problems, including pneumothorax, seem to run in families.


What are the symptoms?
The main symptoms of pneumothorax are:


chest pain, and


shortness of breath.


If you have these symptoms together, seek urgent medical help. And always get medical
help if you have severe chest pain.

Your doctor may not be able to diagnose a pneumothorax just by looking at you. So
it’s likely you’ll have a chest x-ray. You may also need other tests or scans, such
as a CT (computerised tomography) scan.

What treatments work?
The aims of treatment are to:


remove the air from the pleural space, and


prevent the problem happening again.


For most types of pneumothorax you will need to stay in hospital for at least a day
or two, and sometimes a week or more.

A very small pneumothorax can often heal on its own. And if you are young and don’t
have any other health problems you may be able to go home after a few hours.

But if your pneumothorax is larger, or if you are older or have other health problems,
your doctor will want to monitor you in hospital. And you will be given oxygen to
breathe through a mask to help with shortness of breath.

For a larger pneumothorax you will probably need one or more of the following treatments.


Letting out the air through a needle
The technical name for this treatment is needle aspiration. It means that a small needle is inserted into the chest wall to let out the build-up
of air - a bit like making a small hole in a bicycle tyre.

The needle can be connected to a syringe so that the doctor can draw out the air more
easily.

Letting out the air with a chest tube
For a larger pneumothorax, or where your doctor thinks a needle is not going to work
well enough, you may need to have a chest tube inserted through a small cut in your
chest wall.

This procedure is called a thoracostomy. It works in a similar way to needle aspiration to let out the build-up of air.

If you have this treatment your doctor may insert a tiny camera through the cut in
the chest wall to get a closer look at the problem. This procedure is called a thoracoscopy.

Securing the lung to the chest wall
If your doctor thinks there is a strong chance that you will have another pneumothorax
(for example, if your lungs have been weakened by lung disease), or if this is not
your first pneumothorax, he or she may suggest a procedure to attach the lung to the
chest wall.

This is called pleurodesis. It involves injecting a drug into the pleural space that causes the lung and chest
wall to stick to each other, almost as if they had been glued together.

If your doctor thinks this treatment might help you, he or she should discuss it in
detail with you, including:



how likely it is to work


the possible benefits


any possible risks, and


the likelihood of having another pneumothorax if you choose not to have the procedure.


Your doctor can advise you, but the final choice about whether to have the procedure
is yours.

What to expect in the future
Up to half of people who have a first spontaneous pneumothorax will have another pneumothorax
at some point.

And people who have a secondary spontaneous pneumothorax have a greater chance of
the problem happening again. So it’s important to be aware of the symptoms and get
medical help if they happen again.

Having pleurodesis can help prevent another pneumothorax. But it doesn’t always solve
the problem permanently.

Having another pneumothorax is more likely if you smoke.
Changes in environmental pressure can also cause another pneumothorax. This can happen
either with:



reduced air pressure at high altitude, or


increased water pressure caused by underwater diving.


If you do any diving your doctor will probably advise you to stop unless you have
had successful pleurodesis. And he or she will advise you to avoid air travel for
a while after you have treatment for a pneumothorax."

Pneumonia is caused by an infection in your lungs. It can be very serious, especially
if you're older or in poor health. So, for some groups of people, doctors recommend
vaccines that help prevent it.
What vaccines work?
There are two vaccines that can help protect you against pneumonia. One is called
the pneumococcal vaccine. The other is the flu vaccine.

It might sound strange to have a flu vaccine to prevent pneumonia. But having flu
weakens your body. This makes you more likely to get other illnesses, including pneumonia.

Pneumococcal vaccine
The pneumococcal vaccine helps to protect against invasive pneumonia, a serious complication where the infection spreads from your lungs to other parts
of your body.

The pneumococcal vaccine is designed to protect against the most common type of pneumonia.
The vaccine contains bacteria, but these bacteria are dead and can't harm you. The
pneumococcal vaccine can't give you pneumonia or any other illness.

The vaccine can cause side effects in some people, such as:


a sore arm where you had the injection


a fever, and


pain in some joints and muscles.


These side effects don't usually last more than a few days.
Most people need the pneumococcal vaccine only once. You don't need a new one every
year. But some people with a weak immune system or problems with their spleen need
another vaccination after five years. Ask your doctor if you think this might apply
to you.

The flu vaccine
Having flu makes you more likely to get pneumonia. So, if you have the flu vaccine,
it may also reduce your chance of getting pneumonia. For example, research suggests
that older people who live in nursing homes are less likely to get pneumonia if they
have a flu jab.

You need to get a new injection every year, usually in October or November.
The flu vaccine can't give you flu. But it can cause similar side effects to those that some
people get after the pneumonia jab.

Do I need a flu vaccine or pneumococcal vaccine?
Different countries have different recommendations about who should have these vaccines.
For example, in the UK, the pneumococcal vaccine is recommended if you:


are 65 or older


have a long-term illness, such as diabetes, heart disease, kidney disease, liver disease,
sickle cell disease, or a problem with your spleen



have a lung condition, such as emphysema or severe asthma


might be likely to get pneumonia where you work: for example, if you are a healthcare worker


have a weak immune system (for example, if you're getting chemotherapy or steroid
treatment, or you have HIV or AIDS)



have a cochlear implant (a device put inside your ear to help with hearing loss)


have had cerebrospinal fluid leaking, possibly due to an accident or surgery (this
fluid surrounds the brain and spine).



There is a different type of pneumococcal vaccine that's recommended for babies. It's
usually given in three doses: one at 2 months of age, one at 4 months, and one at
12 to 13 months.

A flu vaccine is recommended each year if:


You are 65 or older


You are pregnant


You live in a nursing home


You have a long-term illness, such as diabetes, heart disease, kidney disease, liver
disease, sickle cell disease, Parkinson's disease, or a problem with your spleen



You have a lung condition, such as emphysema or severe asthma


You have a weak immune system (for example, if you're getting chemotherapy or steroid
treatment, or you have HIV or AIDS)



You live with or care for someone who could get very ill if they had flu (for example,
you work in a nursing home).



It's also important that children over the age of 6 months receive an annual flu vaccination
if they have a long-term health condition that could get worse if they catch the flu.

Many countries now offer flu vaccines to children. For example, in the UK, the flu
vaccine is offered to children aged between 2 and 16 years old. This vaccine is usually
given as a nasal spray, not an injection."

Pneumonia is caused by an infection in your lungs. It can be serious, so it's important
to get treatment quickly.
We've brought together the best and most up-to-date research about pneumonia to see
what treatments work. You can use our information to talk to your doctor and decide
which treatments are best for you.

What is pneumonia?
Pneumonia is usually caused by an infection with bacteria or a virus. The infection
causes inflammation (swelling) in your lungs. Parts of your lungs can then clog up
with fluid, making it harder for you to breathe.

What are the symptoms?
Pneumonia is serious and can make you feel very ill.


Many people have a fever and a cough.


You may feel as if you can't catch your breath.


You'll be weak and tired and just generally feel ill. Older people with pneumonia
sometimes feel confused.



You probably won't feel like eating or drinking.


Some people get chest pain as they breathe in or out. This can happen if you get inflammation
between the layers of tissue that cover your lungs. This stops your lungs moving smoothly
as you breathe. It's called pleurisy.

Having pneumonia can sometimes make it hard to breathe in enough oxygen. This is very
dangerous. If you get a bluish tinge to your lips or the skin under your fingernails,
call an ambulance right away.

You should also get emergency help if you feel confused, or if another person notices
that you are confused, they might call for help. Confusion is another sign that you're
not getting enough oxygen.

Your doctor might suggest a chest x-ray to help find out what's causing your symptoms.
What treatments work?
If you have pneumonia that's caused by bacteria you'll need treatment with antibiotics
as soon as possible. Antibiotics are drugs that kill bacteria. Bacteria are the most
common cause of pneumonia.

You'll probably take your antibiotics at home as tablets. But if for some reason you
can't take tablets, or if your symptoms are severe, you'll be given antibiotics as
a drip.

If you don't start to feel better within three days of starting treatment, tell your
doctor (he or she should have arranged a follow-up with you to check if you're improving).
You may need to try a different type of antibiotic.

It's very important that you finish taking your tablets. You need to do this even
if you start feeling better. If you don't finish your treatment, some bacteria may
not be killed. They can start to grow in your lungs again and your pneumonia could
come back and be more difficult to treat.

Antibiotics can have side effects. The most common are nausea (feeling sick), vomiting,
or diarrhoea. Some people get a rash. This happens because of a mild allergic reaction.
It's not serious, but you should let your doctor know about it.

It's also possible to have a more serious allergic reaction. Tell your doctor if you're
allergic to any antibiotics: for example, some people are allergic to penicillin.

Antibiotics will not work if your pneumonia is caused by a virus. But you may need
them if you get a bacterial infection in addition to an infection caused by a virus.
Viral pneumonia usually clears up by itself.

Getting out of bed and moving around a little each day can help you get better. This
is because it exercises your lungs. But don't do too much.

Will I need to go to hospital?
Most people with pneumonia recover at home. But some people need to be treated in
hospital. For example, your doctor may think you need hospital treatment if you're
older or if you have other medical conditions or a more serious case of pneumonia.

In hospital, as well as antibiotics, you'll probably be given fluids through a drip
in your arm. This will stop you getting dehydrated if you are too ill to drink. You'll
also have your temperature and breathing checked regularly.

You might also be given a short course of steroids (their full name is corticosteroids).
These are drugs that help reduce the swelling in your lungs.

If you're treated in hospital, getting out of bed and moving around for a few minutes
a day may help you go home sooner. You may also be able to go home sooner if you exercise
your lungs. You can do this by breathing deeply or blowing through a tube into a bottle
of water.

Ask your doctor about how much you should be moving around, and whether breathing
exercises could help you.

Taking care of yourself
Pneumonia needs to be taken seriously even if you are young and fit. You need to take
good care of yourself. There are some simple things you can do to help your recovery.



Get plenty of rest. You can start to do more as you feel better, but don't push yourself.
Don't do anything that you don't feel well enough to do. If you're resting in bed,
turn over at least every hour while you're awake. Breathe deeply five to 10 times
and then cough strongly a couple of times. This helps to clear any phlegm that's settled
in your lungs.



If you have a fever or are in pain you can take an over-the-counter painkiller such
as paracetamol or ibuprofen. Make sure you take them according to the instructions
on the packet. Taking too much can be dangerous.



Drink plenty of fluids so that you don't get dehydrated.


If you're a smoker, now is a good time to give up. Smoking damages your lungs and
makes it more likely that you'll get pneumonia again. Your doctor can help you with
ways to stop smoking.



What will happen to me?
Pneumonia is serious and can sometimes be life threatening. But with prompt treatment
most people are completely cured.

If you have pneumonia that's caused by bacteria there's a good chance that antibiotics
will kill the bacteria and get rid of the infection.

But antibiotics don't work on viruses. Most of the time pneumonia that's caused by
a virus will get better without treatment.

How long it takes to get better depends on several things, including your age and
general health. If you're young and in good health, you'll probably get better sooner.

If you get treated quickly you should start to feel better in a few days. However,
it will take some time for you to feel as well as you did before you had pneumonia.
If you are older or have another condition that affects your health, it can take several
months before you feel as if you've made a complete recovery.

Your doctor might order a chest x-ray to make sure your pneumonia has cleared up,
especially if you're over 50 or if you smoke."

This vaccine is designed to protect against infection by a type of bacteria called
Streptococcus pneumoniae.

As the name suggests, this infection can cause pneumonia. But it also causes other
serious, and sometimes fatal infections, including meningitis and sepsis.

What are pneumococcal infections?
Pneumococcal infections are caused by a type of bacteria called Streptococcus pneumoniae. The most common infection that it causes is a type of pneumonia called pneumococcal pneumonia.

People of any age can get pneumonia. Severe pneumonia can cause death. In most people,
pneumonia causes the symptoms of a severe chest infection, such as:



fever


coughing


chest pain, and


breathing problems.


Pneumococcal infections can also cause other serious illnesses, including meningitis and sepsis.

Meningitis is inflammation (swelling) of the tissues that protect the brain and spinal cord.
These tissues are called the meninges.

This type of infection is not always caused by bacteria. Meningitis can also be caused
by infection with a virus or, rarely, a fungus. But these types of infection are usually
less serious.

Meningitis can sometimes be fatal. And people who recover are often affected for the
rest of their lives. Long-term problems caused by meningitis can include:



severe brain damage


hearing or vision problems


epilepsy


problems with memory and concentration


problems with movement and balance, and


needing to have limbs amputated.


Sepsis is when the body has an extreme reaction to an infection. It can be fatal if not
treated quickly.

Who needs the pneumococcal vaccination?
In many countries, the pneumococcal vaccine is first offered to people as babies.
For example, in the UK, babies are given two doses of the vaccine. The first is given at 12 weeks old and the second at 12 months of age.

But the vaccine can benefit other people at different ages. These include:


people with serious heart, kidney, or liver problems


people with diabetes, and


people aged over 65 years.


The vaccine given to babies is slightly different from the one given to older children
and adults.

This is because the vaccines that give the best protection for babies often don’t
work well for other people. So some vaccines are 'tweaked' to give the best protection
for certain age groups.

For more information on vaccination in older children and adults, see our leaflet
Pneumonia: do I need a vaccine?

Is there anyone who shouldn't have the vaccine?
You should tell your doctor if your baby has had an allergic reaction to any other vaccine. If this is the case, your baby might not be able to have the
vaccine.

You should also tell your doctor about any allergies that your baby has.

If your baby has a fever on the day of the vaccination appointment, you will probably be advised to delay
the vaccination and to make another appointment when your baby feels better.

Is it safe?
Like all vaccines, the pneumococcal vaccine can cause side effects in some babies.
The most serious is a severe allergic reaction. This is extremely rare, and the medical staff giving the vaccine will have been
trained in how to deal with it.

Another serious but rare side effect is a high fever that can lead to convulsions (fits).

Other side effects are usually mild and short lived. They include:


a slight fever


a reduced appetite


your baby being irritable for a while after the vaccination


redness and swelling where the injection was given (called the injection site)


your baby being more sleepy than usual, or having disturbed sleep.


How is the vaccination given?
The vaccine is given as an injection into the upper arm or thigh.
How well does the vaccine work?
Like most vaccines, the pneumococcal vaccine is not 100 percent effective in everyone,
all of the time. This means that some vaccinated children might still get a pneumococcal
infection.

But in countries with good vaccination programmes it has helped to hugely reduce the
number of these serious and potentially fatal infections. For example, meningitis
is now extremely rare in developed countries."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1499440499446/Pleural%20effusion,Pleural effusion,"Pleural effusion Last published: Aug 05, 2021
A pleural effusion is when too much fluid collects in the space between one of your
lungs and your chest wall. It usually happens as a complication of another condition.
The best treatment depends on what has caused the pleural effusion.
What is a pleural effusion?
The space between either one of your lungs and your chest wall is called the pleural
space. There is always a small amount of fluid in this space. This fluid acts as lubrication
so that your lungs can move easily against your chest wall when you move about.

If fluid collects in the pleural space faster than your body can remove it, this is
called a pleural effusion. It is usually caused by another condition. Small effusions
may not cause you much trouble.

But larger effusions can cause shortness of breath and pain. Large build-ups of fluid
may need to be drained.

Some of the many conditions that can cause a pleural effusion include:


heart failure


a lung infection such as pneumonia or tuberculosis


rheumatoid arthritis


cirrhosis of the liver


kidney failure


systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)


some cancers.


These conditions can cause a pleural effusion in a number of ways. Two of the most
common are:



when fluid leaks from blood vessels into the pleural space, as can happen with heart
failure



when a condition such as cancer or an infection causes swelling in the lungs, which
leads to a build-up of fluid in the pleural space.



What are the symptoms?
The main symptom of a large pleural effusion is shortness of breath. You may also feel some pain in your chest and have a cough. But many people with a pleural effusion don’t feel any pain.

Your doctor can get a good idea of whether you have a pleural effusion with just a
simple examination. For example, he or she will listen to your breathing. If your
breathing is not as loud in some parts of your lungs as it should be, this suggests
that you might have a pleural effusion.

Your doctor will also gently tap your back with his or her fingers. If this makes
a very dull sound over part of your lung it’s another sign that you might have a pleural
effusion.

To help understand what has caused the pleural effusion your doctor will ask you what
other medical conditions you have now or have had in the past, and what medications
you are taking or have taken in the past. A pleural effusion can sometimes be caused
by certain medicines.

You will also need to have some tests, including a chest x-ray and possibly a scan.
Blood tests can also help to show if you have an infection that could be causing a
pleural effusion.

What treatments are available?
The treatment you are offered will depend on what has caused the build-up of fluid.
Treating the condition that has caused the pleural effusion can often get rid of the
effusion itself.

For example:


if heart failure is the cause, then medicines called diuretics can help. These drugs help the body to get rid of excess fluid



if an infection such as pneumonia has caused the pleural effusion then antibiotics will usually cure the infection.



If the build-up of fluid is small, treating the cause can often get rid of the effusion
itself.

But no matter what the cause is, if you have a large build-up of fluid that is causing
you breathing problems your doctor might give you oxygen to help you breathe before any other treatments.

Large build-ups of fluid may also need to be drained. If you have this type of fluid
drainage you will be given a local anaesthetic to numb the area and reduce pain. A needle
is then inserted so that the fluid can drain out through a tube.

Some people need to have this procedure more than once. And some people need to have
a permanent chest drain fitted to drain fluid that keeps building up. For example,
this is sometimes needed for people having long-term cancer treatment.

A treatment called pleurodesis is sometimes used to reduce the chance of pleural effusions happening again. It involves
injecting a drug into the pleural space that causes the lung and chest wall to stick
to each other, almost as if they had been glued together.

If your doctor thinks this treatment might help you, he or she should discuss it in
detail with you, including:



how likely it is to work


the possible benefits


any possible risks, and


the likelihood of having another pleural effusion if you choose not to have the procedure.


Your doctor can advise you, but the final choice about whether to have the procedure
is yours.

What to expect in the future
Some health problems make pleural effusions more likely to return. These include heart
failure, cirrhosis, and cancer. But most people who have a pleural effusion don’t
have another one.

If you have had a pleural effusion drained, or if you have had pleurodesis, your doctor
will advise you to avoid certain activities for a while, including air travel.

This is because changes in environmental pressure can cause problems with your lungs
after chest treatments. These problems can happen either with:



reduced air pressure at high altitude, or


increased water pressure caused by underwater diving.


If you start to have symptoms again after your treatment, see your doctor straight
away."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/3000074/Phobias,Phobias,"Phobias Last published: Aug 30, 2022
If you have a phobia about something it means you are scared or anxious when faced
with it, or when you think about it. People can have phobias about just about anything.
But the most common ones are about certain animals, small spaces, or needles.

Treatment for phobias usually works well. You can use our information to talk to your
doctor about getting the help you need.

What are phobias?
Phobias are common.


About 10 in 100 people have a phobia at some point in their lives.


Phobias are more common in women than in men.


Phobias are most common when people are in their teenage years, and less common in
children and as people get older.



Many people have more than one phobia.


Having a phobia means having intense fear about certain things or situations. This
can either be when you are face to face with them, or just when you expect to be.

Most phobias don’t cause too many problems most of the time: for example, a common
phobia is fear of snakes. But snakes are easy to avoid for most people. But some phobias
can disrupt your daily life and make you scared to do simple things.

Common phobias include:


some animals (usually dogs, snakes, spiders, and insects)


flying


enclosed spaces (claustrophobia)


heights


storms


the dark, and


needles.


What are the symptoms?
The symptoms of a phobia usually begin during mid to late childhood, but they can
develop at any age. Some people can recall a specific event that triggered the start
of their phobia, but many can’t.

Phobia symptoms might seem obvious. But it is helpful to look at them in some detail,
because they are different from a normal level of fear or anxiety.

For example, most people don’t really like spiders and wouldn’t want to handle them.
But it doesn’t bother them most of the time and it doesn’t interfere with their lives.

Having a phobia is different. It can cause severe anxiety and stress that affects
your quality of life.

Phobia symptoms include:


severe anxiety or panic when you’re faced with the thing you have a phobia about,
or when you know you are about to be faced with it



losing sleep or getting depressed because of your phobia


avoiding any situation where you think you might come face to face with the thing
you have a phobia about



using alcohol or drugs to help calm your nerves or reduce anxiety


fainting when you’re faced with what you have a phobia about. For example, a lot of
people with a needle phobia faint when they have to have an injection.



What treatments work?
Therapy
The main treatment for phobias is a type of psychotherapy (‘talking treatment’) called
cognitive behaviour therapy, or CBT for short.

The aims of CBT are to:


ease your anxiety


help you get to the point where you no longer need to avoid what scares you


reduce the negative effect that your phobia has on your life.


CBT works well for most people. But it depends on you being willing to work with your
therapist to get the most out of your therapy.

It’s possible that CBT won’t be easily available in your area, or that it is not available
straight away. So you might have to wait a while for treatment.

With CBT you have one or more sessions with a therapist. He or she will try to help
you deal with your phobia using various methods, including:



helping you to learn about phobias


helping you to learn about what you are afraid of: it’s easier to not be scared of
something when you know a lot about it



challenging negative ways of thinking


gradually facing the thing that you fear over time (you might hear this called ‘graduated
exposure’) in a safe and controlled way, and



suggesting ways to help you relax.


Graduated exposure
The idea of graduated exposure might sound scary to begin with, because it involves
facing your fear. But it is one of the most important and useful parts of CBT for
phobias. And it is done slowly, in a controlled and safe way.

For example, if you have a phobia about spiders, the therapy might start with you
and your therapist just talking about spiders. The next step might be to briefly look
at a picture of a spider.

You might then start to look at pictures for longer, then finally look at a spider
in a jar, or even let one crawl on your hand.

Graduated exposure therapy can be done with a therapist. But it can also be done online,
with computer-based therapy. Some phobia treatments can also now be done using virtual
reality.

Needles and fainting
Many people with a needle phobia faint when they need to have an injection. A technique
called applied tension therapy can help you not to faint.

It involves repeatedly tensing the muscles in your arms, abdomen (tummy), and legs.
This increases your blood pressure so that you’re less likely to faint. After you
have practised this technique for a week or so, you can use it just before you have
an injection.

Your doctor can give you more detailed advice on how and when to do it.
Medicines
Medicines are not generally useful for treating phobias. But there are a few situations
in which they might be used.



Anti-anxiety medicines might be used to help people relax in the short term - for
example, during some stressful medical procedures - but they probably don’t help in
the long term.



Some people might also be prescribed antidepressants if their phobia causes them depression.


Some people might need medications to help them sleep if their phobia causes them
insomnia.



Like all medicines, the types sometimes prescribed for phobias can cause side effects.
Your doctor should discuss these with you. If you get side effects, talk to your doctor.
You might be able to change medications.

Phobias in children
It’s common for children to be scared of things. For example, many children are afraid
of the dark, or of some animals. But childhood fears tend to fade with time and don’t
usually turn into phobias.

When children do develop phobias, the treatment is similar to that for adults. But
therapy sessions can also involve the child’s parents. You can talk to your doctor
about how treatment will work for your child.

What will happen?
You might decide that you can live with your phobias without treatment. But for some
people, leaving their phobias untreated can lead to depression and severe anxiety.

Treatment for phobias works well for most people and can make a big difference to
people’s lives.

There is other support available, too. For example, you can find help online, through
support groups and people who are happy to share their experiences of phobias and
dealing with them.

Your doctor might be able to help you find support in your area."

Personality disorders can cause difficulties with how we interact with other people.
There are several types of personality disorder and they affect people in different
ways. But they all affect how we think, deal with our feelings, and get on with others.

What are personality disorders?
If you find that you think or behave differently from most people in ways that distress
you, and that you can’t control, you might be affected by a personality disorder.


Personality disorders are fairly common, and there are several types, which have different
symptoms. But they all affect people in some similar ways, including:



the way you think about and understand yourself, other people, and the world around
you



how much you can control your moods and emotions


the way you get along with other people, including family and friends


how much you can control how you behave and speak to people. Doctors call this ‘impulse
control’.



It can be distressing to be told by a doctor that you might have a personality disorder.
But it doesn’t mean that you’re a ‘bad’ person or that anyone is judging you. In fact,
it can be really helpful to finally understand why you think and behave in some of
the ways that you do, and that you find hard to control.

It’s not clear what causes personality disorders. Some people are simply born with
them as part of the genes they inherit from their parents. But some things that happen
to people can make personality disorders more likely.

What treatments work?
Trust and continuity
Getting help with a personality disorder can be hard to begin with. First, either
you or your doctor needs to realise that there is a problem. But that’s only the start
of the process.

Many people with personality disorders find it hard to trust people, especially if
talking about their feelings makes them anxious. And some people with personality
disorders might be reluctant to ask for help even when they need it.

What seems most important for people with this condition is that they establish a
long-term, trusting relationship with one doctor or support worker who they feel safe
with and who they can go to when they are having difficulties.

This doesn’t mean that you can call or visit your doctor whenever it suits you. Your
doctor will have plenty of other patients, as well as a life of his or her own. You
will need to agree rules of when and how you contact your doctor at the start of your
treatment.

You should also be involved in your treatment from the start. For example, your doctor
will want you to be involved in making decisions about what you want from your treatment,
and how to achieve it. Your family might also be involved, as well as support groups
in your area.

Treatment for people in immediate danger
Some people need urgent help straight away. This includes people:


who are at risk of self-harm or suicide


who might not be able to take care of their children, or


who might neglect or harm their children.


If you need urgent help for any of these reasons, your doctor should refer you to
emergency psychiatric services immediately.

Many people with personality disorders abuse alcohol or drugs. This is usually because
it can make them feel less anxious in the short term. But it makes people feel worse
over time, as the drugs or alcohol cause other mental-health problems.

If you have been abusing drugs or alcohol, you might need detoxification (detox) treatment
before any other treatment can start.

Psychotherapy
Once you are in no immediate danger, the main treatment for personality disorders
is psychotherapy. This means regularly meeting with a psychiatrist or psychologist,
to discuss how you feel, and talk about ways to help you.

Psychotherapy is tailored to whatever will help you most. It will probably include
help with how to deal with other people, and how to control your impulses. But it
could also include things like:



advice on good diet


help with substance abuse, and


help with how to do your best for your children.


Medicines
There are some medicines that can help people with personality disorders. They can
help you feel less anxious and more in control of your moods. Depending on your individual
needs, your doctor might recommend one or more of the following medicines:



Antidepressants. These drugs are usually used to help with depression. But they can also help with
some personality disorders.



Antipsychotics can help if you are having strange thoughts that you can’t control.



Mood stabilisers do what their name suggests. They can help you control your moods.



Anticonvulsants are usually used to help people with epilepsy. But they can help people with personality
disorders to feel more calm.



All medicines cause side effects in some people. Your doctor should explain the ones
that you might get. If you find that your medicines cause unpleasant side effects,
talk to your doctor. You might be able to change to a different medicine.

If you are a girl or woman of childbearing age, your doctor should not usually prescribe
a mood stabiliser called valproate unless there are no other options. This is because
valproate causes serious birth defects in babies.

If you need to take valproate, your doctor should discuss the risks with you, and
make a plan with you so that you don’t become pregnant.

Specialist services
In some areas, specialist services for people with personality disorders bring together
many of the treatments discussed above. These services are not available everywhere.
But ask your doctor where you can get the best help.

What will happen?
It’s not possible to say what will happen to you as an individual. Treatment can’t
‘cure’ personality disorders. But it can help people to deal with their anxiety and
social issues, among other things.

And perhaps most important, treatment can help people to understand and be more at
ease with themselves.

Treatment takes time, and you will need to have regular follow-up appointments with
your doctor and mental-health professional.

Personality disorders are common, and they affect all kinds of ordinary people. And
there is plenty of help and advice available if you look online, including from people
who are happy to share their own stories to help others like themselves. Your doctor
might be able to direct you to a support group in your area."

Personality disorders can cause difficulties with how we interact with other people.
There are several types of personality disorder and they affect people in different
ways. But they all affect how we think, deal with our feelings, and get on with others.

What are personality disorders?
Each one of us thinks and behaves in different ways. For example, some people are
more shy than others, and some people don’t find it easy meeting new people, or socialising
in large groups.

All these things are normal and they don’t usually cause people any major problems.
But if you find that you think or behave differently from most people in ways that
distress you, and that you can’t control, you might be affected by a personality disorder.

Personality disorders are fairly common, and there are several types, which have different

how much you can control your moods and emotions


the way you interact and get along with other people, including family and friends


how much you can control how you behave and speak to people. Doctors call this ‘impulse
control’.



Many people with personality disorders don’t know that they have them. They might
only know that they feel somehow ‘different’ from most people a lot of the time, and
that they often feel distressed for reasons they can’t quite pin down.

Many people don’t know anything about personality disorders until they see a doctor
for another reason, such as depression. Their doctor might then see the signs of a
personality disorder and suggest that they have treatment for it.

It can be distressing to be told by a doctor that you might have a personality disorder.
But it doesn’t mean that you’re a ‘bad’ person or that anyone is judging you. In fact,
it can be really helpful to finally understand why you think and behave in some of
the ways that you do, and that you find hard to control.

Doctors divide personality disorders into 10 types. Some of the names for these types
can sound quite scary and medical. But they help doctors to understand and help with
your particular difficulties.



Schizotypal personality disorder: With this type of personality disorder you have trouble interacting with other people
and can struggle to form close relationships. You might also see and understand the
world in ways that most people think are odd, and you might behave in ways that most
people find eccentric. You might also be anxious in social situations, even in places
and with people you know well.



Schizoid personality disorder: You might seem distant or detached in your relationships, and you might struggle
to express your feelings. You tend to prefer your own company to that of others.



Paranoid personality disorder: You might distrust or feel suspicious of other people more than is normal. You might
find it hard not to bear grudges, and you feel threatened in situations where most
people wouldn’t.



Avoidant personality disorder: You might struggle in social situations, feel shy and inadequate, and react badly
to criticism. Fear of rejection might make you scared about taking risks in your personal
life.



Dependent personality disorder: You might have a very strong need to be taken care of, to the point where you are
‘clingy’ and don’t stand up for yourself in your relationships. You might struggle
to make decisions on your own. The fear that you can’t look after yourself might make
you scared to be alone.



Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder: You spend a lot of time thinking about neatness, order, and perfection - not just
with regard to things, but in relationships, where you like to be in control. This
might mean that people see you as not being flexible, or open, or relaxed. They might
see you as stubborn, and too devoted to work.



Borderline personality disorder: You might struggle to keep a stable relationship going, and you might have low self-esteem.
You might also struggle to control your moods, and sometimes be impulsive and angry
for very little reason. You might sometimes suddenly think about self-harm or suicide.



Histrionic personality disorder: You get emotional about things very easily. You also find yourself doing things
just to seek attention - maybe through the way you dress. You might feel uneasy when
you’re not the centre of attention. People might see you as emotionally shallow.



Narcissistic personality disorder: You might have big, grand fantasies about your life, and behave as if you are special,
and more important than other people. You might have a strong need to be admired,
and struggle to consider other people’s feelings. You might find yourself taking advantage
of people for your own gain.



Antisocial personality disorder: You might have little regard for the rights of other people. You often act on impulse
and are dishonest when it suits you to be. You might feel little or no remorse when
you do things other people think are wrong. You might do things that are illegal or
not thought to be socially acceptable.



Personality disorder not otherwise specified (NOS): This means that you might have some of the traits of more than one personality disorder,
or that you might behave in ways that are troubled and distressing, but that don’t
fit any of the other types.



It’s not clear what causes personality disorders. Some people are simply born with
them as part of the genes they inherit from their parents. But some things that happen
to people can make personality disorders more likely.

For example, people who were neglected as children, or who were physically or sexually
abused, are more likely than usual to have a personality disorder.

What are the symptoms?
Most people with personality disorders live with them for many years before they realise
that they are affected by one. This can cause long-term distress and problems.

It’s very common for people not to be diagnosed until they see a doctor for another
reason, who then notices the symptoms of a personality disorder. The doctor might
see the symptoms in the patient’s behaviour, or he or she might notice a pattern of
behaviour from the patient’s medical records.

The kinds of things the doctor might notice in someone with the signs of a personality
disorder include:



stress and anger out of proportion to the situation


making unrealistic demands of the doctor or medical staff


scars or other marks on the skin caused by self-harm


a tendency to start or get involved in arguments easily


long-term problems in controlling moods or anxiety


regular abuse of drugs or alcohol


issues that might suggest that someone has a troubled or traumatic home life. This
applies more to children.



If a doctor notices that you have any of these kinds of symptoms, he or she might
ask you questions about how you feel and about your life. After talking with you for
a while, the doctor might be closer to making a diagnosis of some type of personality
disorder.

The doctor might not be sure which type of disorder you might have. But he or she
will be looking for symptoms that fall into three broad categories:



Symptoms around how you think and see the world. This might include rigidly held ideas,
strange ways of thinking, and misunderstanding (getting the ‘wrong end of the stick’)
about other people’s intentions.



Having trouble controlling your moods, and being constantly anxious.


Having problems with impulse control. This might mean being aggressive, self-harming,
having casual sex without thinking about the consequences, and abusing drugs and alcohol.



What will happen?
It’s not possible to say what will happen to you as an individual. The main treatment
for personality disorders is psychotherapy or other ���talking treatments’.

Treatment can’t ‘cure’ personality disorders. But it can help people to deal with
their anxiety and social issues, among other things. And perhaps most important, it
can help people to understand and be more at ease with themselves.

Treatment takes time, and you will need to have regular follow-up appointments with
your doctor and mental-health professional.

https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/3000284/Persistent%20depressive%20disorder%20%28long-term%20depression%29,Persistent depressive disorder (long-term depression),"Persistent depressive disorder (long-term depression) Last published: Aug 25, 2022
Many people have episodes of depression that come on suddenly and can last for months.
But if you've got depression that doesn’t go away, or if you keep having bouts of
major depression, your doctor may say that you have persistent depressive disorder,
or PDD for short.

Treatments for long-term depression can work very well to control the condition. If
you have problems with long-term depression you can use our information to talk about
the best treatments for you.

What is persistent depressive disorder?
Most people will be affected by a mental health issue at some time, even if only for
a short while.

Depression is often like this. A life event, an illness, or a cause that we never
really understand can trigger a bout of depression that we need help with.

Doctors call that acute depression. The word 'acute' means something that comes on quickly and doesn’t last a long time.

Persistent depressive disorder (PDD) is different. You may hear it called long-term depression or chronic depression. The word 'chronic' means something that lasts a long time.

PDD is not the same for everyone. There are several types that all come under the
heading of PDD. But they all involve symptoms of depression for more days than not,
for at least two years.

Types of PDD include:


A long-lasting low-level depression. This is not major depression, but it’s enough
to affect your life so that treatment would help



A major depression that doesn’t go away


Recurring episodes of major depression, or


Low-level depression that sometimes gets worse and becomes major depression. You may
have heard this called double depression.



Many people with long-term depression also have problems with anxiety.

About 2 in 100 men and 4 in 100 women have problems with long-term depression. It
usually affects adults, but it can also start when someone is a child or teenager.

It’s not always possible to say what causes PDD in an individual person. But we know
that causes can include:



Ongoing stress


Other long-term medical conditions. For example, health problems that cause constant
pain or tiredness can often be linked to depression, and



Stressful life events, such as the death of a loved one, money problems, or the end
of a relationship.



What are the symptoms?
Generally, doctors would say that you have persistent low-level depression if you have at least two symptoms for most of the day on most days. These symptoms
include:



Low self-esteem (feelings of worthlessness)


Struggling to concentrate


Finding it hard to make decisions


Feeling hopeless


Unusual eating habits. This could mean either a poor appetite or over-eating


Unusual sleep patterns. This could mean either insomnia (having trouble sleeping)
or sleeping too much, and



Fatigue (extreme tiredness).


Doctors would say that an episode of major depression would involve having many of the symptoms every day for at least two weeks. These
symptoms include:



Depressed mood


Reduced interest in your usual activities


Sleeping too much or not enough


Over- or under-eating


Agitation


Slow thinking or slow physical movements


Fatigue or low energy


Feelings of worthlessness or guilt


Difficulty concentrating, and


Suicidal thoughts.


There are several physical conditions that can cause some of the symptoms of depression,
or that can make them worse. So your doctor may suggest some tests to rule them out.
These would usually be blood tests.

For example, they may want to check for:


Any vitamin deficiencies


Thyroid problems


Problems with your liver, and


Problems with your blood: for example, anaemia.


What treatments are available?
The treatments that can help with long-term depression are broadly the same as those
for shorter-term spells of depression: namely antidepressant medicines, psychotherapy ('talking treatments'), or a combination of both.

The difference is that people with longer-term depression tend to need more treatment.
This usually means:



A longer treatment period


More sessions of psychotherapy, and


Higher doses of medicine.


There is some evidence that medicines may work better than psychotherapy for PDD.
It’s also possible that a combination of treatments may work better than just one
of them.

Antidepressant medicines
There are many different antidepressants, and you and your doctor can discuss which
one may be right for you.

These medicines all take several weeks, and sometimes longer, before they start to
work properly. So it may take a while before you feel better.

All antidepressants can cause side effects in some people, especially when you first start taking them. These can include things
such as stomach problems, agitation, and sexual problems. Your doctor should discuss
these with you before you start treatment.

If you find that your medicine causes side effects that don’t go away, talk to your
doctor. You may be able to try a different medicine or a lower dose.

Psychotherapy (talking treatments)
Several talking treatments have been found to be useful for PDD.
Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) involves your therapist helping you change the way you think and feel about things
that make you unhappy. For example, you may:



Break down your worries or problems into smaller chunks to deal with them more easily,
and



Look at whether your reactions to problems are helpful or realistic, and at how you
may react more usefully.



Interpersonal therapy (IPT) is used to help people whose depression is probably linked to problems with relationships.
The aim is to improve relationships with people that are causing you to be depressed.

For example, it may help you if you have been through the end of a marriage or relationship,
or if you are struggling with relationships with friends or family members.

Other things that may help
Many people try non-medical treatments for long-term depression, including taking
regular exercise, eating a more healthy diet, yoga, and acupuncture.

There is some evidence that these things can be helpful, especially exercise.
Treatment during pregnancy
Not all antidepressants are considered safe to take during pregnancy. For example,
some can lead to problems for the baby for several hours or days after they are born.

But stopping treatment during pregnancy could also affect you and your baby.
So, if you are planning on becoming pregnant, talk to your doctor about your treatment
options. For example, you may want to consider changing your medicine to one that
is considered safe.

If that isn’t possible, you and your doctor should discuss what’s best for you and
your baby. There may not be easy answers. But you can at least prepare yourself as
much as possible.

Treatment in children and teenagers
PDD can affect children and young people. But most antidepressant medicines are not
usually recommended, as they can cause suicidal thoughts in younger people.

Depending on where you live, your child may be able to be given antidepressants, but
they will need to be closely monitored for signs of their symptoms getting worse.

What to expect in the future
Many people’s symptoms go away after a period of treatment. But it takes longer for
treatment to work in people with PDD compared to those with shorter-term bouts of
depression.

PDD is also a long-term condition, so symptoms can sometimes return. But if treatment
helped a lot the first time, it is likely to do so again.

The outlook is less good for people whose symptoms only partly improve with treatment.
Long-term treatment with antidepressants can cause symptoms that take longer to appear,
such as weight gain and sexual problems. Your doctor should discuss these with you.

You may not need to have treatment for the amount of time it takes for long-term symptoms
to appear. But it’s useful to be as prepared as you can."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1584226920820/Peripheral%20arterial%20disease,Peripheral arterial disease,"Peripheral arterial disease Last published: Sep 27, 2021
Peripheral arterial disease means that not enough blood is getting to your legs. This
can cause pain when you walk.

What is peripheral arterial disease?
If you have peripheral arterial disease (PAD for short), the blood vessels (arteries)
that carry blood around your body have become too narrow. When the arteries taking
blood to your legs are too narrow, not enough oxygen and nutrients get to your muscles
or skin. If you don't have treatment this can damage your legs.

Arteries become narrow when clumps of fat (called plaques) build up inside the artery
wall. If the plaques break off they can cause blood clots that block the artery.

If the arteries in your legs are narrow, other arteries to your heart and brain may
also be too narrow. This increases your chance of a heart attack or stroke.

You are more likely to get PAD if you smoke or if you have diabetes. Other things
that make it more likely are:



being older


having high blood pressure


having high cholesterol


being overweight, and


not taking much exercise.


What are the symptoms?
At first you may not know there is anything wrong. Many people with PAD don't get
any symptoms and don't know that they have it. But as your PAD gets worse you might
get aches or cramps in your calf, thigh, foot, or buttock when you walk.

Doctors call this intermittent claudication.
If your PAD gets more severe:


you might have pain in your legs even when you’re sitting down


you might have cuts, bruises, or ulcers on the skin of your legs or feet that don’t
heal properly, and



your feet might change colour.


People with very severe PAD may need to have the limb amputated.
Your doctor will ask about your symptoms, examine you, and take your blood pressure.
He or she will also check your pulse at different points on your body including your
knee, ankle, and foot.

If your doctor is not sure whether you have PAD, you’ll be referred to a specialist
for more tests.

What treatments work?
There are many treatments that can help improve your symptoms and reduce your chances
of getting other health problems. You will probably need to take medicines every day
for the rest of your life. There are also things you can do to help yourself.

Things you can do for yourself
Taking regular exercise (at least three times a week) should help you to be able to
walk further and exercise for longer before you get leg pain. Exercising can improve
the blood supply to your legs and help the muscles of your legs to work more efficiently.

Your doctor can advise what exercise is best for you. You might be put on an exercise
programme when you first get PAD, to help relieve your symptoms.

Stopping smoking is very important. People with PAD who stop smoking are less likely
to die early, have a heart attack, or need to have a limb amputated.

Keeping warm is important, because cold constricts your blood vessels. Don’t use decongestant
medicines for colds and hay fever.

If you have PAD and diabetes, you need to take your diabetes medicines as agreed with
your doctor, and take good care of your feet. You should see a podiatrist regularly
to check your feet.

Medicines
Antiplatelet medicines include aspirin and clopidogrel. These drugs reduce the chance
of blood clots forming in your arteries by making your blood less sticky. They also
make it less likely that you will have a heart attack or stroke, die early, or need
an operation to unblock an artery in your leg.

The most common side effect of antiplatelet medicines is bleeding.
As well as antiplatelet medicines, you are likely to need medicines to lower your
blood pressure. There are many types and you can discuss with your doctor which is
right for you.

Taking medicines called statins to reduce your cholesterol might stop your PAD getting
worse. These medicines can help reduce the build-up of plaques in your arteries. People
with PAD who take statins are less likely to have a heart attack or stroke or to die
early.

If drug treatments and exercise don't reduce your symptoms, and you have trouble walking,
you might be offered drugs called vasodilators that can relax your blood vessels.
They might help you to walk further without pain.

Surgery
If the arteries to your leg get very narrow, you might need an operation to widen
them or to bypass the most damaged parts.

In an operation called percutaneous transluminal angiography (also known as angioplasty
or PTA), a doctor uses a tiny balloon to widen the part of your artery that is blocked.
He or she might then insert a small tube, called a stent, into the artery to try to
keep it open.

Another possible treatment is bypass surgery. This means taking a small piece of a
healthy vein from your leg, or using an artificial vein, and stitching it into your
damaged artery, so that blood can pass through.

Like any surgery, both types of operation have some risks. You should discuss these
with your doctor before you decide whether to go ahead with surgery.

What will happen to me?
Everyone is different, so it's hard to say what will happen to you. Your symptoms
might improve, stay the same, or gradually get worse.

If you have PAD, you have an increased chance of having a heart attack or stroke.
Some people whose legs become badly damaged need to have a leg amputated. But this
is rare. Having treatment can reduce the chance of this happening.

You will probably need to see your doctor at least once a year for a check-up, to
make sure your PAD is not getting worse."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/3000056/Pericarditis,Pericarditis,"Pericarditis Last published: Aug 30, 2022
Pericarditis is painful inflammation (swelling) of the sac that surrounds and protects
the heart. Pericarditis is often simple to treat, but it can have serious complications.
What is pericarditis?
The heart is loosely contained in a sac called the pericardium. This sac helps protect the heart. It also contains a small amount of fluid that
helps to lubricate the heart and keep it working smoothly.

If the pericardium becomes inflamed it is called pericarditis. The main symptom of
this inflammation is chest pain.

Pericarditis can often be treated fairly easily. But in some people it is more serious.
For example, if fluid begins to fill the pericardium, or if the swelling affects the
blood flow to and from the heart, it can be life threatening.

It’s often not possible to tell what has caused pericarditis. But the most common
cause seems to be a viral infection.

Pericarditis can also be caused by a bacterial infection in the lungs called tuberculosis,
and by other types of bacterial or fungal infection. But these causes are rare.

There are some things that make getting pericarditis more likely. They include:


being male


having had a heart attack in the past


having had heart surgery in the past


having dialysis treatment for kidney disease


having what’s called an autoimmune condition. This is where the body’s immune system,
which normally protects us from infection, starts to attack some of the body’s own
tissues. Common autoimmune conditions include rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory
bowel diseases, such as Crohn’s disease.




What are the symptoms?
The main symptom of pericarditis is pain in the centre of the chest. In many people
the pain spreads out on both sides to cover all of the chest.

The pain can either be sharp or more like an ache. Most people find that the pain
is worse when they lie down and gets better when they sit up or lean forward.

You might also have a fever and a cough, but this is less common.
Chest pain can be a sign of serious problems, including a heart attack. So it’s important
to see a doctor urgently if you have chest pain. If you have severe chest pain, or
if you think you might be having a heart attack, call an ambulance.

If your doctor thinks you might have pericarditis, he or she will ask about your symptoms,
examine you, and listen to your chest through a stethoscope for any unusual sounds.


Your doctor might also want to do some tests, including blood tests, a chest x-ray,
and an electrocardiogram (ECG).

Pericarditis is not usually dangerous, and the swelling is often simple to treat.
But sometimes the pericardium can fill with pus. This is called purulent pericarditis.
Purulent pericarditis is life threatening because it can stop the heart from working
properly. It needs immediate treatment.

Purulent pericarditis is a sign of a serious infection. Your doctor will draw out
some of the fluid with a needle. It will then be tested to see what has caused the
infection. This means that the infection can be targeted with the right treatment.


What treatments are available?
The treatment you will need depends on what has caused the inflammation in the pericardium.


You might need to stay in hospital until your doctor has found the cause of your pericarditis.
But if you don’t have any complications, such as fever, or fluid in the pericardium,
you can usually go home and be treated as an outpatient.

Medicines
The main treatment for most people with pericarditis is to take medicines called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). These drugs reduce the inflammation. NSAIDs that you might have heard of include
ibuprofen and aspirin. You will probably need to take these for several weeks.

NSAIDs can cause irritation of the stomach lining. So your doctor might also prescribe
a medicine to protect your stomach while you take the NSAID. If your chest pain is
severe, your doctor might also prescribe a stronger painkiller.

If the cause of your pericarditis is not clear, or if you don’t get better within
two weeks, your doctor might prescribe a stronger anti-inflammatory drug, called a
steroid (the full name is corticosteroid).

Your doctor will also advise you not to do any vigorous exercise until he or she is
happy that you no longer have pericarditis.

If you have pericarditis that comes back after treatment you may need to take other
anti-inflammatory medicines for several months. If your doctor thinks your pericarditis
might be linked to a problem with your immune system, he or she might also suggest
medicines that help stop your immune system from attacking your body.

Surgery
If drug treatments have not cured your pericarditis, your doctor might suggest that
you have an operation called a pericardectomy. This means removing part or all of the pericardium.

If you need to have this operation it means that the pericardium isn’t doing its job
any more. So removing part or all of it shouldn’t cause problems. The heart can usually
work normally without it.

If your pericardium has begun to fill with pus you might need surgery to drain the
fluid. You will then need to take antibiotics to fight the infection and anti-inflammatories
to reduce the swelling in the pericardium.

What to expect in the future
Most people with pericarditis that’s caused by a virus, and that gets better with
NSAIDs, don’t need any long-term follow-up treatment.

For pericarditis with other causes, the outlook can be more serious. For example,
about 40 in 100 people who have purulent pericarditis die from the condition, even
with treatment.

If you have pericarditis that was caused by tuberculosis or another bacterial infection,
complications are more likely, and your doctor will want to check on you regularly."

If the lining of your stomach or your upper intestine (gut) gets damaged it can cause
an ulcer. Peptic ulcers are sometimes called stomach ulcers or duodenal ulcers. They
can be very painful but there are treatments that can help.

You can use our information to talk to your doctor and decide which treatments are
best for you.

What are peptic ulcers?
There are two kinds of peptic ulcer. One type happens in the upper intestine (called
the duodenum), the other in the stomach. Both can be very painful.

Duodenal ulcers happen when the lining of your duodenum gets damaged and acid from your stomach goes
through the damaged lining to the tissue underneath.

Most duodenal ulcers are caused by one of the bacteria (germs) that can live in your
stomach, called Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori for short).

Stomach ulcers happen when the lining of your stomach gets damaged and acid from your stomach goes
through the damaged lining to the tissue underneath.

Most stomach ulcers are caused by taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs
for short), which can lead to damage of the lining of the stomach.

Other, less common, causes of peptic ulcers include:


multiple organ failure, which can lead to problems with the digestive system, including
'stress ulcers'



a condition called Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, where a tumour leads to the production
of too much acid in the stomach



certain medicines, including potassium chloride and drugs called bisphosphonates


some infections, and


Crohn's disease, which is an inflammatory disease of the intestines.


What are the symptoms?
Peptic ulcers can be painful. Some people say it feels like a burning pain between
their breastbone and belly button. The pain is usually worse when your stomach is
empty, between meals. It might get better if you eat or if you take antacids (such
as Gaviscon, Rennie, or Tums).

You might also get heartburn, feel bloated, or have wind. But having one or two of
these symptoms doesn't usually mean you have a stomach ulcer.

Stomach problems can sometimes be a sign of a more serious illness. If you have black
stools, or if you are vomiting blood, you should call your doctor or go to an accident
and emergency department as soon as possible. You could have bleeding in your stomach
or your intestine.

You should also tell your doctor if you:


feel that food sticks in your throat when you swallow


are losing weight without trying, or


are feeling tired for no reason.


Your doctor might suggest some more tests, especially if you are aged over 55. But
most people who have these tests turn out not to have anything seriously wrong.

What treatments work?
Treatment for peptic ulcers is aimed at treating the cause of the ulcer and healing
the ulcer itself.

Your doctor might want to do a test called an endoscopy before starting treatment.
This involves passing a small camera through a tube in your throat into your stomach
so that the doctor can see your ulcer.

The images from the camera will help your doctor make the best treatment decisions.
For example, he or she will be able to see if your ulcer is bleeding, which requires
urgent treatment. Your doctor will also be able to tell whether your ulcer is in the
duodenum or the stomach.

Emergency treatment for bleeding ulcers
If tests, such as an endoscopy, show that your ulcer is bleeding, you will need to
be admitted to hospital straight away.

The bleeding can usually be stopped by operating using an endoscope. This means that
the bleeding can be stopped by instruments passed down the throat rather than by standard
surgery.

If endoscopic treatment doesn't stop the bleeding, or if the ulcer has perforated
(made a hole in the wall of the stomach) then standard surgery will be necessary.

After the surgery you will be tested for H. pylori and treated for the infection if necessary.

Treatment for ulcers in people without H. pylori infection

Most peptic ulcers in the stomach are caused by long-term use of medicines called
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs for short). Ones that you might have
heard of include aspirin, ibuprofen, diclofenac, and naproxen.

These medicines are used to relieve inflammation (swelling) and pain. They can help
many people with conditions such as arthritis, but they can sometimes cause problems,
including stomach ulcers.

If you have been taking NSAIDs, and tests show that you don't have an H. pylori infection, use of NSAIDs is the most likely cause of an ulcer. So your doctor will
advise you to stop taking those drugs right away.

If this is not possible, or if you are taking prescribed low-dose aspirin because
you have a heart condition, your doctor might prescribe an additional medicine to
protect the lining of your stomach, and might suggest changing your pain medicine
to something less likely to aggravate your ulcer.

The next step is to help the ulcer to heal. The usual treatment is taking tablets
called proton pump inhibitors. These drugs reduce the amount of acid the stomach produces.
Most people need to have this treatment for about four weeks.

Treatment for ulcers in people with H. pylori infection

Most peptic ulcers in the duodenum (duodenal ulcers) are caused by H. pylori infection.

There are simple tests that can tell your doctor if you have H. pylori. Your doctor might do a breath test or ask you for a stool sample. There's a blood
test, too, but it's not as accurate. If tests show that you have H. pylori in your stomach, killing the bacteria can help get rid of your ulcer.

Most people who have treatment for H. pylori get rid of their ulcer. Getting rid of H. pylori also means that your ulcer is less likely to come back.

The treatment for people with an ulcer caused by H. pylori usually consists of three drugs: two antibiotics to kill the H. pylori bacteria, and a proton pump inhibitor to reduce stomach acid while the ulcer is healing.

It's important to carefully follow the instructions on how to take the antibiotics.
For example, don't stop taking the antibiotics if your symptoms go away after a few
days: finish the course of treatment.

If you don't take all the antibiotics there's a chance that not all the bacteria will
be killed and the infection will return, stronger, and harder to kill than before.
This is called 'antibiotic resistance' and it is a serious and growing problem.

If this treatment doesn't work your doctor might suggest different antibiotics, and
possibly another drug called bismuth, which can help the ulcer heal.

Antibiotics can cause side effects in some people. The most common one is diarrhoea.
But it's important to keep taking the antibiotics, even if this happens.

If your treatment causes diarrhoea that doesn't stop after a few days, talk to your
doctor.

What will happen to me?
Treatment to remove the cause of ulcers, and then to help them heal, usually works
well.

If you need to take NSAIDs for a long-term condition your doctor will prescribe a
proton pump inhibitor to take as well, to help protect your stomach. But ulcers can
come back in people who take NSAIDs.

If you tested positive for H. pylori your doctor should arrange for you to have an endoscopy 4 weeks after the end of
your treatment, to check that your ulcer has healed.

If you are a smoker your doctor will advise you to stop, as smoking can irritate the
lining of the stomach."

If you think you might have an infection in your lower abdomen it's important to see
your doctor straight away. Delaying treatment can lead to long-term pain and damage
your reproductive organs, making it hard for you to have a baby in the future.

What is pelvic inflammatory disease?
Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID for short) means you have an infection in your reproductive
organs that has caused inflammation (swelling). These organs include your womb (uterus),
your ovaries, and your fallopian tubes.

PID is almost always caused by an infection that is spread by having sex (a sexually
transmitted infection or STI for short). The infection starts in your vagina or your
cervix and spreads to the rest of your reproductive organs.

The fallopian tubes carry eggs from your ovaries to your womb. If these tubes get
inflamed, scar tissue may form and block them. This makes it hard to get pregnant.

And if you do get pregnant the baby might start growing part of the way along your
fallopian tube instead of in your womb. This is called an ectopic pregnancy and it
can be dangerous.

PID is often caused by the same bacteria that cause gonorrhoea or chlamydia, but it
can be caused by many types of bacteria.

Any sexually active woman can get PID. It's most common in women younger than 25.
Other things that make you more likely to get PID are having had a sexually transmitted
infection before, and having an intrauterine contraceptive device (an IUD or 'coil')
put in.

Your chances of getting PID (or any other sexually transmitted infection) also increase
the more sexual partners you have.

What are the symptoms?
It's not always easy to tell if you have PID. The symptoms are sometimes very mild.
But if you do notice symptoms it's important to see a doctor.

Symptoms can include:


Pain in the lower part of your abdomen (tummy)


Pain during sex


Bleeding between your periods or after sex


Discharge from your vagina, which may smell bad


A fever


Pain in your lower back


Feeling sick


Needing to pass urine often and find passing urine painful


Having more pain than usual during your period or in the middle of your menstrual
cycle



Your periods stopping completely.


Your doctor will check you for a high temperature (fever is a common sign of infection)
and examine your abdomen and the inside of your vagina. Your doctor may also take
a blood sample and a swab from your cervix, to check for infection.

But if your doctor suspects that you have PID, he or she will probably start treatment
straight away, before getting the results of these tests. This is because delaying
treatment could damage your fertility.

What treatments work?
PID is treated with antibiotics. You probably won't need any other treatment. But
you may still have long-term problems if your fallopian tubes were damaged before
you started the treatment.

Treatment for mild to moderate PID
You will probably start with an injection of antibiotics followed by a course of tablets.
It's important that you take the tablets exactly as your doctor advises. For example,
don't just stop taking them if you start to feel better. Finish the whole course unless
your doctor tells you otherwise.

Most women don't need to be treated in hospital and can carry on with their lives
as normal while the antibiotics work. But your doctor might suggest that you try to
get as much rest as you can for a week or two.

Common side effects of antibiotics are feeling sick and diarrhoea. But these are usually
mild.

As well as prescribing antibiotics your doctor might suggest that you take medicines
for any pain you might be having. This might just be painkillers that you can buy
over the counter, like paracetamol or ibuprofen.

Your doctor should see you again one or two days after you start taking your antibiotics.
You should have started to improve by then. If you haven't begun to feel better your
doctor might want to do more tests, or he or she might advise you that you need treatment
in hospital.

Treatment for more severe PID
Some women with PID need to be treated in hospital, usually with intravenous (IV)
antibiotics. Your doctor might suggest that you need hospital treatment if:



Your symptoms are severe: for example, you have a high fever and are vomiting


You have not improved after taking antibiotics for a few days


Your doctor thinks that your symptoms might be caused by something other than PID,
such as appendicitis, for which you might need surgery



For some reason you can't take your antibiotic tablets


You are pregnant.


Some women need to have a procedure called a laparoscopy to help find out what is
causing their symptoms. This involves a surgeon making a small cut in your abdomen
that a tiny camera can pass through. The surgeon can then see inside the abdomen and
hopefully discover the cause of the problem.

Things you can do for yourself
The best way to protect yourself against PID is to avoid the sexually transmitted
infections (STIs) that cause it. You should:



Avoid having multiple current sexual partners


Use condoms correctly every time you have sex


Not have sex under the influence of alcohol, money, or drugs.


If you have done any of these things, or if you have a new partner, or if you are
younger than 25 years old (even if you haven't taken any of these risks), then you
should be regularly tested for STIs.

If you have PID it's important that your sexual partner gets checked for infection.
Even if your partner has no symptoms they might still have gonorrhoea or chlamydia.

This means that your partner will need to be treated to avoid passing the infection
back to you. You will need to avoid having sex until you and your partner have both
finished taking the antibiotics.

Some couples choose to be tested for chlamydia when starting a relationship. Women
who have PID should also be offered HIV testing.

What will happen to me?
About 9 out of 10 women are cured of PID by taking antibiotics, either at home or
in hospital.

If you use a contraceptive coil (IUD), you might need to have it removed.
Unfortunately, treatment for PID won't undo any damage that the infection has already
done to your reproductive organs.

PID can happen again if you get a new infection. So it's best to do everything that
you reasonably can to avoid sexually transmitted infections."

If you or someone close to you has got Parkinson's, you may be worried about what
it will mean for the future. But your symptoms may not bother you very much for several
years. When they do, there are treatments that can help delay the worst effects.

What treatments are available?
Parkinson's affects how you are able to move. An early sign is often a slight trembling
in one hand. Over time you start doing things more and more slowly as your muscles
become stiff. You may lose your balance more easily.

Parkinson's happens when your brain stops making enough of a chemical called dopamine. Brain cells need dopamine to send messages around the brain, and to nerves and muscles
throughout your body.

There's no cure for Parkinson's, but medicines can help control your symptoms. Exercise, physiotherapy, and other types of therapy can also help you cope with your symptoms. If your Parkinson's
is more advanced a type of surgery called deep brain stimulation may be an option.

Medicines
You may have heard of a drug called levodopa that's often used to treat Parkinson's. It can be really helpful for people with
Parkinson's, but it can cause unpleasant side effects, which can sometimes be severe.

So doctors don't tend to prescribe it if your symptoms are mild. Once your symptoms
become more severe, levodopa is the most effective treatment for Parkinson's.

Other medicines that can help with Parkinson's include:


monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) inhibitors. These drugs can help you move more easily and reduce stiffness and shaking



dopamine agonists. Dopamine agonists work in a similar way to dopamine in the brain, which can help
reduce the symptoms of Parkinson's



amantadine is a medicine that was originally developed to treat flu but was later found to help
relieve Parkinson's symptoms



anticholinergic drugs can help control the physical symptoms of Parkinson's, such as shaking and jerking.



These medicines are sometimes used together, or combined with levodopa and another
drug called carbidopa, which helps levodopa to work better.

You take most medicines for Parkinson's as tablets and capsules, although some come
as skin patches, injections, and soluble tablets.

All Parkinson's medicines can cause side effects. Your doctor should discuss these with you in detail. Your doctor may also be able
to prescribe medicines that help control these side effects.

Levodopa
Most people treated for Parkinson's take levodopa at some point. This treatment can work so well that your symptoms may clear up for
a while.

Levodopa is changed into dopamine in your body. This replaces the dopamine in your
brain that is lost if you have Parkinson's.

However, levodopa can cause side effects. Nausea, vomiting, and sleep problems are the most common. Also, after taking levodopa
for several years it can stop working so well, with your symptoms coming back between
doses.

Most people also get more serious side effects after about five years of taking levodopa.
The main problem is abnormal movements that you can't control, such as head nodding,
jerking, and twitches. These are called dyskinesias.

Exercise and other types of therapy
Research has found that regular exercise can be helpful for people with any stage of Parkinson's, improving their movements
and what they can do physically. Strengthening exercises that use gradually increasing
weights seem to be especially helpful.

You may hear this called progressive resistance exercise. Other types of exercise, such as Tai Chi and dance, have also been found to be safe
and helpful for people with Parkinson's.

You may also benefit from working with therapists who are trained to treat people
with Parkinson's.



A physiotherapist can advise you about exercises to help you move more easily.



An occupational therapist can help you to carry on doing things that become harder because of Parkinson's.
For example, you may get advice on how to cope around the house or how to continue
taking part in leisure activities that you enjoy.



A speech and language therapist can help if you have problems with your voice, speaking, or swallowing. These problems
are more likely in advanced Parkinson's.



Deep brain stimulation
A type of surgery called deep brain stimulation may be an option if you have had Parkinson's
for a long time and are no longer helped enough by drug treatments.

It can ease some of your symptoms, especially stiff muscles, shaking, and movements
you can't control. But how long the benefits of surgery will last varies from person
to person. It may be a year or two, or it could be much longer.

Deep brain stimulation involves having a device fitted in your chest. Wires from the
device are fixed into a part of your brain affected by Parkinson's. Electrical pulses
from the device stimulate this part of the brain to reduce your symptoms.

You can talk to your doctor about whether surgery would be a good option for you.
But it's important to remember that surgery cannot cure Parkinson's. And it won't
stop your symptoms progressing. You'll probably need to keep taking drugs for Parkinson's
after surgery.

What to expect in the future
No one can say for sure what will happen to you if you've got Parkinson's. Everyone
is different, and the way the condition affects you may be different from the way
it affects someone else.

Some people hardly notice their symptoms in the early stages of Parkinson's and lead
a full life for many years. But symptoms usually get worse as time goes by and the
brain makes less and less dopamine.

Some people also get other problems related to their Parkinson's, such as depression,
fatigue, sleep problems, constipation, and reduced mental ability. Be sure to discuss
any problems with your doctor, as there may be treatments that can help.

It's important to stay positive if you can. Take regular exercise and carry on doing
the things you enjoy. You may also want to join a support group for people with Parkinson's.
All these things can help you cope with your condition.

If you're caring for someone with Parkinson's, you may need support, too. If you feel
you can't cope or you become depressed, your doctor or another health professional
may be able to put you in touch with local support groups and organisations that offer
help."

It can come as a surprise to find out that you or someone close to you has Parkinson's.
You may be worried about what it will mean for the future. But your symptoms may not
bother you very much for several years. When they do, there are treatments that can
help.

What happens in Parkinson's?
Parkinson's affects how you are able to move. An early sign is often a slight trembling
in one hand. Over time you start doing things more and more slowly as your muscles
become stiff. You may lose your balance more easily.

Parkinson's happens when your brain stops making enough of a chemical called dopamine. Brain cells need dopamine to send messages around the brain, and to nerves and muscles
throughout your body.

For example, dopamine helps to stop you tripping at the kerb as you step into a road.
And it helps you move your fingers to tie your shoelaces. With less dopamine you can't
control your movements in the usual way.

Doctors don't know why some people stop making enough dopamine. The genes you have
inherited from your parents may play a role, as well as things that happen during
your life ('environmental factors'). But we do know that the chance of getting Parkinson's
increases as you get older.

What are the symptoms?
Parkinson's can affect you in four main ways:


Shaking (doctors call this tremor): Your hand may shake, especially when you're either relaxing
or feeling stressed. Many people rub their thumb and index finger together as if rolling
a pill. Shaking can also affect your neck, chin, and head.



Stiff muscles (rigidity): You might find it difficult to move. For example, you might find it difficult
to get out of a chair. Your face might seem less expressive because the muscles there
aren't moving as well as they normally would.



Slow movements (bradykinesia or akinesia): You might find it hard to start moving and you might
stay in the same position for longer than you usually would. But your ability to move
might come and go, so that you can be moving easily one minute and then suddenly need
help.

Tasks that you once did quickly and easily, such as washing and dressing, might take
much longer to do. Your handwriting might look spidery and small.



Poor balance (postural instability): You might lean forward or backward and fall over easily,
and you might have problems walking. You might freeze in mid-stride and not be able
to take the next step. (Doctors call this freezing of gait, or FOG for short.) You
might take quick, small, shuffling steps.



Parkinson's affects everyone differently. You probably won't get all of these symptoms.
And at first your symptoms will probably be mild. They tend to progress slowly and
in no particular order.

There are no special tests for Parkinson's. Your doctor will usually make a diagnosis
after talking to you about your symptoms and doing a physical examination. Some people
might have blood tests or a brain scan, usually to rule out other conditions.

It's important to keep track of your symptoms so that you can tell your doctor how
they have changed since your last visit. You might want to keep a diary of your symptoms to show your doctor. This information will help your doctor decide when you should
start treatment and when you need to change your treatment.

If your symptoms are mild and don't bother you very much it might be many years before
you need any treatment for Parkinson's.

What will happen to me?
No one can say for sure what will happen to you if you have Parkinson's. The way the
disease affects you might be very different from the way it affects someone else.

Some people hardly notice their symptoms in the early stages of Parkinson's and lead
a full life for many years. But symptoms usually get worse as time goes by and the
brain makes less and less dopamine.

Everyone is different. But a typical pattern for many people with Parkinson's goes
something like this:



most people find that treatment makes a big difference for several years. Their symptoms
might go away completely



after about five years, the treatment stops working as well, and symptoms get worse


the next stage is that symptoms such as freezing, falling, and dementia, might get
a lot worse. This can happen within a few more years, or it can take many years.



Some people get other problems related to their Parkinson's, such as:


depression


fatigue


sleep problems


constipation, and


reduced mental ability.


Be sure to discuss any problems with your doctor, as there might be treatments that
can help.

It's important to stay positive if you can. Take regular exercise and carry on doing the things you enjoy. You might also want to join a support group for people with Parkinson's. All these things can help you cope with your condition.


If you're caring for someone with Parkinson's, you might need support, too. If you
feel you can't cope or you become depressed, your doctor or another health professional
might be able to put you in touch with local support groups and organisations that
offer assistance."

Being diagnosed with a serious illness like Parkinson's often comes as a shock. You
may find it hard to think of everything you want to ask your doctor.

It might help to make a list of questions before your appointment. You could also
take notes during your visit, or bring a close friend or relative with you to ask
questions and jot down information.

Here are some questions you may want to ask.


Have I definitely got Parkinson's? Or could my symptoms be caused by something else?


I'd like to see a specialist. Can you recommend a doctor who specialises in Parkinson's?




Will my symptoms get worse?

Could speech therapy help me?


Do other people in my family have an increased chance of getting Parkinson's?


Can you recommend any online or local support groups?"
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1487843271809/Paracetamol%20overdose,Paracetamol overdose,"Paracetamol overdose Last published: Jul 06, 2020
Most people recover completely from a paracetamol overdose, but it can cause lasting
liver damage or be fatal. If you think that you or someone else have taken too much
paracetamol, talk to a doctor straight away. If you think someone has taken a very
large amount, call an ambulance.

What is paracetamol overdose?
Paracetamol is a medicine used to treat pain and fever. It is widely available without
prescription.

The recommended dose for an adult is no more than 4 grams (4 g or 4000 milligrams
[mg]) in a 24-hour period. Any amount more than this is considered to be an overdose.
The dosing for children is much lower and depends on the child’s age.

Too much paracetamol can cause liver damage. If someone takes enough paracetamol to
cause liver failure, this can be fatal.

Accidental overdose
A paracetamol overdose can happen if someone takes too much of it without meaning
to: for example, they might misread the instructions on the packaging.

But an overdose can happen even when people take the correct dose: for example, if
they then take a second medication, such as a cold-and-flu remedy, without realising
that it contains paracetamol.

Accidental overdoses in children can also happen if parents and carers don’t use the
special measuring spoons or cups that come with the medicine, or if they don’t use
them correctly.

Deliberate overdose
Some people take a paracetamol overdose on purpose, as a suicide attempt. Paracetamol
overdose is a common method of attempted suicide in many countries.

What are the symptoms?
A paracetamol overdose often doesn’t cause any noticeable symptoms in the first 24
hours. But symptoms that may occur in the first 24 hours after an overdose can include:




Loss of appetite


Nausea (feeling sick)


Vomiting


Pain in the abdomen (tummy).


Signs of liver damage generally develop two or three days after an overdose. These
can include:



Pain and tenderness on the right side of the chest


Nausea


Vomiting


Yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes (jaundice).


What treatments work?
If you are treated for a paracetamol overdose the medical staff will ask you a lot
of questions. The information you give them will help them to give you the best possible
treatment. The medical staff will ask you:



Exactly, or as near as you can remember, when you (or your child) took the paracetamol




How much paracetamol you think you or your child took


Whether you took paracetamol with alcohol, and how much alcohol you drank. Drinking
a lot of alcohol with paracetamol can increase the damage the drug does to your liver




What other medicines or recreational drugs you may have taken, and exactly when you
took them.



Many people who have taken too much paracetamol will recover completely with just
careful monitoring in hospital. This means that medical staff will regularly check
how much paracetamol is in your system, to make sure it is falling to a safe level
quickly enough. They may also do other tests to check whether your liver has been
damaged.

Drug treatment
A drug called acetylcysteine is used when doctors think that your liver will not recover
enough on its own.

Acetylcysteine is highly effective in preventing and reducing liver damage, even in
people who have taken large overdoses. But it works best when given as soon as possible
after an overdose.

Acetylcysteine can be given as tablets, but it is often given as an intravenous (IV)
drip, as it can cause nausea and vomiting in some people. It can also cause other
side effects, including a rash, itching, breathing problems, and, very rarely, death.
So doctors tend to only use it if they think you really need it.

Some doctors also give charcoal tablets to some people after a paracetamol overdose.
The idea is that charcoal attracts toxic substances to itself in the digestive system.
These substances can then pass harmlessly out of the body when you go to the toilet.


Preventing another overdose
If you have accidentally taken too much paracetamol or given too much to your child,
a doctor or nurse should talk to you about how to prevent this happening again.

These are some of the things they might discuss with you:
Don’t take (or give) more than the recommended dose
If you are in a lot of pain, or if your child is suffering with pain or a fever, it
can be tempting to use more paracetamol than is recommended. But this can be dangerous.

If your symptoms are so bad that basic pain medications like paracetamol don’t work,
see your doctor. There may be medications that will suit you better. Or your doctor
may be able to help you find out why your pain is so bad. Don’t just keep taking more
pain medications without talking to your doctor.

Look carefully at the dosing advice on the packaging. It should advise you how and
when to take the medicine. For example, the recommended adult dose in any 24-hour
period is 4000 mg.

But this doesn’t mean that you take it all at once. The instructions on the packaging
should explain that, if you need to take paracetamol over a 24-hour period, you take
a little at a time. For an adult this usually means two 500 mg tablets every 6 to
8 hours.

Be aware of other medicines that contain paracetamol
It’s easy to take too much paracetamol if you don’t know which other medicines contain
it, too. Many common prescription and over-the-counter medications can contain paracetamol.
Examples of these include:



Medicines for sinus pain


Cold-and-flu remedies


Cough medicines


Other pain medications, such as combinations of codeine and paracetamol (sometimes
called co-codamol)



Teething medicines for children.


Carefully read the ingredients and instructions on any medication you take alongside
paracetamol. If you are in any doubt about dosing, seek help from a pharmacist. If
you have already taken the recommended dose of paracetamol, taking another medicine
that contains paracetamol could be dangerous.

There are different doses for adults and children, and for children of different ages


Liquid paracetamol for children can come in different strengths for different ages.
For example, in many countries there is one version for children aged up to 5 years,
and one version for children aged 6 years and over.

And each version will have detailed dosing instructions on the packaging depending
on your child’s age, and possibly on their weight. So, for example, the recommended
dose of liquid paracetamol for a child of 12 months will be different than for a child
aged 2 to 4 years old, and so on. And a child who is small for his or her age might
need less than a larger child.

For children, use the spoon, cup, or syringe provided
Liquid paracetamol medicines for children should come with a special-sized spoon or
measuring cup that helps you give them exactly the right dose for their age. Some
versions come with a plastic syringe that helps you drip the medicine into your child’s
mouth if they have trouble taking it from a spoon.

It’s important to use these measures correctly. To avoid losing them, try keeping
them in a special compartment in a drawer, or in a bag with the medicine bottle.

If you don’t understand the recommended dosing, ask for help
Instructions on packages and bottles can be confusing, especially if you are in pain
or feeling unwell. If possible, ask someone to help you make sure you’re not taking
too much.

What will happen?
About 10 in 100 people will have some lasting liver damage after a paracetamol overdose.
Some people need to have a liver transplant. One or 2 in every 100 people will die
from liver failure.

But most people recover all their liver function, usually in between one and three
weeks.

If you took a deliberate overdose, it is likely to have been the result of depression,
stress, or similar problems. So it’s important that you get the support you need with
your mental health. Your doctor should arrange an appointment with a mental health
professional as soon as possible so that you can start having the therapy that is
most helpful for you."

If you've ever had a panic attack you'll know how frightening it is. But, no matter
how alarming your feelings are, it's important to know that nothing will happen to
you. The feelings usually fade away after a few minutes.

Some people never have a second panic attack, while others find that they happen again.
If this happens to you there are treatments that can help you cope.

You can use our information to talk to your doctor and decide which treatments are
right for you.

What treatments work?
If you have a panic attack you suddenly feel terrified, possibly for no reason. You
may even feel as though the world is going to end or that you're going to die. Your
heart may pound and you may feel sweaty or find it hard to catch your breath. You
may also feel dizzy and start to tremble.

Doctors aren't certain why some people get panic attacks. People who get panic attacks
tend to start getting them in their late teens or early 20s. Women get them more often
than men.

If you have just started having panic attacks, and especially if you have only had
one panic attack, you may not need any treatment.

Your doctor should reassure you that panic attacks are common (they affect about one-third
of people at some point in their lives), they are not dangerous, and they might never
happen to you again.

Your doctor might also suggest you try self-help techniques to help you cope with feelings of panic: for example, through books or online resources.

Research suggests that many people who try self-help techniques for panic attacks
find that they help a lot.

Learning as much as you can about panic attacks and what doctors call panic disorder can also be a huge help. For example, many people feel less anxious and more in control
once they understand that while panic attacks can be really scary, they are not dangerous
in themselves.

But if you feel you would like more help there are treatments available.
The main treatments for panic disorder are:


talking treatments (psychotherapy)


medicines, and


a combination of psychotherapy and medicines.


Talking treatments
A talking treatment called cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) can help you feel better
and cope with situations that make you panic.

CBT can also be helpful for people who have a condition where they are afraid of certain
situations or places (agoraphobia). But CBT can take a while to start working.

When you have CBT you usually see a therapist for about 50 minutes once a week. CBT
can last from several weeks to up to six months. You and your therapist will work
together to:



look at what brings on a panic attack


understand what happens to your body to cause your symptoms, and


help you cope with anxious feelings or thoughts.


You might be given homework to do between sessions.
CBT can work well for people who have other conditions alongside panic attacks: for
example, depression or anxiety. If you have one of these problems as well as panic
attacks you might be referred to a psychiatrist for extra help.

Medicines
The medicines most commonly offered to people who have panic attacks or panic disorder
are antidepressants.

As the name suggests, these medicines are usually used to treat depression. But these
medicines can help prevent panic attacks in many people.

There are many types of antidepressant. If you decide you would like to try this treatment
you can talk with your doctor about which one might suit you.

Some people get side effects from antidepressants, such as dry mouth, dizziness, stomach
upsets, or problems sleeping. If side effects bother you you could try switching to
a different drug.

Some antidepressants can occasionally cause more serious side effects. Your doctor
should discuss these with you and tell you what to look out for.

Some antidepressants can cause withdrawal symptoms if you stop taking them suddenly
or if your dose is reduced. Talk to your doctor first if you decide you want to stop
taking antidepressants.

Some people might be offered medicines called benzodiazepines to help reduce panic
attacks. But these medicines are usually only offered to people with severe symptoms,
as for most people they don't seem to work as well as other treatments.

Benzodiazepines can also cause serious side effects and people may become dependent
on them. In some countries benzodiazepines are no longer used to treat panic attacks.
For example, they are rarely, if ever, used in the UK.

What happens during a panic attack?
If you have a panic attack you suddenly feel terrified, possibly for no reason. Along
with other symptoms, such as a pounding heart, you might even feel as though the world
is going to end or that you're going to die.

Doctors aren't certain why some people get panic attacks. People who get panic attacks
tend to start getting them in their late teens or early 20s. Women get them more often
than men.

If the fear of having a panic attack is stopping you from living life normally you
may have what doctors call panic disorder.

Doctors diagnose panic disorder if someone has been having panic attacks, and worrying
about having more attacks, for at least one month.

What are the symptoms?
Panic attacks can happen unexpectedly, or when you feel anxious about a situation.
Your doctor might say you have had a panic attack if you have had at least four of
these symptoms:



A racing, pounding, or skipping heart beat


Sweating


Shortness of breath or a smothering feeling


A feeling of choking


Chest pain or discomfort


Nausea or discomfort in your stomach


Feeling dizzy, light headed, unsteady, or faint


Feeling detached from yourself


Fear of losing control or going crazy


Numbness or tingling feelings


Chills or hot flushes


Trembling or shaking.


What will happen to me?
It's hard to say exactly what will happen to you. Different people experience panic
disorder in different ways. And a treatment that helps you may not help someone else.

Many people who get panic attacks find that their symptoms come and go. About half
of people who have treatment don't get panic attacks again, but some people still
get some symptoms. For a few people, treatment doesn't seem to help.

If you have agoraphobia (an extreme fear of certain situations or places), anxiety,
or depression as well as panic disorder, it may be harder for you to make a good recovery.

But if you have panic disorder without one of these other conditions your chances
of recovering completely are very good.

https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1486568316753/Pancreatitis%2C%20acute,"Pancreatitis, acute","Pancreatitis, acute Last published: Aug 05, 2021
Pancreatitis can cause severe pain in your abdomen that extends to your back.
This information looks at pancreatitis that comes on quickly, called acute pancreatitis.
Acute pancreatitis can be life threatening, but most people recover fully with treatment.


What is acute pancreatitis?
If you have acute pancreatitis, your pancreas is inflamed (swollen). Your pancreas
is a long, flat gland that lies just behind your stomach. It has two main jobs:



It makes enzymes that help you break down (digest) the food you eat.


It makes hormones that help you use the energy you get from food.


The two most common causes of pancreatitis are gallstones and drinking a lot of alcohol.




Gallstones are small stones that can form in your gallbladder. If they block your bile duct,
this can stop digestive enzymes from leaving your pancreas.

It can also cause bile to flow into your pancreas. These things can lead to pancreatitis.




Drinking a lot of alcohol over several years can also lead to pancreatitis. Binge drinking (drinking a lot
in a short amount of time) increases your chance of getting pancreatitis even more.




Other things that can sometimes cause pancreatitis include:


taking certain medicines


having some types of infections, and


having high levels of fats called triglycerides in your blood.


But sometimes doctors can’t find any specific cause for the condition.
What are the symptoms?
The main symptom of acute pancreatitis is severe pain in your upper abdomen (between
your tummy and chest).

The pain usually comes on quickly, and may extend to your back. It will probably feel
worse when you move or when you press on your abdomen.

Other common symptoms include:


feeling sick or being sick


losing your appetite


having a fast pulse


having a fever.


The symptoms of acute pancreatitis are similar to those of many other conditions,
so your doctor won’t be able to tell if you have pancreatitis based on your symptoms
alone.

You will need tests, both to confirm that you have pancreatitis and to find out what
might be causing it. These tests may include blood tests as well as scans, such as
an ultrasound scan or chest x-ray.

What treatments work?
Treatments for pancreatitis are aimed at relieving your symptoms and helping your
pancreas to recover. These treatments are given in hospital. They usually include:




Having fluids by an intravenous (IV) drip. You will have fluids put directly into your bloodstream through a vein in your arm.

This replaces fluids you may have lost (for example, if you have been vomiting), and
keeps you hydrated. This will help your pancreas to heal and prevents other problems,
such as kidney damage.



Oxygen. Pancreatitis can reduce the amount of oxygen in your blood. Some people need to
be given extra oxygen, usually twice a day for the first few days.



Making sure you get enough nutrition. You might not feel like eating for a few days. But you should start to eat again
as soon as you are able to. You will probably start eating small, low-fat meals of
carbohydrates and proteins, and then gradually increase your portion size.

But if your pancreatitis is severe or you don’t improve enough after a couple of days
of not eating, your doctor may recommend that you have a temporary feeding tube inserted
to make sure you get enough nutrition.



Medicines to help with pain. Doctors often use strong pain medicines called opioids to help with the pain of
pancreatitis. Examples include fentanyl and morphine. You will have these through
an IV drip.



Medicines to prevent vomiting. These medicines are called anti-emetics. They can help you stop feeling sick and
being sick. They are usually given through an IV drip.



Depending on how severe your pancreatitis is and what problems it is causing, you
may need other treatments, such as extra magnesium.

Once your pancreatitis is under control, you may need treatment to address what caused
your pancreas to become inflamed. For example, your doctor may recommend:



Treatment for gallstones. If your pancreatitis was caused by gallstones, your doctor will probably recommend
having surgery to remove your gallbladder and clear any blockages.

There are a couple of ways to do this. You can have keyhole surgery (also called laparoscopic
surgery), where the surgeon makes several small cuts and uses a tiny camera and tools
to take out your gallbladder. Or you may need open surgery, where the surgeon makes a larger cut to see directly into your abdomen.

If you are unable to have surgery for any reason, your doctor may recommend having
a treatment called endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).

This is done with a device called an endoscope. It is put into your mouth and threaded
down into your gallbladder to remove gallstones and relieve any blockages.



Treatment to help you stop drinking. If heavy drinking caused your pancreatitis, your doctor may recommend entering a
treatment programme for alcohol dependence.

If you don’t stop drinking, your pancreatitis may return and cause other serious health
problems.



What will happen?
Most people treated for acute pancreatitis feel better within a week and make a full
recovery.

But it is important to get treatment as soon as possible, as pancreatitis can lead
to a wide range of serious health problems, including lung injury and kidney failure.
These problems can be life threatening.

It’s also important to treat the underlying cause of your pancreatitis, to reduce
the chance of it happening again. Repeated bouts of acute pancreatitis can damage
your pancreas and lead to long-term (chronic) pancreatitis.

If you have any questions or concerns, be sure to discuss these with your doctor."

Pancreatic cancer is a serious illness. If you've been told you have this cancer,
you'll probably feel anxious about what lies ahead.

If the cancer is diagnosed at an early stage, surgery to remove the cancer can help
you live longer. If your cancer is more advanced, this type of cancer is much harder
to treat.

What is pancreatic cancer?
Your pancreas lies just behind your stomach. It's a gland that helps you break down
the food you eat. It also helps you use the energy you get from food.

Usually, cells in your body grow and die in an orderly way. But if you have pancreatic
cancer, some of the cells start to grow out of control. They form a lump called a
tumour.

Cells from the tumour can break off, travel around your body, and cause cancers in
other locations (called metastases).

We don't know why some people get pancreatic cancer and others don't. But it is more
common in older people, people who smoke, and those with family members who have had
this cancer.

What are the symptoms?
In the early stages, pancreatic cancer usually doesn't cause any problems, although
some people get vague symptoms, such as a feeling generally unwell (called malaise) or weight loss.

Most people first get symptoms when their cancer grows and spreads. For example, if
the tumour blocks the flow of bile from your liver, you might get:



yellow skin (jaundice)


dark urine


pale stools, and


itching.


As the tumour grows, you might:


have pain in your back or abdomen


feel very tired


lose your appetite, and


lose weight.


If the tumour blocks the tube from your stomach to your bowels, you may feel sick
and vomit.

These symptoms can be caused by other illnesses that are less serious than pancreatic
cancer. But it's important not to ignore them The sooner your doctor checks them out,
the more quickly you can get treatment for whatever is causing them.

Pancreatic cancer can be difficult to diagnose. The first doctor you see is likely
to be your usual doctor. If your doctor thinks that your symptoms could be due to
pancreatic cancer, you'll be referred to specialist doctors for tests to be certain.


The doctors will find out whether you have pancreatic cancer based on:


your symptoms


a physical examination


blood tests, and


scans to look at your internal organs.


They may also need to take a sample of cells from your pancreas (a biopsy) to be tested for cancer cells.

If doctors are fairly sure from other tests that you have pancreatic cancer and they
want to operate to remove it, you may not need a biopsy. Your doctors will look at
the tumour and test it for cancer during the operation.

What treatments work?
Your treatment will depend on the stage of your pancreatic cancer. The stage of cancer describes how far the cancer has spread.



Early stage cancers have not spread outside the pancreas, or have not spread very far.



Later stage cancers have spread to other parts of your body.



Surgery to remove your cancer
If you have early stage pancreatic cancer, you may be able to have surgery to remove
part, or all, of your pancreas.

There are different ways of doing the operation depending on where in your pancreas
the cancer is.

The most common operation is to remove the part of the pancreas called the head. The surgeon will also remove parts of other organs nearby, such as your duodenum
(the first part of your small bowel).

Your doctor will be able to tell you if your cancer is suitable for surgery and how
this is likely to help you.

Unfortunately, surgery will not work for everyone who is diagnosed with early stage
cancer. Some cancer cells may have already gone into your bloodstream before your
surgery, but have not shown up in tests.

These cells may have travelled around your body and caused cancers in other locations.
Surgery on the pancreas cannot get rid of these cancers.

Surgery to remove pancreatic cancer is a major operation. You'll need a general anaesthetic to keep you asleep during surgery. And you're likely to need a couple of weeks in
hospital to recover.

Problems (complications) can happen during or after your operation. For example, it's possible for digestive
juices from the pancreas to leak into your body.

Other possible problems include:


bleeding


an infection, and


inflammation (swelling).


Complications may be less likely if you have surgery in a specialist centre that does
a lot of operations for pancreatic cancer.

Chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and chemoradiotherapy
These treatments are occasionally used before surgery to shrink the cancer so it is
easier to remove. More commonly, they are used after surgery to help kill any cancer
cells that were left behind by the operation.

These treatments are also often offered to people with more advanced cancer who aren't
able to have surgery.

Chemotherapy uses medicines to kill cancer cells. You'll probably be given these medicines directly
into your bloodstream through a tube inserted into a vein (an intravenous infusion).

Radiotherapy kills cancer cells by directing high-energy x-rays into parts of your body where
there may be cancer. When these treatments are combined, it is called chemoradiotherapy.

By killing cancer cells and slowing down the growth of the cancer, these treatments
can help people live longer. They can also help improve the symptoms caused by the
cancer.

All of these treatments can cause side effects, which some people find difficult to cope with. You and your doctors will discuss
the possible benefits and risks of treatment so you can decide what approach is right
for you.

Other treatments to help with symptoms
Surgery to remove your cancer, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy can all help to improve
your symptoms. Your doctor may recommend the following treatments as well.

Medicines to help with pain
People with pancreatic cancer sometimes get pain in their abdomen, in their back,
or both.

If you have pain, be sure to discuss this with your doctors. There is a range of pain
medicines that can help, from non-prescription options to stronger prescription medicines.

If one medicine doesn't help enough, your doctor can recommend other options.
Medicines to help with digestion
Your pancreas helps you digest food, but it may not be able to do its job very well
if you have pancreatic cancer, or if you've had surgery on your pancreas to remove
your cancer.

To help, doctors recommend taking pancreatic enzyme supplements.

These medicines can improve your digestion and help you maintain your weight. Your
doctors will also monitor your diet and may recommend other supplements.

Treatments to help with blockages
Some common symptoms of pancreatic cancer are caused by the cancer blocking the common
bile duct. This stops bile flowing from your liver to your small bowel.

If this happens it can cause:


jaundice


itching


nausea, and


an uncomfortable feeling in your bowels.


If you are able to have surgery to remove your cancer, this should remove the blockage.
But if you can't have this surgery, or can't have it right away, your doctors may
instead recommend having a small tube (called a stent) fitted inside the duct to open it up.

Another way doctors can relieve the blockage to the bile duct is to cut the duct just
above the blockage and rejoin the duct to your small bowel.

After your operation, bile will bypass all or part of your bile duct and drain into
your bowel. This is called a biliary bypass.

Taking part in clinical trials
Doctors are still learning what treatments work best for pancreatic cancer. There
are many studies under way testing new treatments.

The only way you can normally get one of these treatments is to take part in a clinical trial. Your doctor will be able to tell you if there are trials going on in your area that
might be suitable for you.

But bear in mind that you may not get the new treatment when you take part in a clinical
trial. Studies usually compare a new treatment with a standard treatment. Nobody knows
before the study which treatment they will get or whether one might work better than
the other.

What will happen to me?
It’s not possible to say exactly what will happen to you, because pancreatic cancer
affects everyone differently. There are striking success stories, and some people
live for many years.

But most people diagnosed with pancreatic cancer do not. In about half of people diagnosed
with pancreatic cancer, it has already spread too far for surgery to work. These people
generally don't live longer than about six months.

And even those who can have surgery to remove the cancer don't usually live for more
than a few years.

Treatments other than surgery won’t cure your cancer, but they can help shrink your
tumour, slow down the progression of your cancer, and improve your symptoms.

Where to get more help
There are many charities and support groups for people with pancreatic cancer and
their families. In the UK, for example, Pancreatic Cancer UK (pancreaticcancer.org.uk)
provides information about pancreatic cancer, including details on the latest research,
as well as support for patients and carers.

You can ask your doctors and nurses what resources are available in your area."

Painful periods can make you feel miserable and stop you fully enjoying life. But
there are treatments that can help you feel better, including things you can do besides
taking medicines.

You can use our information to talk to your doctor or pharmacist and decide which
treatments are right for you.

What causes painful periods?
Many women get pain in their lower abdomen (pelvis) during their period.
Research suggests that the pain is usually caused by the body making large quantities
of chemicals called prostaglandins.

Prostaglandins help the womb to squeeze (contract) to shed its lining each month,
resulting in the flow of blood during a woman's period.

Women who have higher amounts of prostaglandins tend to have worse period pain.
Although period pain is not usually a sign of an underlying problem, it can sometimes
be caused by a medical condition. For example, period pain can be caused by:



endometriosis (when bits of womb lining grow in your lower abdomen), and by


pelvic inflammatory disease, or PID for short (when an infection in your reproductive
organs has caused inflammation).



Your doctor may do tests to check for these and other conditions. If your period pain
starts when you're in your 30s or 40s, it's more likely to be caused by a medical
condition.

Here, however, we focus on period pain that is not caused by a medical condition.
What are the symptoms?
The most common symptom is sharp spasms (cramps), usually in the middle of the lower
abdomen. You may also get:



pain in your lower back and down the backs of your legs


nausea and vomiting


headaches and light-headedness.


For most women, period pain comes on when their bleeding starts, or a few hours before.
It is usually worst during the heaviest days of their period.

This type of period pain is most common in younger women. It often starts 6 to 12
months after a young woman has had her first period.

You should talk to your doctor if you get any of the following symptoms, as it may
suggest you have an underlying medical condition causing your pain:



Pain at other times (not just in the first few days of your period)


Pain during sex


Bleeding after sex


A discharge from your vagina that is different from normal.


What treatments work?
Medicines
Painkillers can help with painful periods. Medicines called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs) seem to work best for period pain.

Ibuprofen is an NSAID that you can buy over the counter from a pharmacy. But for some
NSAIDs (such as mefenamic acid and naproxen), you’ll need a prescription from your
doctor.

NSAIDs can sometimes cause side effects such as a headache and an upset stomach. You
shouldn't take an NSAID called diclofenac if you have heart problems.

Other painkillers you can try for painful periods include paracetamol and aspirin.
These might not work as well as NSAIDs, and aspirin can cause an upset stomach.

If you take paracetamol, you need to be careful to take only the recommended dose,
as taking too much can damage your liver.

Another treatment that can prevent or lessen period pain is the contraceptive pill.

If you also need long-term contraception, your doctor may suggest using a type of
IUD (intra-uterine device) that contains a hormone called levonorgestrel. This might
also help your period pain.

Things you can do for yourself
Some women find applying heat to their abdomen works as well as taking ibuprofen and better than taking paracetamol. And if you
combine heat and ibuprofen, your pain might go away faster.

You can try a safety-approved heating pad, or a warm bath or shower.
You can also use self-heating patches, or packs you heat in the microwave. You can
buy these in pharmacies or on the Internet.

Other treatments
Some studies have suggested that taking certain nutritional supplements may help reduce
period pain.

There has also been interest in whether acupuncture, acupressure, a transcutaneous
electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) machine, relaxation, or exercise might help as
well. But we don't know for certain if any of these works well.

It's a good idea to check with your doctor before making any changes to your lifestyle.
For example, you might want to discuss what kind of exercise might be right for you.


What will happen to me?
If you get painful periods when you're young, your period pain may get better as you
get older. Also, many women find their periods are less painful after they have had

​Ovarian torsion happens when a woman’s (or girl’s) ovary or fallopian tube becomes
twisted. This can block the blood supply to the ovary, causing it to die.

Ovarian torsion is a surgical emergency. This means that urgent surgery is needed
to correct the problem. With prompt treatment it is usually possible to save the ovary
so that fertility is not badly affected.

If you think that you or someone you are with has symptoms of ovarian torsion, seek
medical help straight away.

What is ovarian torsion?
Ovaries are part of a woman’s reproductive system. They contain the eggs that grow into embryos
when fertilised by a man’s sperm.

Women have two ovaries and two fallopian tubes. Fallopian tubes connect the ovaries to the womb (uterus).

Ovarian torsion happens when an ovary or fallopian tube - or both - becomes twisted.
This blocks some or all of the blood flow to the ovary.

If the blood supply is blocked for long enough, the ovary can no longer support the
eggs inside it. This means that the eggs cannot be released from the ovary or be fertilised.

Ovarian torsion is a surgical emergency. Prompt surgery can usually reverse the problem and save the affected ovary. But
it’s vital to get treatment quickly.

If you think that you or someone you are with has symptoms of ovarian torsion, seek medical help straight away.

Why does it happen?
Ovarian torsion usually affects women and girls of reproductive age: that means women
and girls who are able to become pregnant.

It can also happen in children of any age, and in women who have been through the
menopause. But this is much less common.

Things that make ovarian torsion more likely include:


Having one or more ovarian cysts


Having unusually long fallopian tubes


Having large ovaries


Having fertility treatment


Having cancer of the ovary, and


Being pregnant.


What are the symptoms?
The main symptoms of ovarian torsion are:


Sudden pelvic or abdominal (tummy) pain. The pain might come and go, but when it happens
it will be severe. The pain is usually so severe that most people go straight to hospital,
and



Nausea, sometimes with vomiting or diarrhoea.


You might also be able to feel a swollen lump in your abdomen. Some people also have
a fever, but this is less common.

If your doctor suspects that you have ovarian torsion, they will want to do some tests.
These will usually include:



An ultrasound scan, and possibly other imaging tests


A pregnancy test (in women and girls of childbearing age), and


A blood test.


If imaging tests show that there is torsion (twisting), then you will need surgery
straight away. But even after scans, the only way to see for certain that torsion
has happened is to have surgery.

What treatments are available?
If your doctor suspects that you have ovarian torsion, you will need emergency surgery
to correct the problem.

Most people are able to have 'keyhole' surgery. This is less 'invasive' than traditional surgery. This means that the surgeon makes
very small incisions (cuts) to do the operation.

This means that you shouldn’t need to stay in hospital as long as with open surgery.
You are also likely to have less pain, and to need less pain medication, while you
recover.

When this type of surgery is done in time, it is usually possible to save the ovary
so that it still works.

Even if an ovary can’t be saved, surgeons do not usually remove it . It is very rare
for a damaged ovary to cause problems later. But surgeons will remove a damaged ovary
if they think it could lead to problems such as infection.

If you have an ovarian cyst, the surgeon might be able to remove it during the operation to repair the torsion.
Or you might need to have a different procedure to remove the cyst at a later date.

Doctors are cautious about operating on pregnant women with ovarian torsion. The surgeon might try a different procedure to try to untwist
the ovary, using ultrasound imaging to guide the procedure.

What to expect in the future
Women and girls who have this operation can usually go home within 24 hours. Your
doctor will want to follow up with you a little while later, to check that you have
recovered well.

You can have ovarian torsion more than once. So if you have symptoms at any time after
having treatment, seek medical help urgently.

Your doctor might advise you to avoid sexual intercourse and vigorous exercise for
several weeks after your operation.

If you have a history of ovarian cysts, your doctor might suggest that you start taking
the contraceptive pill, as this can help to prevent cysts and ovarian torsion. But
this is your decision."

Most ovarian cysts are small, harmless, and go away without any treatment. Many women
don’t even know they have them. But if you have a bigger cyst it may cause you discomfort
or pain. You may need to have the cyst removed. Your doctor will do tests to make
sure the cyst is harmless and not a sign of cancer.

We've brought together the best research about ovarian cysts and weighed up the evidence
about how to treat them. You can use our information to talk to your doctor and decide
which treatments are best for you.

What are ovarian cysts?
Simple ovarian cysts are fluid-filled sacs within the ovaries. They are common and
many women have them without even knowing about them.

But an ovarian cyst can be a sign of cancer. This is more common as women get older,
and especially after the menopause. So it’s important to get any symptoms checked
out.

Cysts usually form as a reaction to hormonal changes in your body. Things that can
affect your hormone levels and lead to a cyst include:



being pregnant


having treatment for infertility


having a medical condition such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)


taking the drug tamoxifen.


Cysts may also come and go depending on your hormone levels during your menstrual
cycle.

What are the symptoms?
Most ovarian cysts are small and go away without causing any problems. Many women
who have a cyst don’t notice any symptoms. The cyst might only be noticed during an
ultrasound scan for something else – for example, if you are pregnant.

If you do get symptoms, these can include:


pain in the pelvic area, which might be to one side of the pelvis. Some women notice
this more during or after sex.



feeling bloated, needing to urinate more often, and feeling full sooner when eating.




changes to your periods. They might get heavier or lighter, or become irregular or
painful.



If you are in a lot of pain it may be that the cyst is infected or has twisted and
is cutting off blood supply to the ovary. It’s important to get this checked out straight
away. But all the symptoms listed above should be checked by a doctor if they persist.


If you have symptoms of an ovarian cyst you’ll probably be sent for an ultrasound
scan. Depending on the results, you may need a further scan to give a more detailed
picture, such as a CT, MRI, or PET. You may also need a blood test. These tests help
the doctor work out whether the cyst is harmless or whether it could be a sign of
cancer.

What treatments work?
The treatment you are offered will depend on whether you’ve been through the menopause,
whether you have symptoms, and your test results. Many women don’t need any treatment,
because the cyst will go away on its own without causing problems.

If you haven’t been through the menopause and you have a simple, fluid-filled cyst
that isn’t causing problems, your doctor may suggest you simply have another ultrasound
in a few months’ time. The cyst may have gone away. If it hasn’t, or if it’s causing
pain or discomfort, your doctor may suggest you have it removed.

If you have been through the menopause and have a simple cyst, your doctor is likely
to suggest you have an ultrasound and a blood test every two to three months, until
the cyst goes. If it doesn’t go, or if it causes problems, your doctor may suggest
that you have it removed. If your cyst gets bigger, or seems solid, your doctor will
probably suggest you have it removed without waiting.

There are two types of operation to remove a cyst: laparoscopy and laparotomy. All
operations have some risks. You can discuss these with your surgeon.

A laparoscopy is a type of keyhole surgery. You have a small cut below your belly button (navel),
and a tiny camera on a tube is fed through to your ovaries to take a look. If the
surgeon can see a cyst, he or she will probably remove it using small tools during
the same operation. This operation takes about half an hour, and you may be able to
go home from hospital the same day.

If your doctor is concerned that the cyst may be cancer, or if your cyst is very large,
you may need a laparotomy. The surgeon makes a bigger cut so he or she can see your ovaries more clearly. The
cyst will be removed and checked in the laboratory to make sure it doesn’t contain
cancer cells. It takes longer to recover from a laparotomy. You may need to stay in
hospital for a couple of days.

What will happen to me?
Most women who have ovarian cysts recover without any problems. But it’s always possible
that a cyst will come back.

If you have surgery to remove a cyst, you may be in pain for a few days afterwards.


The most alarming part of having an ovarian cyst is that your doctor will probably
want to check for ovarian cancer. But simple ovarian cysts are rarely cancerous. Even
for women who’ve been through the menopause, less than 1 in 1,000 simple cysts are
cancerous.

Solid cysts are more likely to be cancerous, especially when they occur in women who’ve
been through the menopause. Although ovarian cancer can happen to women of any age,
it’s unusual before the age of 60.

If your cyst proves to be cancerous you will need treatment for ovarian cancer."

Ovarian cancer is cancer that affects women's ovaries. It can also affect organs and
tissues near to the ovaries. It is a serious disease but if it is diagnosed at an
early stage it can usually be cured. And even cancers that are more advanced can be
treated and their progress slowed.

You can use our information to talk to your doctor and decide which treatments are
best for you.

What is ovarian cancer?
The cells in your body usually grow, die off, and get replaced in a regular way. But
if groups of cells start to grow out of control they can form a lump called a tumour.


Not all tumours are dangerous. For example, many women have growths on their ovaries
called cysts. These cysts aren’t usually cancer and they often go away by themselves.

But if they cause symptoms, or if your doctor is worried that they could be cancer,
you might be advised to have surgery to remove them.

Cancerous ovarian tumours are serious. This is partly because pieces of the tumour
can break off and spread to other parts of the body.

Most ovarian cancers start in cells on the outside of an ovary. When they spread it
tends to be to nearby organs such as the womb, bladder, and bowels, causing new spots
of cancer in these areas.

Ovarian cancer is most common in women over 50. Having a close family member with
the disease can also slightly increase your chance of getting it.

What treatments work?
The main treatment for ovarian cancer is surgery to remove the cancer. This is often
followed by chemotherapy. Between 70 and 80 in 100 women are cured by these treatments
at the first attempt.

The type and amount of treatment you need will depend on how advanced your cancer
is, or what 'stage' it's at.

When your surgeon operates, he or she might try to remove all problem tissue at the
same time as the stage is being determined.

If your cancer is at an early stage this might be the only treatment you need.
If your cancer is at a more advanced stage you will probably also need treatment with
drugs (chemotherapy) after surgery, to kill off any cancer cells that might have been
left behind.

Some women have treatment the other way around - with chemotherapy first, followed
by surgery. This is usually because they are not well enough to have surgery straight
away.

This might be because they have another medical condition that is making them ill.
These women will usually have chemotherapy to shrink their tumour as much as possible
before surgery.

Surgery
There are two types of operation to check for and remove ovarian cancer. Whichever
kind you have, you'll be given a general anaesthetic so that you'll sleep through
it.

If you have laparoscopic surgery your surgeon makes two small cuts in your abdomen.

Tiny instruments and a camera are put through the cuts to get a close look at your
ovaries, take samples of tissue (biopsies), and remove a cyst or other tissue or organ.

You should recover quicker from this surgery than from standard surgery. But if your
surgeon finds cancer he or she might need to do a laparotomy (standard surgery).

During standard surgery your surgeon makes a large cut in your abdomen to look at your ovaries.

If your surgeon finds a tumour on your ovary that could be cancer he or she will probably
remove your whole ovary. Surgeons do this because cutting away just a piece of the
ovary could let cancer cells get out.

Your surgeon will send the tumour to the laboratory immediately to check if it is
cancer. This is sometimes done during the operation.

If the laboratory finds that you have ovarian cancer your surgeon will try to remove
as much of the cancer as possible to give you the best chance of staying well.

If your cancer has spread and is at an advanced stage, your surgeon might need to
remove other affected organs, such as your womb (an operation to remove the womb,
or uterus, is called a hysterectomy), your other ovary, and fallopian tubes. You might
also need to have surgery on your bowel if it has been affected.

You'll probably need to stay in hospital for about one week after your operation.
Some people have complications after surgery that mean they need more time in hospital.
These complications include a lot of bleeding straight after your operation, blood
clots in your legs, or just taking longer than usual to heal.

But once you've recovered from the operation you should be able to do all the things
that you did before.

If you haven't already gone through the menopause you might get some of the symptoms
of it after surgery, such as hot flushes, sweating at night, and a dry vagina, as
well as thinning of your bones (osteoporosis). You can talk to your doctor about treatments
for these problems.

Having ovarian cancer is a worrying time and you might need time to adjust to what
is happening. You might not feel like having sex for some time. Let your partner know
that you need support and understanding. It might help to talk to a counsellor about
this.

Chemotherapy
Women whose cancer is at an early stage might not need chemotherapy after surgery.
But many women need this treatment, which is intended to kill off any cancer cells
left behind after surgery.

If you have chemotherapy you usually start the treatment about four weeks after your
operation. You’ll usually have between three and six treatments.

The chemotherapy is given through a tube that’s inserted into a vein (an IV or intravenous
drip). It’s usually given during the day and you won’t have to stay in hospital overnight
for this treatment.

All chemotherapy can cause side effects in some women. Different cancer drugs can
cause different side effects. But common ones include:



anaemia (a reduction in the number of red blood cells you have, which can make you
feel tired)



temporary hair loss


nausea and vomiting. You can have medicines to try and prevent this


numbness and tingling in your hands and feet


hearing problems


tiredness


being more prone to infections


mouth sores


loss of appetite.


In some women the cancer comes back after surgery and chemotherapy. It might be possible
to have more chemotherapy. Some women with cancer at an advanced stage need to have
chemotherapy injected directly into the abdomen as well as through an IV."

the disease can also slightly increase your chance of getting it.

What are the symptoms?
Most women with ovarian cancer get some symptoms in the early stages. But they are
not always recognised as being caused by ovarian cancer. This is because the symptoms
of ovarian cancer are similar to those of other, less-serious, conditions such as
indigestion or an irritable bowel.

The symptoms of ovarian cancer can include:


pain in your pelvis (your lower abdomen)


constipation


diarrhoea


feeling bloated or full after eating very little


losing weight without trying


having to urinate more often


persistent bloating or swelling, where your abdomen gets bigger and doesn't get smaller
again



bleeding from your vagina between your periods


swollen ankles


back pain


alump in your abdomen.


Your doctor will probably ask you about your symptoms and how long you have had them,
and about your general health and any illnesses in your family.

He or she will also do a physical examination. This might involve feeling your abdomen
and examining inside your vagina to check your ovaries and fallopian tubes.

You might have some tests, such as a blood test and an ultrasound scan, and maybe
an MRI scan, to look at the organs inside your abdomen.

But even after these tests your doctor probably won't be able to say for sure if you
have ovarian cancer. The only way to tell for sure is for the doctor to take samples
of tissue to be checked under a microscope. This is done in a surgical procedure.

The most common procedure is a laparotomy, where the surgeon makes a cut in the abdomen.
But sometimes the surgeon is able to do a laparoscopy, which requires a much smaller
cut. During the procedure the surgeon will remove samples of tissue from your ovary
and from other parts of your abdomen.

What will happen to me?
No one can say for sure what will happen to you if you have ovarian cancer. But, as
with most cancers, the less advanced your cancer is (the less it has spread) when
you are diagnosed, the better your chance of being cured.

What happens to you also depends on how much cancer doctors can remove during surgery
and how well you respond to chemotherapy. Remember that figures from research studies
tell us how well a lot of women do on average. But they don't predict how well you
or your cancer will respond to treatments.

Doctors can’t tell for sure what course your cancer will take. For this reason you
need to be watchful and have regular check-ups for many years after your treatment
has finished.

Future pregnancy
If both of your ovaries are taken out during surgery you won't be able to become pregnant
naturally. But if you are younger and you have not been through the menopause you
might be able to become pregnant with fertility treatments that you have planned before
your surgery.

For example, it might be possible to remove and freeze some eggs from your ovary,
or some embryos, before surgery. Or you might be able to have surgery that doesn't
remove all of your reproductive organs. You can talk to your doctor about the options
available to you before you have surgery."

An outer ear infection causes pain and trouble hearing. Outer ear infections are common
among people who swim often. Mostly, they clear up in about 10 days with the right
treatment.
What is an outer ear infection?
When you have an outer ear infection, the skin of your outer ear canal (the tube from
your ear to your eardrum) is inflamed and swollen. Doctors call this otitis externa.

Most outer ear infections are caused by bacteria. Some are caused by a fungus.
Outer ear infection may happen when your ear canal gets wet (for example, from swimming)
or damaged (for example, if you put a cotton bud inside your ear). It's more common
if you have eczema or another skin problem in your ear.

Most people get a short-lasting (acute) infection. The symptoms come on quickly and
usually get better quickly after treatment.

Both adults and children get outer ear infections.
What are the symptoms?
Pain is the main symptom of an outer ear infection. Your ear may also feel itchy and
full, as if it's blocked. Sounds may be a bit muffled. The symptoms come on quickly,
over a day or two.

To diagnose outer ear infection, your doctor will need to look into your ear.
What treatments work?
The best treatments for an outer ear infection are ear drops, which you squeeze into
your ear. There are several different types. Your doctor may prescribe antibacterial
ear drops, which kill the bacteria causing the infection.

There's good evidence that antibiotic ear drops work well to treat outer ear infection.
If you try one type and it doesn't work, your doctor may prescribe another type. If
your doctor can see that the infection is caused by a fungus, you may be given antifungal
ear drops or tablets.

If you have bits of skin and wax blocking your ear, the ear drops may not be able
to get to the infection. Your doctor may carefully clean out your ear canal before
you start using your ear drops.

You can take painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen to ease the pain.
Your ear may heal faster if you keep the ear canal dry and avoid any further damage.
Ask your doctor how long you should wait before you go swimming again. Try not to
get your ears wet in the shower. Don't scratch your ear, even if it itches.

These are some things doctors advise to cut your chances of getting another infection.


Use ear plugs when you swim.


Tip your head to get rid of any water that gets into your ear.


Avoid getting shampoo in your ears.


Don't use cotton buds to clean your ears. You may damage the ear canal.


If you have a long-lasting skin disease (chronic dermatitis) which affects your ears,
you need to get this treated. Some people need antibiotic tablets as well as ear drops.


Other treatments
If your infection lasts a long time, or if your ear is quite swollen, your doctor
may clean out your ear canal and put a thin piece of gauze soaked in medicine into
your ear canal. This will help the medicine get to the infection.

What will happen to me?
Most people who have treatment for an outer ear infection find the pain is much better
after three days, and all the symptoms are gone after 10 days. If your pain has not
gone after 10 days, go back to the doctor.

For some people, the infection becomes long-lasting (chronic). If you've got a chronic
outer ear infection, you probably had an acute outer ear infection that has not completely
gone away. Your ear remains inflamed for weeks or months. It doesn't hurt, but your
ear may feel itchy or full. It may be hard to hear.

Some people get repeated outer ear infections. If you swim a lot and have had one
ear infection, you're quite likely to get another one. Some people need regular follow-up
checks with their doctor."

If you have osteoporosis your bones are weaker than they should be and can break more
easily than is usual. It's most common among older women. So this information is mostly
about women.

If you break a bone in your spine, hip, or wrist after going through the menopause,
osteoporosis is the most likely cause. There are treatments that can slow down osteoporosis
and help protect your bones.

What treatments work?
The aim of treatment for osteoporosis is to prevent broken bones.
There are several medicines you can take to keep your bones stronger for longer. There
are also things you can do yourself to protect your bones, including taking regular
exercise and eating well. Stronger bones reduce your chances of breaking a bone.

Things you can do for yourself
Healthy eating
The best way to prevent fractures is to keep your bones as strong and healthy as you
can.

Healthy bones rely on you getting enough calcium and vitamin D. Bones are made up
largely of calcium, and your body needs vitamin D to help you absorb calcium from
food.

Good sources of calcium include dairy products like milk and yoghurt, and dark green
vegetables like spinach.

Our bodies get most of our vitamin D from sunlight. But it can be hard to get enough,
especially in the winter.

Calcium and vitamin D supplements
Taking calcium and vitamin D together may help keep your bones stronger. It's not
clear how well these supplements work in preventing fractures, but doctors recommend
them for people with osteoporosis.

Taking calcium on its own probably won’t help and is not recommended, because it can
cause heart problems.

Take care not to take more than the recommended dose of vitamin D. Too much vitamin
D can cause side effects including dizziness, fatigue, and even kidney damage.

If you have osteoporosis you should talk to your doctor before taking any supplements
or before making changes to what you take.

Exercise
Weight-bearing exercise can help keep your bones strong. This means any type of exercise
where you are putting weight on your bones, like walking and jogging.

Strengthening exercises like weight training can also help. Exercise may help you
build up strong bones when you are younger.

Improving balance can also help you to avoid falls. Activities such as tai chi can
help improve your balance.

Safety and avoiding falls
If you have osteoporosis it’s really important to do whatever you can to avoid falls.
Falling can make you more likely to break a bone. Here are some tips:



Keep your floors free of clutter


Wear shoes that fit well and support your feet


Don't walk around in socks or stockings


Have handrails on both sides of your stairs


Use a rubber mat in your bath or shower


Keep a torch by your bed for when you need to get up at night.


Medicines
The medicines most often used to treat or prevent osteoporosis are tablets called
bisphosphonates. They help prevent fractures by slowing down the rate at which old bone gets broken
down.

These drugs are usually taken as tablets. But some bisphosphonates can be given through
an intravenous (IV) drip once a year.

Bisphosphonates can cause side effects in some people. For example, when taken as
tablets they can irritate the tube that runs from your throat to your stomach (your
oesophagus). This can cause discomfort and problems like ulcers in your oesophagus.

To make this less likely you should swallow the tablets whole, with a big glass of
plain water, and stay upright for at least an hour after taking them.

Bisphosphonates have also been linked to some more serious side effects, although
these are rare. These include a bone disease in the jaw, irregular heart beat, stress
fractures (caused by wear and tear on weak bones), and bone pain.

Other medicines for post-menopausal women
The main drug treatments for women who develop osteoporosis after the menopause are
bisphosphonates. But there are other options.

Drugs called selective oestrogen receptor modulators (SERMs for short) are sometimes used to treat osteoporosis. They can help reduce the chance of fractures
of the vertebrae (the bones in the spine).

SERMs can cause side effects in some people. They slightly increase your chances of
getting blood clots and stroke. More common problems include hot flushes and leg cramps.

Drugs called monoclonal antibodies are now used in some countries for strengthening bones in women with osteoporosis.
But it can cause side effects, including an increased chance of serious infection
and damage to the bones in the jaw.

Medicines called parathyroid hormone (PTH) receptor agonists are sometimes used to help women with very weak bones or who have had several fractures,
and who can't take bisphosphonates.

But, again, they can cause side effects. For example, using these medicines for too
long can actually cause bones to become weaker. Your doctor will monitor you carefully
if you take this treatment.

It used to be common for women to take hormone replacement therapy (HRT for short)
after the menopause. HRT does help keep bones stronger after the menopause, but the
benefits are no longer thought to outweigh the risks.

This is because HRT can slightly increase your chances of getting other serious health
problems, such as breast cancer, a heart attack, a stroke, and blood clots.

HRT is now usually only recommended for women with severe osteoporosis who can't take
other treatments.

Medicines for men
As with women, the main medicines used to treat osteoporosis in men are bisphosphonates.
But, as with women, some men have weaker bones for hormonal reasons. In particular,
low levels of the hormone testosterone can cause bone weakness in some men.

We're not sure whether testosterone supplements can help strengthen bones and reduce
fractures. But some doctors might suggest this as a treatment if your testosterone
level is low.

As for women, monoclonal antibodies and PTH receptor agonists are sometimes used for
men with very weak bones or who have had several fractures, and who can't take bisphosphonates.
But these treatments may not be available everywhere.

Osteoporosis caused by steroid medications
Many people take anti-inflammatory medicines called corticosteroids for various conditions,
including severe asthma and some types of arthritis. But when people take them for
a long time they can cause weaker bones.

It's recommended that people taking long-term corticosteroids should also take medications
such as bisphosphonates to strengthen their bones, as well as calcium and vitamin
D supplements.

If you need to take corticosteroids for more than a few months your doctor should
talk with you about medicines for osteoporosis."

about osteoporosis in women.

If you break a bone in your spine, hip, or wrist after going through the menopause,
osteoporosis is the most likely cause. There are treatments that can slow down osteoporosis
and help protect your bones.

What is osteoporosis?
Bone is a living, growing part of your body. New bone cells are being made all the
time and old bone cells broken down.

When you are young you make new bone faster than old bone breaks down. So as you grow
as a child and a teenager your bones become stronger.

But as you age old bone is broken down faster than new bone is made. This starts at
about the age of 35 and speeds up as you get older. But in some people it happens
faster than normal. This makes their bones thinner and more likely to break. Those
people have osteoporosis.

Osteoporosis happens more to women than to men. The changes in hormones at the menopause
speed up the thinning process in the bones. Osteoporosis is also more common in people
who have to take steroid tablets for other conditions.

Doctors use a measurement called the bone mineral density (BMD) score when talking
about how severe your osteoporosis is. Doctors call this a T-score. The T-score measures
how dense your bones are compared with those of young, healthy women.



A T-score of 1 to -1 means your bones are normal.


A T-score of -1 to -2.5 means your bones are a bit weak. This is called osteopenia.


A T-score below -2.5 means you have osteoporosis.


The T-score comes from a type of bone scan, called a DXA scan.
What are the symptoms?
The main symptoms of osteoporosis are:


Breaking bones because they have become weak. You may not know you have osteoporosis
until you break a bone.



Back pain caused by fractures in the vertebrae (the bones in the spine). You may not
even know that your back pain is caused by a fracture.



Hunching of the back (called kyphosis).


Many people break their bones without having osteoporosis. But this is usually because
they have a bad accident. If you have osteoporosis your bones break more easily than
that. For example, you might break your hip if you fall and land on it, whereas someone
without osteoporosis wouldn't break their hip. Or you might fracture your wrist by
using your hand to break a fall.

The bones most likely to break in people with osteoporosis are those in the spine,
hip, and wrist.

Your doctor may be able to say that you have osteoporosis just from talking with you
and examining you. But you will probably need a DXA scan to say for sure.

If you have osteoporosis or osteopenia you will probably be offered a regular DXA
scan, so that doctors can check up on how strong your bones are.

What will happen to me?
If you have osteoporosis you may worry about your future. But, while it's true that
your chance of having a fracture is higher than most people's, it doesn't mean that
it will definitely happen to you.

Taking measures to prevent falls, eating well, taking the right supplements, and getting
the right treatments from your doctor can reduce your chance of breaking a bone.

It’s important to do what you can to prevent breaks, especially as we age. Older people
recover more slowly from broken bones. And some breaks, especially a broken hip, can
make it hard for people to live independently afterwards.

Where to get more help
As with many conditions, there may be charities and support groups where you live
that can help with advice, information, and support.

For example, in the UK, the National Osteoporosis Society is a charity that works
to improve the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of osteoporosis and fractures
caused by osteoporosis. Its details are available via the painuk.org website.

Your doctor may be able to tell you about organisations and support groups in your
area."

https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/3000057/Osteomyelitis,Osteomyelitis,"Osteomyelitis Last published: Apr 25, 2022
Osteomyelitis is an infection in a bone. It can happen for several reasons, such as
an infection spreading from another part of the body, or if your immune system is
weakened.
Osteomyelitis can often be treated with antibiotics if it is diagnosed early. But
some people need to have surgery.
What is osteomyelitis?
Infections are common, and we all get them from time to time, most commonly in the
throat, chest, or ears. But infections can also happen in our bones. When this happens
it’s called osteomyelitis.

Osteomyelitis can happen for several reasons, including when:


an infection spreads from other tissues


a bone is damaged by an injury


an infection spreads from a prosthetic (artificial) joint, such as a hip or knee replacement


an infection starts after you have surgery.


Some things that can make osteomyelitis more likely include:


injecting recreational (‘street’) drugs


having diabetes


having HIV


having an infection of the gums called periodontitis. This infection can spread to
the teeth and the bone in the jaw.




What are the symptoms?
As with any infection, the first symptoms you might notice are fever, fatigue (tiredness),
and feeling generally unwell. You might also notice:



pain in the part of your body where the infection is


difficulty moving the infected limb


redness and swelling in the joint nearest the infection


weeping from any sore or open wound.


If your doctor suspects a bone infection, he or she will examine you and ask you about
your symptoms and what other medical conditions you have. Your doctor will also ask
whether you have had surgery recently, or suffered any injury.

There are some tests that can help to tell if you have an infected bone. These include:


scans, such as ultrasound or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging)


blood tests


tests on the fluid in any joint that is affected. In this test, the fluid is taken
from the joint with a needle.



tests on any fluid that comes from an abscess (open sore).



What treatments work?
The treatment you will need depends on several things, including:


whether the infection is diagnosed early


whether you have any other medical conditions that could make treating the infection
difficult



how badly the bone has been affected.


Antibiotics
Bone infections are almost always caused by bacteria. So the main treatment is antibiotics.
Antibiotics are drugs that kill bacteria.

Different antibiotics work against different bacteria. So the antibiotics you need
will depend on which type of bacteria has caused your infection.

If your infection is diagnosed early, antibiotics might be the only treatment that
you need. You will probably need to have intravenous (IV) antibiotics several times
over a two-week period. You will then need to take antibiotic tablets for another
few weeks.

It is vital that you take the tablets exactly as your doctor advises, so that you
have the best chance of getting rid of the infection completely.

Your doctor might also prescribe painkillers to help relieve any pain in the infected
area.

Surgery
For many people, antibiotics are not enough to get rid of the infection, and they
need surgery. You might also need surgery if:



some of the infected bone tissue has died. This is called osteonecrosis


a joint is affected by the infection. This is called septic arthritis.


Before the operation your surgeon will probably take small samples of bone from the
affected area. Testing these samples in the lab will help show which type of bacteria
is involved, and how much bone is affected.

In the operation, the surgeon will remove any dead bone. He or she will then pack
the space left after removing the dead bone with filler material that slowly releases
antibiotics.

There are several types of filler material. Some of them need to be removed a few
weeks after the operation, while others dissolve on their own.

If a lot of bone needs to be removed, the limb might need to be shortened slightly.
Your surgeon should discuss with you everything about your surgery, and you should
ask any questions that you want to.

After the surgery you will need to take antibiotics for several weeks.
Other options
Surgery for osteomyelitis can be complicated, and recovery can take a long time, especially
if you have other medical conditions. So some people who are offered surgery choose
not to have it, especially if the possible risks of having surgery might be greater
than the benefits.

These people might need to be treated with short courses of antibiotics when their
symptoms flare up. It doesn’t cure the infection, but it helps to manage it.

What will happen?
Most people who only need antibiotics recover fully with no complications. But some
people need to have a second course of treatment.

If you need surgery, recovery takes longer. You might need to have rehabilitation
to help you to strengthen the affected limb. And you might need to wear a frame to
support the limb for a while. Your doctor should see you often and keep a close eye
on your recovery.

Your doctor should discuss with you the things that you can do to help prevent the
infection returning. These include taking care of your general health (for example,
eating a healthy diet), practising good hygiene, not smoking, and not injecting recreational
drugs.

Your doctor should also advise you about signs that suggest that the infection might
be coming back, such as redness, fever, and pain. If you notice any of these signs,
get medical help straight away for the best chance of treating the infection."

Osteoarthritis can make your joints stiff and painful. This can make it hard to do
everyday things, such as getting up out of a chair or tying a shoelace, and sometimes
even walking.

There is no cure for osteoarthritis, but there are treatments that can help control
the pain and discomfort it causes and help you move more freely.

Some of these treatments involve taking medicines, and some people need to have surgery.
But there are some things you can try that don't involve drugs or surgical treatments.

Non-drug treatments
There are several things you can try for reducing pain and increasing mobility. Different
things work for different people. The important thing is to find what works for you.

Exercising moderately and regularly can help reduce pain and help you stay active and move more
easily. Exercise can also help lift your mood.

Some people might worry that exercise will damage their joints even more. But there
are plenty of types of exercise that don't harm your joints.

If you're concerned, you can discuss with your doctor what kind of exercise might
suit you best.

Weight loss is likely to help if you have knee osteoarthritis and you are overweight. Losing
some weight will help reduce your pain.

A knee brace can help some people with knee osteoarthritis. It works by helping to align the knee
properly. You can ask your doctor or physiotherapist about having a brace fitted.

Acupuncture has been tried by many people with osteoarthritis. Research is unclear about how
well it works. But some people find that it helps them, especially for knee osteoarthritis.

Drug treatments
If you find that non-drug treatments don't control your symptoms as much as you'd
like, your doctor will probably recommend medicines. These can vary from creams and
gels to injections.

Pain-relieving creams and gels
The first medicines your doctor might suggest are creams and gels that you rub onto
the affected areas. You might hear your doctor describe these as 'topical' treatments.

Creams and gels that are commonly used for osteoarthritis include capsaicin, methylsalicylate,
and gels that contain non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and diclofenac.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
If gels and creams don't help enough, your doctor may recommend painkillers in tablet
form, usually NSAIDs. Many people use creams and gels as well as painkillers in tablet
form.

NSAIDs can work well to control pain in many people. However, when taken regularly
these medicines can have side effects.

For example, some NSAIDs can cause stomach problems, and some have been linked to
heart problems and kidney damage when taken over long periods in high doses.

Some NSAIDs are available without prescription, so if you take them regularly you
should tell your doctor. He or she may suggest that you have a blood test to check that they are not affecting your kidneys.

If you are prescribed NSAIDs to take for a long time your doctor will probably prescribe
another medicine to protect your stomach. People who have heart problems should not take an NSAID called diclofenac.

Paracetamol
Research suggests that paracetamol on its own doesn't work very well to relieve the pain of osteoarthritis. But doctors
sometimes recommend it along with your usual pain relief if you are suddenly in a
lot of pain.

As with all drugs, you should take care not to take more than the recommended dose.
Opioids and corticosteroids
If you have more severe symptoms your doctor may prescribe stronger NSAIDs, or opioid painkillers such as tramadol.

Opioids can cause dependence (addiction) if taken for long periods. So if you take
opioids for your pain your doctor should monitor you carefully.

For pain that flares up and becomes bad very suddenly (called an exacerbation) your doctor might recommend injections in the joint of powerful anti-inflammatory
drugs called corticosteroids.

These injections work well to reduce pain for many people. The effects last up to
four weeks.

But these injections can cause serious side effects if you have them regularly, including:



weight gain


bone weakness, and


thinning of the skin.


So your doctor will want to keep an eye on how often you have this treatment.
Supplements
You should always tell your doctor if you are taking supplements along with medications. Some people with osteoarthritis take the dietery supplements
glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate to help with pain.

These are probably harmless, but the ones you can buy from a pharmacy vary in quality.
Your doctor might be able to prescribe a more effective version of these supplements.

Surgery
If your symptoms are severe your doctor may suggest that you have surgery. In surgery
for osteoarthritis, badly damaged hip and knee joints can be replaced with artificial
joints.

Hip or knee replacement surgery usually works well. There’s a good chance that the pain and stiffness in your joint
will go away completely after a replacement operation.

But these are serious operations. They may not be suitable for everybody, and recovery
can take several months.

Another type of operation for knee osteoarthritis, called an osteotomy, involves removing a small piece of bone from the knee. It can help reduce pain and
improve movement.

An alternative to hip replacement is hip resurfacing, which involves replacing the surfaces of the hip joint with artificial coverings.

Metal-on-metal (MoM) hip replacements
Some studies have found that one type of hip replacement, called a metal-on-metal
hip (because both replacement parts are made of metal), might be more likely than
other kinds to cause problems or need to be replaced.

If you think you may have had an MoM replacement or resurfacing, or if you're not
sure what kind you had and are worried, talk to your doctor.

In many countries, such as the UK, hip surgery does not involve MoM parts, but your
doctor will be able to tell you if it affects you. If you have had MoM hip replacement
or resurfacing, you may have to have more regular testing to make sure everything
is okay.

There is no cure for osteoarthritis, but there are treatments that can help relieve
the symptoms and help you move more easily.

What happens in osteoarthritis?
Osteoarthritis is a condition that affects joints. It's most common in the joints
of the knees, hips, hands, and spine.

Osteoarthritis happens when the cartilage at the ends of bones becomes damaged. Cartilage is a hard, slippery material that coats the end of a bone where it meets another
bone. It allows bones to move smoothly against each other without rubbing together.


When cartilage is damaged, the bone in your joints tries to repair the damage (bone
can grow and mend itself).

But instead of making things better, in osteoarthritis the bone grows abnormally and
makes things worse. For example, the bone can grow into a knobbly shape and make the
joint painful and unstable.

No one really understands why bone does this. And it's not clear if the cartilage
damage happens before or after the bone grows abnormally.

Although osteoarthritis is not caused simply by ageing or by wear and tear of the
cartilage at the end of the bones, it is more common in older people. Other things
that make you more likely to get osteoarthritis include:



being overweight


being a woman


having osteoarthritis in your family.


What are the symptoms?
The symptoms of osteoarthritis usually develop slowly, sometimes over many years.
The most common ones are:



pain. This may be constant or it might happen only when you use a particular joint.
It can be burning, aching, or sharp



stiffness. This is usually at its worst first thing in the morning


problems moving: for example, you may find it hard to climb stairs or reach a high
shelf



swollen joints


a crunching feeling in your joints when you move them


knobbly joints


muscle weakness around an affected joint.


Your doctor will ask you about your symptoms and look at your joints. He or she may
also order some tests, such as an x-ray and blood test, to check whether your symptoms are caused by osteoarthritis or whether something
else might be causing them.

What will happen to me?
Osteoarthritis is a condition that usually, but not always, progresses very slowly,
often over many years.

The pain and stiffness may even get better with time, especially with treatment. But
it's hard to predict what will happen to you as an individual.

Research suggests that you may be able to avoid developing severe symptoms by keeping
your weight at a healthy level and staying mobile.

Oral thrush is an infection some people get in their mouth and throat. It's caused
by a fungus called Candida. Thrush can make your mouth sore, but it can usually be
easily treated with drugs. There are also things you can do to reduce your chances
of getting it again.
You can use our information to talk to your doctor about the best treatments for you.
Treating mild to moderate oral thrush
Oral thrush is usually treated with antifungal medicines. If your symptoms are mild
and you don’t have any pain you will probably be offered antifungals in the form of
liquid to swirl around your mouth or tablets to suck or put in your cheek.

These are called topical medicines. This type of antifungal works to clear up the infection in most children and adults.


Treating more severe oral thrush
Some people get more severe symptoms, including pain and a burning feeling in their
mouth. People with these symptoms usually need antifungal tablets.

These tablets are more powerful than the topical treatments, but doctors are unlikely
to prescribe them unless your symptoms are severe. This is because they are more likely
than the topical medicines to cause side effects. These can include vomiting, diarrhoea, headaches, and rashes.

In some people, these drugs can cause more serious side effects, such as liver damage.
If you need to take antifungals for more than a few weeks, your doctor should make
sure that you have regular check-ups to make sure this isn’t happening.

Treating stubborn infections
People whose infections don’t respond to the usual antifungal tablets can be treated
with other drugs, and sometimes with antifungals given by a drip (an intravenous or
‘IV’ treatment).

This is usually only used for the most serious infections, because these treatments
can cause side effects in some people, including headache, fever, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea.

Prevention in people whose immune systems are severely weakened
Some people, such as those with HIV or who are having treatment for cancer, may need
treatment with antifungals to prevent oral thrush infection. This is because these
people’s immune systems are so weak that an infection would be more serious for them
than for most people.

Babies born prematurely, or who have a very low birth weight, may also sometimes need
treatment to make sure they don’t get a thrush infection that could become serious."

You can use our information to talk to your doctor about the best treatments for you.
What is oral thrush?
Oral thrush is an infection that can affect almost any part of your mouth and throat.
It’s caused by a type of fungus called Candida. The most common variety is called
Candida albicans. The medical name for thrush is candidiasis.

It's normal to have a small amount of Candida in your body, including on your skin
and in your mouth. This is usually harmless and doesn't cause any symptoms.

But sometimes Candida grows out of control and you get a candidiasis infection in
your mouth. You can get thrush on your tongue, your gums, on the inside of your cheeks,
on the roof of your mouth, or in your throat.

You can also get thrush in many other parts of your body, such as your skin or your
groin. Babies can get thrush in their nappy area. And women can get thrush in their
vagina.

Who gets oral thrush?
Some people are more likely than others to get oral thrush. This is usually because
they have another health problem that makes thrush more likely, or because they are
taking medicines that weaken their immune system.

Your immune system helps your body fight off infections. When it's weakened, types
of fungus that usually live in your body without causing any problems can grow out
of control.

People who are more likely to get oral thrush include:


People whose immune systems are weakened by medical treatments, such as anti-cancer
(chemotherapy) drugs, steroids (their full name is corticosteroids), or radiotherapy



People whose immune systems are weakened by other condidions, such as AIDS and leukaemia


People with diabetes. If you've got diabetes, you have too much sugar in your blood.
Thrush grows best in a high-sugar environment, which can happen if sugar levels in
your blood and saliva are high. Oral thrush can be caused by both type 1 and type
2 diabetes



People with asthma who take corticosteroids through an inhaler


Those with a severe, long-term dry mouth. Thrush grows more easily in a mouth where
there isn't much saliva. You can get a dry mouth when you take certain drug treatments,
and after radiotherapy or surgery on your neck or head.



Babies are also more likely to get oral thrush because their immune systems aren’t
fully developed.

Oral thrush is also more common in people who:


Smoke


Wear badly fitting dentures or have poor oral hygiene


Have recently taken antibiotics (antibiotics can kill friendly bacteria as well as
harmful bacteria, and this can allow thrush to grow)



Are malnourished.


What are the symptoms of oral thrush?
Oral thrush usually appears as white patches in your mouth.
Your mouth may feel sore and you may get a burning feeling on your tongue.
If you've got thrush in your throat, you may not be able to speak or eat properly.
This can make you feel very unwell. Some people find that things taste different when
they have oral thrush or that some foods are painful to swallow.

There are four main types of oral thrush, and they can look quite different.


Small white patches on the inside of the cheeks, throat, tongue, or gums. The patches
come off if you rub them, and they may bleed. This is the most common type of oral
thrush.



Smooth red patches on the roof of your mouth, the back of your tongue, or the inside
of your cheeks.



A type of thrush called angular cheilitis is swelling of the angles of the mouth.
The corners of the mouth can looked cracked, scaly, crusty, or red.



People who wear dentures can get redness and swelling on the roof of their mouth or
around their gums where their dentures come into contact with their mouth.



Your dentist may discover you've got oral thrush when you go for a check-up, and may
give you some medicine to treat it.

If you've got any of the symptoms listed above, or if the inside of your mouth looks
different from usual, you should see your doctor. Your doctor will probably:



Look inside your mouth for white or red patches


Ask you about your symptoms.


Sometimes the doctor will take a sample from the affected part of your mouth to test
it for Candida.

If the patches in your mouth are still there after you've had medicines to get rid
of oral thrush, your doctor may refer you to a specialist.

What to expect in the future
If you don't have treatment for oral thrush it can go on for months, or it could keep
coming back after it clears up.

It's especially important to have any white or red patches in your mouth checked out
and treated. These patches could be a sign of another condition or, rarely, of the
beginnings of cancer.

In young babies, oral thrush usually clears up on its own within a few weeks."

Oral thrush is an infection some people get in their mouth and throat. It's caused
by a fungus called Candida. Thrush can make your mouth sore, but it can usually be
easily treated with medicines.
There are also things you can do to reduce your chances of getting oral thrush again.




If you smoke, the best thing to do is to stop. You can have treatment to help you
stop smoking. Your doctor or pharmacist can provide advice.



If you have a dry mouth, your doctor may recommend treatments to add moisture. These
might include special chewing gum or mouth wash, or artificial saliva.



If you wear dentures, always keep your dentures clean, especially the surface that's
in contact with the roof of your mouth. This is because Candida can grow on dentures.
Also, leave your dentures out at night.



If you have diabetes, keeping your blood sugar under control can reduce your chance
of oral thrush. This means regularly testing your blood sugar level (or getting it
tested), taking your diabetes medicine correctly, and following the advice of your
doctor.



If you have asthma and take corticosteroids through an inhaler, the medicine can sometimes
cause oral thrush. You can reduce the chance of this happening by rinsing your mouth
out after using the inhaler, and ensuring a good inhaler technique. It may also help
to use a spacing device. This device makes it easier to inhale without too much of
the medicine touching your mouth and throat.



If you developed oral thrush after taking antibiotics, be sure to tell your doctor
if you need antibiotics again. Your doctor may be able to prescribe an antibiotic
that is less likely to increase your chance of oral thrush.



If your immune system is weakened (for example, if you have HIV, or are receiving
radiation or chemotherapy for cancer), your doctor can provide advice about managing
your condition and helping to prevent oral thrush."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/3000075/Opioid-use%20disorder,Opioid-use disorder,"Opioid-use disorder Last published: Aug 30, 2022
An opioid drug can be a prescription pain-killing medicine or an illegal ‘street’
drug, such as heroin. When someone abuses opioids by regularly taking them to get
‘high’, this is called opioid-use disorder.

Opioid abuse is extremely dangerous. It can lead to serious health problems and to
death by overdose. If you are concerned about your opioid abuse, or about someone
you know, you can use our information to talk to your doctor about getting help.

What is opioid-use disorder?
Opioids can be either natural substances or chemical compounds designed to work in
the same way. They are called opioids because their effect is similar to that of the
drug opium.

Opioids are widely used medically to relieve pain. But they are also widely abused.
Commonly abused opioids include codeine, fentanyl, heroin, morphine, opium, methadone,
oxycodone, and hydrocodone.

When regular opioid abuse causes someone physical or mental problems, this is called
opioid-use disorder. Opioids are addictive. So once your body gets used to them it
can be extremely hard to stop using them.

Most people are aware of heroin abuse. But in recent years there has been a large
increase in the abuse of prescription opioids.

This often happens because people who take them for pain become addicted. They then
find that they need to take a bigger dose to get the same effect. This can lead to
accidental overdose and death.

Many thousands of people die each year from abusing opioids. Many of these deaths
involve prescription opioids. This has become known as the ‘opioid epidemic’.

As well as death by overdose, opioid abuse causes health problems including:


severe malnutrition


bone, skin, and heart infections


infections such as HIV and hepatitis, from injecting opioids with dirty needles


infections such as HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases from unsafe sex while
under the influence of drugs



blood clots (deep vein thrombosis) from injecting drugs


withdrawal symptoms, such as muscle cramps, diarrhoea, anxiety, and tremors.


Like any drug problem, opioid-use disorder can also lead to non-medical problems,
including:



serious financial troubles


legal problems


missing work and school


loss of employment, and


family and relationship problems.


For people using heroin, the drug itself is not the only danger. People who produce
illegal street drugs ‘cut’ them with other substances to bulk them out so that they
make more money.

Some of these substances are extremely dangerous and can cause death. Bulking out
heroin also means that people don’t know how much to use when their supply changes.
This can lead to an overdose.

Addiction to opioids starts in many ways. Things that can make someone more likely
to abuse opioids include:



social influences. For example, if some of your family or friends use opioids it might
be easy for you to get hold of them. Or you might be pressured to use them socially



mental-health problems. People with mental-health conditions such as bipolar disorder,
attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), depression, anxiety, personality
disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and psychosis are more likely to
abuse drugs and alcohol. This is because drugs give some temporary relief from the
mental-health problems. But in time the drugs usually make the problems worse



your genes. Some people are more likely than others to become addicted to drugs simply
because of their genes.



Whatever the cause of your problem, help is available. Talking to your doctor can
be the first step to recovery.

What are the symptoms?
Many people start to get help with opioid addiction when they have emergency medical
treatment for an overdose or for other problems linked to their opioid abuse, such
as bad withdrawal symptoms. Or they might need medical treatment while in legal custody.

So medical staff often see people showing the symptoms of the effects of opioids (intoxication
or being ‘high’) or of withdrawal from them.

When someone is in a state of opioid intoxication their symptoms can include:


confusion


drowsiness or unconsciousness


being unable to pay attention


having little or no interest in what is going on around you


slow thought processes and physical movements


slurred speech.


Symptoms of withdrawal from opioids include:


craving for opioid drugs


muscle aches or cramps


stomach cramps


nausea or vomiting


recurrent chills


an unusually fast heartbeat.


Behaviours linked to long-term opioid abuse and addiction could also be described
as symptoms. These include:



using larger amounts of opioids or over a longer period than you intended to


repeated failed attempts to cut down or stop using opioids


spending a lot of time and effort getting hold of opioids and recovering from using
them



cravings for opioids


failing to meet obligations at work, school, or with your family because of your opioid
use



continuing to use opioids despite the problems they cause you: for example, with work
or money



continuing to use opioids despite the danger to your physical and mental health


missing other activities so that you can use opioids


using opioids in physically dangerous situations.


Even though medical staff are familiar with the symptoms of opioid intoxication and
withdrawal, they might still want to do urine and blood tests, or both, to be sure.
These tests can also tell what other substances you might have taken.

What treatments work?
Beating opioid addiction is hard. Doctors understand this. They know that the treatment
can take time, and that it needs to include both medical and what’s called ‘psychosocial’
support.



Medical support means using medications to help your body cope without opioids, and
with withdrawal symptoms.



Psychosocial support means looking at the reasons why you abused opioids and helping
you not to use them again. These could be any problems in your life that made you
want to take drugs, or mental-health issues, or social reasons, such as unemployment
or pressure from friends.



Detoxification
Treatment for opioid-use disorder happens in two stages. The first is detoxification
or ‘detox’. This means stopping using opioids so that the drugs are no longer in your
body.

Detox doesn’t just mean stopping using opioids and being left to suffer withdrawal
symptoms (going ‘cold turkey’). It is done using one or more medications that help
the body through withdrawal. One that you might have heard of is called methadone,
but there are others.

These medicines can be given for short periods, or for longer if needed. Depending
on how severe someone’s addiction is, and on any other health problems you have, detox
can either be done at home or as an inpatient.

Your doctor might also suggest medicines to help relieve withdrawal symptoms such
as diarrhoea, vomiting, and painful cramps.

Stabilisation and maintenance
This is the second stage of treatment. After detox, the aim is to stop you from using
opioids again (relapsing). Continuing treatment after completion of detoxification
is essential due to the high risk of relapse.

This stage of treatment might involve continued use of medications to help you not
to use opioids, and it should involve continued psychosocial care. This might mean
having regular sessions with a counsellor or therapist, possibly as part of a drug-treatment
programme.

Pregnancy
Treatment for pregnant women with opioid dependence is usually different from that
for other people. This is because detox can cause distress for the mother and premature
birth (the baby being born too early).

So pregnant women addicted to opioids are usually helped through their pregnancy before
detox. Babies born to mothers who used opioids during pregnancy are closely monitored
for any problems in the months after they are born.

What will happen?
Your doctor will probably want to keep an eye on you while you recover: for example,
to make sure that you are eating properly and getting healthy, and to make sure you
haven’t suffered any serious organ damage, such as damage to your liver.

If you are taking part in a drug-treatment programme you might also have regular urine
tests, to check that you are not using drugs.

Unfortunately the treatment that people need for opioid-use disorder is not always
available when and where they need it. But your doctor will recommend that you join
a drug-treatment programme if one is available.

But even if you get the best available treatment, what happens next depends on how
much you want to stop using opioids. Even if you are determined, beating drug addiction
is hard. And many people need to make several attempts before they stop for good.

Some people find it useful to get support from groups such as Narcotics Anonymous.
But this approach doesn’t suit everyone. You can talk to your doctor or counsellor
about what might be the right approach for you."

This type of cancer affects the oesophagus, which is the ‘food pipe’ that connects
your throat to your stomach. Oesophageal cancer is often only found late, when it
has already spread. So if you get symptoms it’s important to see your doctor quickly.

You can use our information to talk with your doctor about what treatments are best
for you.
What is oesophageal cancer?
The cells in our bodies usually grow, then die off and get replaced in a regular way.
But if cells start to multiply in an uncontrolled way, they can form a growth called
a tumour. Without treatment, tumours can grow and spread to other parts of the body.
This is how most cancers happen.

As the name suggests, oesophageal cancer is cancer that grows in the wall of the oesophagus.
The oesophagus is the tube or pipe that connects your throat with your stomach. Food
passes down your oesophagus to reach your stomach where it starts to be digested.


Like many cancers, it’s hard to say exactly what causes oesophageal cancer. But there
are things that increase the chances of it happening, including:



having regular heartburn or ‘acid reflux’ over a long period (the medical name for
regular heartburn is gastro-oesophageal reflux disease or GORD)



having a condition called Barrett’s oesophagus. This happens when long-term GORD causes
changes in the cells in your oesophagus, making it easier for cancer to develop



being overweight


being male


being older


eating a poor diet that’s high in fat and low in fresh fruit and vegetables


smoking


drinking too much alcohol.



What are the symptoms?
Most people with oesophageal cancer have had it for some time by the time it is diagnosed.


This is often because the symptoms might not become obvious until the cancer is fairly
advanced, or because people don’t realise that heartburn could be a sign of something
more serious.

Typical symptoms are:


regular heartburn or ‘acid reflux’


difficulty swallowing. For example, you might find it painful to swallow food


weight loss. This happens because people find it painful to swallow food, so they
eat less.



Other, less typical symptoms that don’t happen to everyone can include:


hoarseness


being prone to hiccups


coughing after eating.


If you have had heartburn regularly for several months, and especially if you have
difficulty swallowing, see your doctor as soon as possible.

Of course, having heartburn doesn’t usually mean that you have cancer: most of the
time it’s just a sign that you need to eat a more healthy diet, with more fresh fruit
and vegetables and less processed food. But getting heartburn checked can rule out
something more serious.

If your doctor thinks you might have oesophageal cancer, or another problem with your
oesophagus, he or she will probably want to do a test called an endoscopy.

This involves your doctor passing a small camera down your throat on a thin tube.
The doctor can then see if anything is wrong with your oesophagus.

If the endoscopy finds anything unusual in your oesophagus, such as a lump, your doctor
will take a sample of cells from it for testing, using a needle.

This test is called a biopsy. These cells are then checked under a microscope to see if they are cancer cells,
or something else.

If you have a tumour, you will then need to have a scan, such as a CT (computerised tomography) or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). Using
these scans, a specialist cancer doctor (called an oncologist) can tell what size
the tumour is and whether it has spread to nearby tissues.

Another type of scan, called a PET (positron emission tomography) scan can tell if
the cancer has spread to more distant parts of the body.

These scans are important in deciding the kind of treatment you might need.
You might hear this process called ‘staging’. Oesophageal cancer is divided into four
stages, with stage 1 being the least advanced (early stage) and stage 4 being the
most advanced (late stage).

If you have oesophageal cancer, your oncologist will explain what stage it is, and
what treatments might be most helpful.

What treatments are available?
Surgery
The usual treatment for oesophageal cancer is surgery to remove the tumour and, sometimes,
other tissues affected by it. This is usually possible if the cancer is at an early
stage, meaning that it is not too large and has not spread too far into other tissues.


Surgery for oesophageal cancer is a major operation. Like all surgeries, it has risks,
such as infection. For example, some people get pneumonia after this surgery. And
a small number of people do not survive the operation.

You can talk with your doctor about the possible risks of surgery and about what you
want to happen. All decisions about your treatment should be yours. You don’t have
to have any treatments that you don’t want.

If you choose to have surgery, you will probably also need to have one or two other
treatments, depending on the stage of your tumour. These treatments improve the chances
of killing all the cancer cells.

You might have heard of these treatments, as they are commonly used to treat many
cancers.



Chemotherapy means using medicines to stop cancer cells from multiplying.



Radiotherapy uses local radiation treatment to kill cancer cells.



These treatments can be used after surgery. But they are often used to shrink tumours
before surgery, to make them easier to remove.

Other treatments
Not everyone with oesophageal cancer can have surgery.
For example, if you are in poor general health or have other serious illnesses, you
might not be well enough to have surgery. And some people’s cancer has spread too
far for surgery to be helpful.

If you can’t have surgery, you might be able to have other treatments, including chemotherapy
and radiotherapy. Without surgery, these treatments are unlikely to cure your cancer,
but they can help you to live longer and relieve some of the symptoms.

Other possible treatments for people who can’t have surgery are laser treatment to kill cancer cells, and cryotherapy, which kills tumours by freezing them.

But these treatments can’t help with advanced cancers that have spread too far from
the oesophagus into other tissues.

What to expect after treatment
If you have had surgery for oesophageal cancer you will have a check-up and an endoscopy
every few months to check your progress. These check-ups might continue for several
years.

Unfortunately, oesophageal cancer is one of the most dangerous cancers. Survival rates
are improving, especially for early-stage cancer. But they are still poor compared
with many other cancers.

Depending on how far the cancer has spread, between 5 and 50 in every 100 people are
still alive 5 years after treatment. Early treatment gives the best chance of a good
outcome.

If these numbers look worrying, remember that 5-year survival doesn’t mean that people
are only expected to live for 5 years after treatment.

It just means that that's how long most studies last, because it's hard to keep up
with people for longer than that. Many people live for many years after their treatment."

Obsessive-compulsive disorder can be distressing, and can make it hard for you to
get on with life. But there are treatments that can help.

You can use our information to talk with your doctor and decide which treatments are
right for you.

What is obsessive-compulsive disorder?
If you have obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), you have disturbing thoughts that
you can't get out of your head. You may also do certain things over and over again,
even though you don't want to.

The disturbing thoughts are called obsessions. And the things you do repeatedly are
called compulsions. People with obsessive-compulsive disorder often get both.

OCD causes a lot of unnecessary worry and anxiety.
All of us worry needlessly from time to time - it's very common to worry that you've
left the cooker on, or check more than once that you've locked the door.

But for people with OCD, these worries can take over their lives. The effort of trying
to control them can be very stressful.

OCD usually starts when you're a child, a teenager, or a young adult. There's no single
cause. The genes you inherit from your parents may play a part. OCD may also be caused
by things that happen in your life and the way you think about the world.

What are the symptoms?
There are two sets of symptoms that affect people with obsessive-compulsive disorder.
Obsessions are unwelcome and disturbing thoughts. You may get images or urges that keep coming
into your mind. They're difficult to get rid of. Here are some examples:



Being scared of dirt and germs


Wanting to have things arranged symmetrically


Thinking about performing particular sexual acts.


Compulsions are actions that you feel you have to do to stop the obsessive thoughts. Here are
some common compulsions:



Washing and cleaning all the time


Repeating words or numbers in a pattern


Touching or counting things, often in a particular sequence.


If your symptoms don't interfere too much with your life, your doctor may say you
have mild OCD. If your symptoms are very distressing and stop you getting on with
your everyday life, you may have severe OCD.

Sometimes people with OCD get a problem where they repeat movements, sounds, or words.
These are known as tics. Some people with OCD also have depression.

What treatments work?
The main treatments for obsessive-compulsive disorder are a talking treatment called
cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) and antidepressant drugs.

It's hard to say which of these works best. You may need to try more than one treatment
or combine treatments.

Cognitive behaviour therapy
Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) is a talking treatment (psychotherapy). You work with a therapist to find practical
ways of coping with your OCD. There’s good evidence it can help you have fewer symptoms
of OCD.

CBT looks at your beliefs about the world. Your treatment might include your therapist:


Asking you to think about whether your fears are realistic


Asking you to confront the thing that makes you anxious: for example, touching something
you think is dirty



Helping you cope without any compulsive behaviour, such as washing your hands.


You'll probably be given homework to do between sessions. You'll be asked to put yourself
in situations that make you anxious, and use the techniques you learned to cope with
them. You can have therapy on your own or in a group.

Although CBT can work for adults and children, the treatment makes some people very
anxious. Some people drop out of CBT as a result.

Medicines
Antidepressant medicines, including one type called SSRIs, can help people with OCD.
(SSRI is short for selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor.) These medicines are only
available on prescription from your doctor.

We don't know whether having medicines and CBT together works better than having one
treatment on its own.

But the treatments are often combined for people with severe OCD, or for people who
aren't helped by just one treatment.

All antidepressants can cause side effects in some people, which can include drowsiness,
dry mouth, shaking, constipation, and stomach upsets.

As a result, antidepressants should be used with caution, especially in young people.
CBT is usually the first choice of treatment for children and teenagers.

One side effect of SSRIs is that they might make you think more about suicide when
you first start taking them. The risk is highest for children, teenagers, and young
adults under the age of 25.

If you are taking an antidepressant and are worried about any thoughts or feelings
you have, see your doctor straight away.

If an antidepressant doesn't help or doesn't help enough, your doctor may recommend
combining it with another medicine. For example, an SSRI can be combined with another
antidepressant or with an antipsychotic medicine.

Antipsychotics are usually used to treat mental health problems that cause people
to lose touch with reality, such as schizophrenia, but they can also sometimes help
with OCD.

Antipsychotics can have side effects in some people, including drowsiness, weight
gain, feeling shaky, and feeling sick or dizzy.

What will happen to me?
OCD affects different people in different ways. Some people find their symptoms come
and go. Other people have the symptoms all the time.

If you have very severe OCD you may find it difficult to work or cope with everyday
life. Getting treatment can help."

If you're obese, you weigh much more than is healthy for you. This is the result of
regularly eating more calories than your body uses. The extra calories are stored
as fat.

You can use our information to talk to your doctor and decide which treatments are
best for you.

What is obesity?
Being obese means being very overweight. This can greatly increase your chance of
serious health problems such as diabetes, high blood pressure, arthritis, heart disease,
and some cancers.

Losing weight isn't easy. If changing your diet and exercising aren't helping you
lose enough weight, your doctor might suggest you also take weight loss medicines. And if your weight is putting your health at high risk, your doctor might recommend
having weight loss surgery.

When doctors talk about reaching a 'healthy' weight, they mean getting to a weight
that lowers your risk of these health problems. It's not about how thin you would
like to look.

Most doctors use the body mass index (BMI for short) to work out whether someone is
at a healthy weight. Your BMI is a single number that's calculated based on your height
and your weight.

Doctors say someone is obese if their BMI is 30 or higher. If someone has a BMI of
40 or higher, doctors say the person is extremely obese.

What treatments work?
To lose weight, you need to take in less energy, in the form of food and drinks, than
you use. Many people do this through a weight loss programme that combines:



eating a low-calorie diet. There are many diets you can follow. But research suggests
that low-carbohydrate or low-glycaemic diets might work best.



exercising regularly, and


having behavioural therapy to help them change how they eat and exercise.


Some people also take medicines to help them lose weight. But they still need to follow a low-calorie diet and exercise
regularly. These medicines can also have side effects.

If your weight is putting your health at high risk (for example, if you are extremely
overweight or if you cannot breathe properly) you may need to lose weight quickly
by having surgery. But this is often used as a last resort.

Medicines
There are currently only a few medicines that can be prescribed for weight loss. The
most commonly prescribed one is called orlistat.

Orlistat doesn’t stop you feeling hungry, but it stops your body absorbing some of
the fat from the food you eat. When you take orlistat about one third of the fat you
eat passes straight out of your body in your stools.

Taking orlistat while following a low-calorie diet and exercising regularly can increase
your chance of losing about 5 percent of your body weight over a year.

Most people taking orlistat get some side effects, which may discourage them from
taking the medicine. These include:



an oily leakage from their bowels


diarrhoea that comes on very quickly


frequent wind, and


nausea and vomiting.


You may be able to avoid these side effects by making sure that your meals contain
no more than 30 percent fat. That means that for every 100 grams of food you eat,
not more than 30 grams of it should be fat. Talk to your doctor or a dietitian about
how to do this.

Orlistat can stop you from absorbing vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K, and beta-carotene
(vitamin A). Your doctor may recommend vitamin supplements.

Liraglutide is a medicine that is usually used to treat diabetes. But it is sometimes prescribed
to help people to lose weight. Side effects can include dizziness and an upset stomach

You might have heard of a weight-loss medicine called lorcaserin. This is not used in many countries, including the UK, the US, and the European Union,
because it is not considered safe. Lorcaserin has been linked to increased cancer
risk.

If you have been prescribed lorcaserin, you should talk to your doctor about other
treatments instead.

Weight loss (bariatric) surgery
If you're extremely obese, surgery to make your stomach smaller can help you eat less
and lose weight. This is called weight loss surgery, or bariatric surgery.

Weight loss surgery is a major operation. Your doctor will need to make sure you meet
certain requirements before considering surgery.

Surgery is usually done only if your weight is dangerous to your health, and if you've
tried other ways of losing weight. You need to follow a strict diet after the operation.


There are several types of weight loss surgery. The main ones are:


gastric bypass: The surgeon staples a small pouch in the top of your stomach. Your small bowel is
cut away from the lower part of your stomach, shortened, and reattached to the pouch.
The rest of your stomach is closed off



gastric banding: An adjustable band makes a small pouch in the top part of your stomach



biliopancreatic diversion: The bottom part of your stomach is removed so your stomach is smaller. Your small
bowel is shortened and reattached to the stomach



sleeve gastrectomy: This operation closes off three-quarters of the stomach, leaving a narrow tube.



People can lose a lot of weight after weight loss surgery, with some losing between
40 percent and 100 percent of their excess body weight. People with type 2 diabetes
or high blood pressure sometimes find that these conditions greatly improve after
they've had surgery.

The amount of weight you lose depends on what you eat and how much exercise you do
after surgery. Surgery doesn't work for everyone. Some people don't lose any weight,
or put most of it back on.

You will have to change how you eat after surgery, as you will only be able to eat
a small amount before your stomach is full. Some people have problems with their digestion,
including nausea, diarrhoea, constipation, indigestion, and heartburn. You may also
need to take supplements to make sure you get all the vitamins you need.

Some people get problems from surgery, such as infections, bleeding, and pneumonia.
Being treated by an experienced surgeon, and in a hospital where surgeons do lots
of operations for obesity, reduces the chance of problems.

There's a small chance that you will die during surgery or shortly afterwards. About
three in every 1000 people die during surgery or in the following month.

To reduce your chance of problems during and after surgery, you may need to lose some
weight before your operation. It's also best to give up smoking before surgery.

What will happen to me?
If you're obese, the benefits of losing weight are many. You will feel better and
have a much lower chance of serious health problems, including heart disease, cancer,
diabetes, and arthritis. Losing weight can be difficult, but medicines or surgery
can help some people."

regularly eating more calories than your body uses. Your body stores the extra calories
as fat.

Losing weight isn't easy. You'll need to change the way you eat and the amount of
exercise you get. But if you make these changes you'll feel better and reduce your
chance of many serious health problems.

You can use our information to talk with your doctor about which approach to weight
loss is best for you.

What is obesity?
Being obese means being very overweight. This can greatly increase your chances of
serious health problems such as:



diabetes


high blood pressure


arthritis


cancer, and


heart disease.


When doctors talk about reaching a 'healthy' weight, they mean getting to a weight
that lowers your risk of these health problems. It's not based on how thin you would
like to look.

Most doctors use the body mass index (BMI for short) to work out whether you're at
a healthy weight. Your BMI is a single number that's calculated based on your height
and your weight. Doctors say someone is obese if their BMI is 30 or higher.

You might think that you don't eat a lot and that your weight problems must be caused
by something else, such as a slow metabolism. But you can only become obese by eating
more calories than your body uses. Unfortunately, to put on weight, you only have
to eat slightly more calories than you use.

What are the symptoms?
If you are obese, you carry a lot of extra weight on your body. Carrying this extra
weight may make you feel tired, or short of breath, or make your joints ache. You
may also get skin irritation where your skin folds. Women may find that their periods
become irregular.

Having extra weight around your waist has also been linked to having a higher chance
of problems with your blood sugar, blood pressure, or cholesterol. This in turn may
increase your chance of having heart problems.

What treatments work?
To lose weight, you need to take in fewer calories each day than you use. You can
do this by following a weight loss programme.

Doctors usually recommend that people lose about 10 percent of their body weight over
the first six months. If your BMI is 30 to 35, this will mean losing between 0.25
and 0.5 kilograms each week. If your BMI is above 35, you may need to lose between
0.5 kilograms and 1 kilogram a week.

Work with your doctor or practice nurse to set short-term, realistic goals.
Weight loss programmes
You have the best chance of losing weight if you combine a low-calorie diet with an
exercise programme and behavioural therapy to help change the way you eat and exercise.



A low-calorie diet means you eat fewer calories. This could mean eating smaller portions, and choosing
foods with fewer calories. Men are usually advised to eat around 1200 to 1500 calories
a day to lose weight. For women, the goal is usually 1000 to 1200 calories.

There are many types of diet you can follow to lose weight, including low-fat diets,
low-carbohydrate diets (such as the Atkins diet), the Mediterranean diet, and supervised
diet plans (such as Weight Watchers).

Some research suggests that low-carbohydrate diets work better than low-fat diets
for the first six months, and that people find them easier to stick to. But there
isn't much good evidence about what works best over the long term.



Exercise is another essential part of a weight loss programme. The more exercise you do, the
more calories you use. You'll probably need to do at least 30 minutes of physical
activity on most days.

If you don't currently exercise, it's a good idea to start slowly and work up to this
amount. Your doctor can provide advice on how much exercise you should do. Bear in
mind that exercise alone won't help you to lose much weight. You need to cut calories,
too.



Behavioural therapy includes ways to help you change the way you eat and your exercise habits. You have
sessions with a health professional to learn to think and act differently so that
you can stick to your weight loss programme.



Research suggests that you're more likely to lose weight and keep the weight off if
your weight loss programme includes:



regular contact with a health professional


support from other people who are losing weight


a low-calorie diet that lists the kinds of foods to eat and those to avoid


weighing yourself regularly


a personalised exercise plan


a plan for how best to keep weight off when you've reached your target weight.


Home videos or self-help books probably won’t help as much as meeting regularly with
a health professional to talk through your progress.

It's better to lose weight slowly and keep up the changes to your lifestyle. Crash
diets or one-time bursts of exercise don't help to control your weight in the long
term. The longer your weight loss programme lasts, the more likely you are to keep
the weight off.

What will happen to me?
If you're obese, losing weight and keeping the weight off can be difficult. It will
probably be easier if you get help from your doctor and follow a weight loss programme.

Here's what we know happens to most people who follow a weight loss programme:


Most people lose about 5 percent to 10 percent of their weight within six months if
they follow a programme that includes diet and exercise.



Keeping the weight off can be a struggle. Most people put back on at least some of
the weight they lose.



Your best chance of keeping the weight off is to stay in a weight loss programme,
with regular support from a health professional.



Although losing weight can be a challenge, the benefits are many. You will feel better
and also have a much lower chance of serious health problems, including heart disease,
cancer, diabetes, and arthritis."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1536440750346/Nosebleeds%20in%20children,Nosebleeds in children,"Nosebleeds in children Last published: Apr 25, 2022
Most children get nosebleeds from time to time. If your child gets them a lot, you
may be worried that there's something wrong. Most likely, there isn't. Children usually
grow out of nosebleeds by the time they are teenagers.
What are nosebleeds?
The blood vessels in a child's nose can bleed easily. Your child might get a nosebleed
after tripping, being hit in the face during sport or play, or falling off a bike.
If your child’s nose bleeds after an injury, see a doctor straight away. The doctor
will check whether your child has broken their nose, or if they have any other injuries
that need treating.

Some children get nosebleeds a lot, especially if they pick their nose, get an object
stuck in their nose, or have an infection. If you often use nasal drops or sprays
to treat an allergy, such as hay fever, this may also cause nosebleeds. Some nosebleeds
happen for no obvious reason.

Very rarely, nosebleeds are caused by a problem with the structure of a child’s nose,
or by a benign growth (a growth that isn't cancer). It's extremely unusual for nosebleeds
to be a sign of a serious disease, such as cancer or a bleeding problem.

What treatments work?
Most nosebleeds can be easily treated at home with simple first aid. If you’re worried
that your child gets a lot of nosebleeds, you may want to take them to see a doctor.
Your doctor will look for anything that may be causing the nosebleeds and talk about
whether your child needs treatment to prevent them.

First aid you can do yourself
Nosebleeds are not usually difficult to stop. Stay calm and reassure your child. Sit
them down and ask them to lean forward. Don’t have your child lie down or hold their
head back, because blood might drip down their throat and make them sick.

Gently squeeze, or get your child to squeeze, the soft part of their nose, near the
nostrils. (Squeezing the bony part of their nose, nearer the top, won't help.) Keep
squeezing for five minutes, then check whether the bleeding has stopped. If it hasn’t
stopped, squeeze for another 10 minutes. Don't put anything into your child's nose,
such as tissues or cotton gauze.

Take your child to hospital or to see a doctor if the bleeding is heavy, it doesn't
stop after 15 or 20 minutes, or it was caused by an accident.

Doctor treatment for a nosebleed that won't stop
If the nosebleed has not stopped by pressing on the nose, the doctor may use a spray
that combines a local anaesthetic and a drug to narrow the blood vessels, or dab the
mixture on with cotton. They will check whether there is any other cause for the bleeding,
such as something stuck in the nose.

If this treatment does not stop the bleeding, the doctor may pack the nostril with
cotton or sponge. Or they may seal off the blood vessels using a chemical called silver
nitrate. This is called cauterisation. Both packing and cauterisation can be uncomfortable.

Preventing nosebleeds: things you can do yourself
Tell your child not to pick their nose, as this can cause bleeding. They should also
avoid injury to their nose, for example from falling over or while playing sport.

Some people try coating the inside of the child's nostrils with petroleum jelly (Vaseline).


Preventing nosebleeds: things the doctor can do
Your doctor may suggest you use an antiseptic and antibiotic cream inside your child's
nose.

They may also suggest cauterisation to seal off blood vessels to prevent future bleeding.


There is not much evidence to show how well either antiseptic creams or cauterisation
work, or which is best.

What will happen?
Nosebleeds can be unpleasant, especially if they happen a lot. But they can usually
be stopped easily. Most children stop having frequent nosebleeds by the time they’re
teenagers."

Bleeding from the nose is more common in children than in adults, but it happens to
people of all ages.

You can usually stop a nosebleed by yourself, but some people need medical treatment.
If you have problems with nosebleeds, you can use our information to talk with your
doctor about the best treatments for you.

What is epistaxis?
Epistaxis is the medical name for bleeding from the nose or from the area between
the nostrils and the back of the throat, called the nasopharynx.

Many things can cause this type of bleeding. They include:


dry weather, or dry air in a building, which can cause the skin inside the nose to
dry out and crack



an injury to the nose, or a broken nose


some medicines, such as those that thin your blood


inflammation (swelling) inside the nose


picking your nose, and


blowing your nose hard.


Symptoms and diagnosis
Most people will have a nosebleed at some point in their life. But if you have severe bleeding, or if you have regular nosebleeds, you may need medical treatment.

If you need to see a doctor about severe or repeated nosebleeds, he or she will ask
you questions to try to find out why it might be happening. For example, your doctor
will probably ask about:



how often you have nosebleeds and how bad they are


what medicines or supplements you are taking


any other medical conditions you have


whether anyone else in your family has nosebleeds


how much alcohol you drink. Alcohol can thin your blood so that it doesn’t clot as
easily. This can make a nosebleed last longer.



Your doctor will also want to examine you. For example, he or she may shine a light
into your nose, and clean out your nose in order to see any problems more clearly.

Your doctor may also suggest a blood test, or a test of how quickly your blood is
able to clot.

What treatments are available?
Stopping a nosebleed yourself
You can usually stop a nosebleed within 10 or 15 minutes, like this:


sit down and lean forward, with your head tilted slightly forward


pinch your nose closed just above your nostrils and below the bone


breathe through your mouth while you do this.


You can also try holding an ice pack wrapped in cloth to the top of your nose. This may help to make the blood vessels
close up (constrict).

Medical treatment for a nosebleed
If you have medical treatment for a nosebleed, it will probably involve cautery. This means applying a chemical to the broken skin in your nose to stop it bleeding.

If your doctor thinks that the bleeding can be stopped without cautery, he or she
may just pack your nose with cotton to block up the wound.

Your doctor might also apply a cream to the inside of your nose that helps to make
the blood vessels tighten up so that you bleed less.

If you are in pain your doctor may prescribe a painkiller. But the medicine you can have will depend on what has caused your nosebleed, and
on any other medical conditions you may have.

For example, you should not take aspirin if you are having severe bleeding, as aspirin slows down blood clotting and can make
bleeding worse.

Your doctor might also advise you not to take non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, as these can have the same effect.

After stopping your bleeding, your doctor will want to find out what has caused it,
to help prevent it happening again.

For example, if your bleeding is linked to another medical condition, your doctor
may take steps to help treat that condition, if it’s not being treated already.

If your bleeding is linked to any medication you are taking, your doctor may be able
to suggest changes to your medication or to the dose, to help you stop having problems
with bleeding.

Your doctor might also refer you to an ENT (ear, nose, and throat) specialist.

Preventing more nosebleeds
There are things you can do to prevent more nosebleeds.
In the short term, for a few days after a severe nosebleed you should take care not to:



pick or blow your nose


take aspirin or ibuprofen


drink hot drinks or alcohol, and


do anything strenuous.


In the longer term, if you have regular nosebleeds, it might help to do things like:



use a humidifier in your home, to stop the air from becoming too dry


avoid taking aspirin if possible


using petroleum jelly or a similar nasal moisturiser, to stop the skin on the inside
of your nose from drying and cracking.



What to expect in the future
Most people who need medical treatment for nosebleeds or injuries to the nose don’t
have long-term problems that need more treatment.

Some people have complications linked to very severe bleeding or to other medical
conditions. If this applies to you, your doctor will discuss any actions that might
help, and he or she might refer you to a specialist."

It’s worrying to learn that you have any type of cancer. But there are good treatments
for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, which can often lead to a cure.

Here, we look at the most common type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, called diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. You can use our information to talk to your doctor and decide which treatments are
best for you.

What is non-Hodgkin's lymphoma?
Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects cells in your immune system.
When your body's cells are healthy, they divide, grow, and are replaced in an orderly
way. When cells become cancerous, they grow too fast and do not develop properly.
Abnormal cells form a lump called a tumour, which gets bigger over time.



Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma starts in cells called lymphocytes, which help your body fight infection. Tumours made of lymphocytes are called lymphomas.



Lymphomas most often develop in lymph nodes, which are small collections of lymphocytes that occur naturally throughout your
body. You may also hear them called lymph glands.





If the affected lymph node is close to the skin (such as those in your neck, armpit,
or groin), you may feel a lump. But lymphomas can also grow in lymph nodes deep inside
your body where you can't feel them, such as the lymph nodes in your chest and abdomen.




Lymphomas can also sometimes grow outside your lymph nodes. For example, they can
grow in your stomach, bowels, and brain.



Your doctor might discuss with you what 'stage' your cancer is at. This means how
far your cancer has spread. For example, stage 1 and 2 cancers might only be in a
small area, while stage 3 and 4 cancers are likely to have spread further. Later-stage
cancers are harder to treat.

We don't know why some people get non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. However, we do know that
it's more common in:



people over the age of 50


people who have a parent or sibling who had this cancer


people who have problems with their immune system (for example, in people with HIV,
or in people who have had an organ transplant).



There are more than 30 types of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The information here is for
adults with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. If you are unsure what type of lymphoma you have, ask your doctor.

What are the symptoms?
The most common symptom is being able to feel one or more lumps in your neck, armpit,
groin, or abdomen, or in your testicles if you're a man.

Some lumps get very big and grow fast, but others grow more slowly.
Some people get more general symptoms. These include:


feeling very tired


having a fever that makes you sweat badly at night


losing your appetite, and


losing weight.


Lymphomas can also cause other symptoms depending on where they grow. For example:


if a lymphoma blocks your bowel, this can cause pain, nausea, and vomiting


a lymphoma in the lungs can cause difficulty breathing


if a lymphoma develops in your brain, you could get seizures or become forgetful and
confused.



Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is not easy to diagnose from symptoms alone. To know for certain
that you have this cancer, you will need to have a biopsy.

This is where a surgeon removes a piece of tissue from the affected area to test it
for cancer cells. People often have a lymph node (or part of a lymph node) removed
for testing.

What treatments work?
Chemotherapy is the main treatment for diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
It is usually given along with a drug called rituximab. You might also have radiotherapy.


You will be treated by a specialist cancer doctor.
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill cancer cells. The type of chemotherapy most often
used for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is a combination of drugs, called CHOP. It is a combination of four drugs.

Many people have a slightly different treatment called R-CHOP, which includes a fifth drug.

You have chemotherapy in cycles. For each cycle you will have treatment, followed
by a rest period with no R-CHOP or CHOP treatment.

Each cycle usually lasts 21 days. You will probably have three to eight cycles. The
exact number and duration of these cycles will depend on the nature of your cancer
and what other treatments you have (for example, you may have fewer cycles if you
also have radiotherapy).

Chemotherapy will probably shrink your tumour and can cure it. Even if your cancer
does not go away completely, chemotherapy can help you live longer.

You are likely to get some temporary side effects from these treatments, but you probably
won't get all of them. The most common side effects from chemotherapy include



losing some or all of your hair


nausea and vomiting


feeling tired


having low levels of blood cells that help fight infections, and


and having discomfort when you pass urine.


Most of these side effects can be treated.
It's important that you tell your doctor if you have symptoms of a possible infection,
such as a fever, chills, stomach pain, pain when urinating, or a cough.

Chemotherapy can also sometimes cause bleeding. You should let your doctor know if
you have black stools (which suggests there is blood in your stools), or bleeding
from your rectum, nose, gums, or (if you are a woman) vagina.

Additional medicines
Sometimes doctors recommend taking other medicines along with R-CHOP. These are usually
offered to prevent possible problems either from your cancer or from the chemotherapy.
Not everyone will need these treatments. You and your doctor will discuss what's right
for you.



Most people treated with CHOP will also have a treatment called a growth factor. CHOP kills cancer cells, but it also kills some of your normal cells that help fight
infections. Growth factors help your body to make more of these cells.



If you end up very low on cells that fight infections, your doctor may recommend taking
antibiotics for a while to help prevent infections caused by bacteria.



Your doctor may also recommend other treatments, including medicines to lower the
chance of lymphoma coming back in your brain and spinal cord.



Radiotherapy
Sometimes people have radiotherapy after chemotherapy for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
Your doctor may recommend this treatment if:



you have lymphoma in a single area


the lymphoma is large, or


some lymphoma may still be remaining at the end of chemotherapy.


Radiotherapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill cancer cells. Each treatment lasts only
a few minutes, and you won't feel anything during treatment. Most people need treatment
five days a week for several weeks.

Adding radiotherapy to chemotherapy may help get rid of your lymphoma and help you
live longer than having chemotherapy alone. But not everyone needs radiotherapy.

Radiotherapy can damage normal cells as well as cancer cells. So doctors are careful
to aim the radiation directly at your tumour.

The most common short-term side effects include having itchy skin where you have been
treated, and feeling tired.

Radiotherapy can also sometimes cause long-term problems. But these aren't common
and they depend on the part of your body treated. Your doctor will discuss possible
side effects with you.

What will happen to me?
Cancer affects every person differently. Your cancer specialist or cancer nurse is
the best person to talk to about your future outlook.

About 80 in 100 people whose non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is diagnosed at an early stage
can be cured. Cancers diagnosed at late stages can still be cured, but they are harder
to treat.

Your doctor or nurse may use the word ‘remission’. Being in remission means that treatment
has worked and doctors can no longer detect your cancer. You can think of yourself
as cured when you have been in remission for five years.

Like many other cancers, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma can come back after it's been treated.
When a cancer comes back it's called having a relapse.

No-one can tell you for certain if your lymphoma will come back. But it is rare for
non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma to relapse after two years.

If your cancer does come back, you can have more treatment. You may need a different
type of chemotherapy, or more intense chemotherapy.

You might also need a stem cell or bone marrow transplant, which can help your body
recover from intense chemotherapy. Many people who have a relapse can still be cured."

https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/3000271/Neuroleptic%20malignant%20syndrome,Neuroleptic malignant syndrome,"Neuroleptic malignant syndrome Last published: Jan 30, 2023
Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is a bad reaction triggered by certain medicines. The
medicines are usually those used to control mental-health conditions such as schizophrenia.

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a medical emergency that can cause death.
If you or someone you know is taking the medicines discussed here, and develops symptoms
of NMS, get medical help straight away.

What is neuroleptic malignant syndrome?
Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a medical emergency that can be fatal. If you recognise the symptoms in yourself or someone that you
know, get medical help immediately.

NMS is caused by a bad reaction to certain medicines. The most common cause of NMS
is a reaction to medicines called antipsychotics. You might also hear these drugs called dopamine antagonists.

Dopamine
Dopamine is a substance made in the brain. It is crucial to how our nervous system works.
Dopamine has many jobs in the body. For example, it plays a large part in how we:



send messages around the nervous system. For this reason it’s called a neurotransmitter


feel pleasure and happiness


plan and think ahead


get enough sleep, and


control feelings of nausea.


Too much or too little dopamine can cause serious problems. For example, NMS happens
when someone’s dopamine levels are too low.

Antipsychotics (dopamine antagonists) can sometimes cause this to happen. These drugs treat conditions such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder by reducing the amount of dopamine in the body.

In people with these conditions, too much dopamine can lead to psychosis. Symptoms of psychosis can include hallucinations (seeing things that aren’t there)
and personality changes.

But if antipsychotic drugs reduce the amount of dopamine in the body by too much,
it can cause NMS.

Other medications and neuroleptic malignant syndrome
People taking medicines other than antipsychotics can sometimes have episodes of NMS.
The most common ones are called dopamine agonists.

Although their names are similar and easily confused, these drugs are very different.
Dopamine agonists do the opposite of dopamine antagonists.

They are used to treat conditions where people don’t produce enough dopamine. They
work either by increasing the amount of dopamine in the body, or by fooling the body
into thinking that it has more dopamine than it does.

For example, they are an important treatment for Parkinson’s disease.

NMS can affect someone with Parkinson’s disease if:


their dose of medicine is reduced too quickly, or


they have suddenly stopped taking their medicine.


If you or someone you are caring for is taking either dopamine agonists or dopamine
antagonists (antipsychotics), your doctor should carefully explain what NMS is, and
what to do if you see the signs of it.

What are the symptoms?
The main symptoms of NMS are the same whether they are linked to dopamine agonists
or dopamine antagonists. They are:



a fever


stiffening of the muscles


agitation, confusion, and other changes in someone’s mental state


increased heart rate, and


fast breathing.


With dopamine antagonists (antipsychotics), symptoms usually start soon after someone
starts treatment.

If you notice these symptoms within three days of taking one of these drugs, get medical help straight away. NMS is a medical emergency that can cause death.

With dopamine agonists, these symptoms can happen if someone (usually someone with
Parkinson’s disease) either stops taking their medicine, or reduces their dose too
quickly.

Again, if you notice these symptoms in someone with Parkinson’s disease who is taking
a dopamine agonist, get medical help straight away.

If you see a doctor who thinks that you might have NMS you will probably need to have
some tests to find out. These might include:



blood tests


an electrocardiogram (ECG) to check your heart rhythm, and


scans.


The doctor will also ask you (or someone with you, if you cannot communicate clearly
for any reason) for a list of all the medicines you are taking. This helps to quickly
find out which drug has caused the problem.

What treatments are available?
This leaflet covers emergency treatment for NMS. But if you have an episode of NMS
you will also need longer-term treatment to assess the ongoing drug treatment you
need.

The aims of emergency treatment are to:



restore dopamine to the right level in the body as quickly as possible, and


treat the symptoms caused by NMS.


For NMS caused by antipsychotics (dopamine antagonists), restoring your dopamine level means stopping the drug so that dopamine levels increase.

For NMS caused by dopamine agonists (usually in people with Parkinson’s disease), this means restarting the drug or increasing
the dose so that dopamine levels increase.

To treat the symptoms of NMS, the treatments you need might include:


fluids to deal with dehydration. You might be able to take these by mouth. But some
people need to be given fluids directly into a vein



cooling you to get your temperature down. This might be done with fans or ice packs.
Medicines that usually cool people when they have a fever, such as paracetamol, don’t
work for NMS



sedative medicine to calm you and relax your stiff muscles. Relaxing your muscles
helps you to breathe and swallow



making sure you can get enough nutrition while you recover. If you are having problems
swallowing, or if you are not conscious, this might mean having a feeding tube inserted
through your nose, and



oxygen if your stiff muscles are affecting your breathing.


What to expect in the future
When you have recovered, your doctor will assess what medicine you need to start taking
to keep you stable.

For example, if you need to start taking an antipsychotic (dopamine antagonist) again,
it probably won’t be for a couple of weeks, just to let your body settle down. And
it should usually be a different drug from the one that caused the problem.

Most people recover well from an episode of NMS. But about 8 or 9 in every 100 people
die from it.

Some people have more than one episode of NMS. This is thought to happen to about
30 in 100 people who take medicines that can cause NMS.

NMS can’t always be prevented. But being aware of the symptoms and getting help quickly
when it happens give you the best chance of recovering."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/3000189/Nasopharyngeal%20airway%20%28breathing%20tube%20in%20the%20nose%29,Nasopharyngeal airway (breathing tube in the nose),"Nasopharyngeal airway (breathing tube in the nose) Last published: Mar 14, 2022
Having a breathing tube placed through the nose is one of several procedures that
can help people who are having trouble breathing normally.

It’s often used when other methods might be difficult. For example, this method can
work well when someone is awake or partly awake, and might not react well to a breathing
tube being placed through the mouth.

What is a nasopharyngeal airway?
There are two ways for air to reach your voice box (larynx), your windpipe (trachea),
and then your lungs: through the mouth, or through the nose. When we breathe, we use
a combination of both.

The pharynx is the space behind the nose and mouth that connects your nose to your larynx. When
you have a nasopharyngeal airway, it just means that a tube is passed through the
nose and pharynx on the way to the larynx.

Why might I need a nasopharyngeal airway?
This procedure is one of several that can be used to help people who are having trouble
breathing normally: for example, if they have been in an accident and lost consciousness
(blacked out). It’s used until someone can breathe normally again on their own.

This particular procedure is often used when someone is awake or partly awake. When
someone is awake it is harder to place a breathing tube through the mouth.

This method is also often used if medics have tried and failed to place a breathing
tube in the mouth.

What will happen?
The first thing that will happen if you have this procedure is that the medic will
give you some oxygen through a simple mask, just to make sure you get some oxygen
before the procedure begins.

As you are lying on your back, the mask fits loosely over your face. The medic will
squeeze gently on a flexible bag that is supplied with oxygen. The oxygen is then
pushed gently into your nose and mouth. The medic will then:



remove the mask




move your head gently back into a position that opens the airway




ease the flexible, lubricated tube into your nostril and back through the pharynx
until it is in position. A small widened neck, or flange, stops the tube at the right
place, so that it doesn’t go all the way into your nose





replace the oxygen mask and squeeze the bag supplying the oxygen regularly, so that
oxygen passes through the tube in your nose, and into your lungs.



What are the risks?
All emergency breathing procedures carry risks. The main thing that can go wrong with
this method is that the tube can damage the inside of the nose. This is not usually
serious.

What can I expect afterwards?
The airway is kept in place until you can breathe by yourself. After it is removed,
the medic treating you will keep a close eye on you to check that your breathing is
now steady and regular. You can be given more oxygen if you need it."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/3000055/Myasthenia%20gravis,Myasthenia gravis,"Myasthenia gravis Last published: Aug 06, 2021
Myasthenia gravis causes weakness in many of the body’s muscles, including those that
control breathing, speaking, and movement. It is a long-term condition with no cure.
But there are treatments that can help relieve the symptoms.
What is myasthenia gravis?
Myasthenia gravis is a rare, long-term condition that is caused by the genes you inherit
from your parents. It’s also what’s called an autoimmune condition. This means that
the body’s immune system isn’t working properly.

The immune system normally makes antibodies that fight infections and protect us from
them. But in people with myasthenia gravis, the immune system makes antibodies that
attack some of the body’s own tissues.

This causes weakness in many of the body’s muscles. This weakness gets worse the more
active you are, and it improves after you rest for a while.

The muscles that are most commonly affected are the ones that control the eyes and
face, and those that help us to swallow and chew. But any muscles can be affected,
including those that help us to breathe.

Myasthenia gravis affects both men and women, but at different ages. It tends to affect
men in the middle or later years of life, while in women it appears much earlier.


What are the symptoms?
The main symptom of myasthenia gravis is weakness in some of the muscles. This means
that those muscles will get tired very quickly and might not be able to function normally
without frequent rest.

People with myasthenia gravis tend to be affected in one of three different ways.


Weakness in the muscles around the eyes. This can cause drooping eyelids and difficulty
controlling facial expressions.



Weakness in the muscles in the mouth and throat. This can also make it hard to speak,
chew, and swallow. It can also make it hard to control facial expressions.



More general muscle weakness in other areas of the body. This can cause weakness in
a particular limb, and problems with breathing.



Doctors can often diagnose myasthenia gravis just by asking you about your symptoms
and examining you. There are also tests that can help with an accurate diagnosis.


A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest can spot problems with a small gland
in the chest called the thymus. The thymus plays a part in the immune system. Most
people with myasthenia gravis will have an enlarged thymus.

Other tests that help with diagnosing myasthenia gravis include blood tests and tests
of your nervous system.

About 15 in 100 people with myasthenia gravis will have what’s called a thymoma. This
is a type of cancer where a tumour develops on the thymus.

Thymomas can usually be successfully surgically removed. This removes the cancer,
but it does not cure myasthenia gravis. So you will probably still need treatment.


Your doctor might also check how well your lungs are working. This can help to tell
how likely you are to have what’s called a myasthenic crisis at some point. This is when the muscles temporarily become so weak that breathing
becomes difficult.

If you have a myasthenic crisis you need urgent medical treatment to help you breathe.
Your doctor should discuss with you how to spot the symptoms and what to do if it
happens.

What treatments work?
The treatment for myasthenia gravis depends on how serious your symptoms are. With
the right care, most people with the condition live normal lives. People with mild
symptoms that don’t happen often usually don’t need any treatment at all.

Surgery
If your symptoms are mild but happen quite often, there are several treatments that
can help. Most people with myasthenia gravis do better after an operation called a
thymectomy.

This is surgery to remove the thymus, the small gland in the chest that can make myasthenia
gravis worse when it doesn’t work properly. In people with myasthenia gravis, the
thymus is usually larger than normal.

Removing the thymus is a helpful treatment even if there is no thymoma (cancer). So
it’s recommended for most people with myasthenia gravis.

Most people’s symptoms are less severe after thymectomy. But you might not feel the
full benefit for several months or even years after the operation.

Medicines
If you have regular mild symptoms, your doctor will probably suggest you take medicines
to help control them. These might include:



cholinesterase inhibitors. These drugs help your muscles to work.


steroids (the full name is corticosteroids). These drugs are used to reduce inflammation
(swelling). They are especially helpful in people whose eyes are affected by myasthenia
gravis.



All medicines can cause side effects in some people. Your doctor should discuss these
with you. If you get side effects, tell your doctor. You might be able to change to
a different medicine.

Treatments for severe symptoms
If your symptoms are severe, your doctor might suggest other treatments.
Plasma exchange is a treatment where your blood is filtered through a machine that removes the antibodies
that are attacking your immune system.

This treatment is often used for people who have severe symptoms and need treatment
in hospital. You start to feel the benefits very quickly, but they only last for a
few weeks.

IVIG. This stands for intravenous immunoglobulin. It helps your immune system to function normally. Like plasma exchange, it is often
used as a short-term treatment in emergencies.

Other medicines that can help some people include drugs called monoclonal antibodies. This is a longer-term treatment that works by changing the way the immune system
works.

What will happen?
Myasthenia gravis doesn’t usually affect how long people live, and most people with
the condition live normal lives.

Whatever treatment you have, you should have regular check-ups in a neurology clinic,
with a doctor who specialises in conditions that affect the nervous system (a neurologist).


You will need to see the neurologist more or less often, depending on how severe your
symptoms are.

Your doctor will ask about your symptoms: for example, he or she might ask whether
you have any trouble swallowing or breathing. Your doctor will also ask whether you
are having any side effects from your medicines.

Many people find that they get much better with treatment, although this can take
years.

You might also have periods when your symptoms get worse temporarily. This can be
caused by many things, such as infections. If you feel yourself getting suddenly worse,
get medical help straight away. This can often stop your symptoms getting too bad."

It can be frightening to find out you have multiple sclerosis (MS). But there are
treatments that can help relieve your symptoms, slow down the illness, and help you
keep getting the most out of life.

You can use our information to talk with your doctor and decide which treatments are
right for you.

What is it?
Multiple sclerosis is an illness that affects your nerves. Nerves carry messages between
your brain and the rest of your body. These nerves have a protective coating made
out of a substance called myelin.

If you have multiple sclerosis, this myelin coating gets damaged in places. This stops
the nerves working as well as they should.

What are the symptoms?
Some people with MS are hardly affected at all. But for others it causes serious disability.
For many people, the first symptoms they get affect their vision. For example, you could get blurred or double vision, or you might see colours less
clearly.

Vision problems can come and go, but the good news is that your vision will probably
go back to normal.

The most common longer-term symptoms are feeling very tired and getting numbness or tingling in parts of your body. The other symptoms you get will depend on which nerves have
been damaged.

There are many possible symptoms of MS, but many people only get a few of them. Here
are some of them:



If the nerves that carry signals to your arms and legs get damaged, you may not be
able to move as easily. Or your arms or legs may shake while you move. Some people
get muscle spasms or twitches, or find that their muscles go stiff.



You may get bladder or bowel problems, such as needing to go to the toilet urgently
or not being able to control when you go.



Some people get dizziness and have problems with balance.


Your memory can be affected, or you may find it harder to concentrate.


Some people have sexual problems, such as erection problems in men or a dry vagina
in women.



Different types of MS
You may not have symptoms all the time. It depends on what type of MS you have. About
85 in 100 people with MS get what's called relapsing-remitting MS at first.

This means that you get flare-ups of symptoms that last for a few days or weeks. A
flare-up of symptoms is called a relapse. But after each relapse your symptoms go away completely. This is called remission.

You may stay in remission for months or even years. However, over the years, you may
find some of your symptoms don't go away completely after each relapse. They stay
with you and may start to get worse over time.

When this happens it's called secondary progressive MS. Almost everyone with the relapsing-remitting type goes on to have secondary progressive
MS within 25 years.

A less common type of MS is called primary progressive MS. If you have this type, your symptoms never really go away from the start. Instead
they get slowly worse. But they may stay the same or get slightly better at times.

The rarest type of MS is called progressive relapsing MS. Your symptoms steadily get worse from the start. On top of that, you also get
relapses, when your symptoms suddenly get much worse.

The symptoms of MS can sound very frightening. But you're unlikely to get all of these
symptoms, and usually you'll have just a few at a time. You don't have to just put
up with your symptoms. A lot can be done to help you feel better.

What treatments are available?
There isn't a treatment that can completely cure MS. But treatments can:


improve your symptoms


slow down the illness, and


help you keep living a full life.


Doctors can't say for certain what course your MS will take, so it's hard to know
what treatments you'll need.

A lot depends on which type of MS you have. You'll probably need different treatments
for MS over time.

Treatments to reduce relapses and disability
If you have relapsing-remitting MS, several drugs can slow down the damage to your
nerves.

This means you'll hopefully have fewer attacks of symptoms. And, by taking these drugs,
you may slow your MS from going on to become secondary progressive MS.

Because these drugs can slow down the course of your illness, they're sometimes called
disease-modifying drugs.

These drugs include medications called immunomodulators. They can help you have fewer relapses and less disability. They're given as injections.

There are other drugs that are used less often, and usually only for people whose
symptoms haven't improved enough with other drugs.

Newer drugs have also become available in recent years as treatments for MS have improved.
For example, you might have heard of medications called monoclonal antibodies. You can ask your doctor if these newer treatments might be suitable for you.

Treatments for MS can cause unpleasant side effects. Your doctor should explain these to you, and you should feel free to ask about them,
and to mention any side effects you have noticed. If side effects bother you a lot,
you might be able to change to a different treatment.

You might need to have regular tests, such as blood tests, to make sure that your
treatment isn't harming you.

Treating symptoms during a relapse
Whatever type of MS you have, your doctor may give you drugs called corticosteroids
for a short time during a relapse.

Corticosteroids help to reduce inflammation (swelling), which can help your nerves
to work better and give some relief from your symptoms.

Treating other symptoms
Some of your symptoms might not clear up with some of the drugs mentioned above, especially
if you have primary or secondary progressive MS. These include:



fatigue (feeling very tired)


muscle spasms


bowel or bladder problems, and


sexual problems.


But your doctor might be able to prescribe other drugs to help with these problems.
You can also try a rehabilitation programme. During these programmes a team of specialists checks your symptoms and works out
what you need to help you cope. For example, you might get physiotherapy to improve your balance, strength, and ability to move.

Many doctors also recommend changes to your lifestyle, such as making sure you get
plenty of sleep, and not eating too much salt.

It's also becoming clear that exercise is very important for people with MS. For example, it helps to:



improve muscle control


improve balance, and


prevent diabetes and too much weight gain, both of which can make MS symptoms worse.


What to expect in the future
It's hard to say how MS will affect you. It affects people in different ways. And
a lot depends on the type of MS you have.

In general, the longer you have MS, the more symptoms you're likely to have. You may
start to need more help getting around. But don't assume that you'll need a wheelchair.

Many people with MS can walk unaided. Others can walk short distances, but need walking
aids and perhaps a motorised chair or scooter to help them with longer trips. Some
people with MS still have very little disability even after 15 to 20 years.

More and more people with MS are now taking drugs to reduce flare-ups and slow the
illness. These drugs are fairly new, so people with MS may do better now than they
would have done in the past.

MS doesn't affect people's length of life by very much. You'll probably live pretty
much as long with MS as you would if you didn't have the condition.

Where to get more help and support
MS is a serious condition and it's important to get all the help and support that's
available. Many people find it useful to talk to other people with MS. You could ask
your doctor about what's available in your area.

There are various charities and support groups that help people with MS. For example,
in the UK the Multiple Sclerosis Society is a charity that offers advice and support
for people with MS (http://www.mssociety.org.uk)."

It can be devastating to be diagnosed with a cancer like multiple myeloma. But there
are treatments that can help you live longer and feel better.

What is multiple myeloma?
Multiple myeloma is a type of cancer that affects the blood. It’s often just called
myeloma. The ‘multiple’ bit means that it can affect lots of parts of your body.

It’s a very individual disease that affects everyone differently. Many people who
have it don’t have symptoms for years. Others get symptoms straight away.

New blood cells are made in the middle of your bones, in a substance called bone marrow.


There are three types of blood cells:


red blood cells, which carry oxygen


white blood cells, which are important for fighting infection


platelets, which help your blood to clot.


If you have myeloma, your body starts making an abnormal type of white blood cell.
These abnormal white cells are called myeloma cells. They can’t do their usual job
of fighting infection, but instead they build up in your bone marrow.

This build-up of myeloma cells can damage the bone and cause bone pain. It also means
that the bone marrow can’t make enough healthy blood cells.

The average age for being diagnosed with myeloma is about 60. It’s more common in
men than in women. Myeloma is not common in young people.

Doctors don’t know what causes myeloma.
What are the symptoms?
Not everyone with myeloma gets symptoms. But these are the most common problems people
get:



Pain in their bones, often felt as backache. About 80 in 100 people with myeloma have
bone pain. It’s caused by the build-up of myeloma cells. This may also make your bones
weak and more likely to break.



Anaemia. This means you don’t have enough red blood cells carrying oxygen around your
body. You may feel very tired or look pale.

About 70 in 100 people with myeloma have anaemia. It happens because your bone marrow
can’t produce enough normal blood cells.



Because you don’t have enough healthy white blood cells you may get lots of infections,
like urinary tract infections or pneumonia.

Some people with myeloma get too much calcium in their blood (called hypercalcaemia).
Too much calcium can cause problems with your kidneys and your heart.

Other symptoms are caused by a substance called paraprotein, which is made by the
myeloma cells. This can damage your kidneys and nerves, among other things.

The symptoms you get depend on the type of paraprotein your myeloma cells make. You
can ask your doctor about this.

What tests will I need?
If your doctor suspects that you may have myeloma, you’ll need a range of tests to
find out.

The first test for myeloma is done on your urine and blood. The laboratory is looking
for signs of paraprotein. If the test shows paraprotein in your urine or blood, you
probably have myeloma.

The rest of the tests are done to confirm the diagnosis, or to find out what stage
the illness is at, and how it’s affecting your body.

You’ll have a series of x-rays of your body to look for damage to your bones. This
is called a skeletal survey. You may also have MRI or CT scans if the doctors want
to get a clearer look at your bones.

You will also have a sample of your bone marrow taken to check for myeloma cells in
your bone marrow. A bone marrow sample is taken using a needle put into your bone
(usually your hip bone). You’ll have a local anaesthetic to numb the area so it doesn’t
hurt.

You’ll need regular blood tests. These help your doctors see what your myeloma cells
are doing and how you are responding to treatment. Things doctors check include:



how much calcium you have in your blood


how many healthy blood cells you have


how well your kidneys are working


how much paraprotein you have in your blood.


What treatments are available?
There’s no cure for myeloma. But treating myeloma may help get rid of your bone pain,
and afterwards you should feel less tired.

You may then have months or years when you don’t have any symptoms or signs of myeloma.
This is called remission. Doctors are working on new treatments all the time, which
may work even better than current treatments.

The type of treatment you need will depend on your general health, your age, and how
the cancer has affected your body. The main treatments for myeloma are anti-cancer drugs (chemotherapy and newer treatments), which may be followed by transplants of stem cells.

Not everyone with myeloma needs treatment straight away. Some people have signs of
paraprotein in their blood but no symptoms.

These people usually have blood tests every three to six months to keep an eye on
their condition. But they won’t need treatment unless the myeloma cells start to reproduce
and cause symptoms.

Anti-cancer drugs
Chemotherapy drugs are designed to kill off your myeloma cells. They do this by targeting cells that
are dividing rapidly.

This means they kill cancer cells but also some healthy cells, such as those that
grow your hair, and cells inside your mouth and gut. So you’re likely to get side
effects while you’re taking chemotherapy drugs.

These side effects may include losing your hair, getting mouth ulcers, and having
an upset stomach. After you finish treatment, these problems should go away and your
hair should grow back.

Most people with myeloma will have newer treatments along with one chemotherapy drug,
although the drugs will differ depending on



the state of your health


your age


what other treatments you are having, and


how myeloma is affecting your body.


Combinations of different drugs are also used. Some of these drugs are given by an
IV drip. Others are taken as tablets.

You’re likely to have several ‘cycles’ of treatment, lasting around four to six weeks
each. In between, you have time for your body to recover.

Transplants of stem cells
Some people have very high doses of chemotherapy followed by transplants of stem cells.
High doses of chemotherapy kill the myeloma cells, but they also kill your bone marrow
stem cells. These are early stage cells that grow into red blood cells, white blood
cells, and platelets.

Having a stem cell transplant replenishes these early stage cells, so you can make
healthy blood cells again.

There are two types of transplant:


An autologous stem cell transplant means the transplant comes from your own stem cells. This is
the type of transplant most people have.



An allogeneic stem cell transplant means the transplant comes from donated stem cells, usually
from your brother or sister, if they have the same tissue type as you. This is less
common.



Transplants are given as infusions into your bloodstream. It’s a bit like having a
blood transfusion.

If you have a transplant using your own stem cells, you’ll have your stem cells collected
from your blood before you have high-dose chemotherapy. They’ll be stored until after
your chemotherapy.

High-dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplants are only suitable for people in generally
good health. Doctors don’t usually recommend these treatments for people aged over
70.

Other treatments
You may also need treatments to relieve your symptoms of myeloma. Drugs called bisphosphonates are used to treat bone pain and weakness. If you have bad bone pain in a particular
area you may have radiotherapy to target the myeloma cells in that part of your bone marrow.

You may need blood transfusions, or you may need to take medication to treat severe anaemia.

You’ll probably need pain relief, which could be simple paracetamol. Or your doctor may prescribe stronger pain relief medicines if your pain is very
bad or if you have nerve pain.

All these stronger painkillers are likely to have side effects. Your doctor will tell
you what to expect and how to manage any side effects or keep them to a minimum.

Things you can do for yourself
There are several things you can do to help yourself keep healthy and get the most
out of treatment.



Drink plenty of water. Having myeloma can increase the amount of calcium in your blood,
which can damage your kidneys. Kidneys filter fluid in the body. If you drink plenty
of fluid, your kidneys have a better chance at coping with the extra calcium.



Tell your doctor quickly if you get any infections. Myeloma means your body finds
it harder to fight off infections, so it’s important to get them treated quickly.
Also, chemotherapy treatments can make it hard for you to fight infections.



Make sure you are up to date on your flu and pneumonia vaccinations. This will help
protect you against these common infections.



Talk to your doctor about side effects from treatment. Your doctor may be able to
switch you to a different type of treatment or give you other treatments that mask
the side effects.



Think about what you most want to get out of your treatment and make sure your doctor
knows. Different people have different priorities, so it’s important that you and
your doctor are both aiming for the same results.

For some people, pain relief and a good quality of life are the most important things.
For others, it’s about having the treatment that can help them live as long as possible.



Many of the treatments for myeloma should help with bone pain. But if you’re still
in pain tell your doctor or nurses. They can give you strong painkillers to reduce
your pain.



What to expect in the future?
It’s very hard to say what will happen to any individual with myeloma because it affects
people in very different ways.

Some people don't live very long after being diagnosed, while others live for many
years. About half of people are still alive five years after being diagnosed. As with
other types of cancer, earlier diagnosis is linked to better outcomes.

Your individual outlook will depend on many things, including how old you are, how
generally healthy you are, and how quickly your myeloma cells are growing. It will
also depend on which type of treatment is suitable for you.

If your treatment is successful, you may live many years without any signs of myeloma.
If you work, you’ll be able to return to your job once your blood tests are back to
normal.

But you may feel very tired for the first few months. Working part time at first may
help. You may need some help to get back to your normal life: for example, a physiotherapist
can help you strengthen your muscles.

Some people take long-term medicines (called maintenance treatment) to keep their
myeloma in remission for as long as possible.

But even after successful treatment, myeloma comes back eventually for most people.
When this happens there are a number of further treatments you can try. You can talk
to your doctors about what's right for you."

Mouth ulcers can be painful, especially if you keep getting them. Fortunately there
are treatments that may help your mouth ulcers heal more quickly and hurt less.

You can use our information to talk to your doctor or pharmacist and decide which
treatments are right for you.

What are mouth ulcers?
There are several types of mouth ulcer. But the most common ones, and the ones we
cover here, are small, greyish/white sores inside your mouth, in which the top layer
of the skin is damaged. Doctors call these ordinary mouth ulcers aphthous ulcers.

It's possible to get more than one at a time. They can appear on the inside of the
cheeks, inside the lips, and on the tongue. The ulcer is usually red around the rim.

Everyone has mouth ulcers at some point in life. But some people keep getting mouth
ulcers every few months or weeks, or even every few days.

Most mouth ulcers are small. They are usually less than 5 millimetres (one-fifth of
an inch) across. They usually heal after a week or two. A few people get ulcers that
are bigger and take longer to heal. Bigger ulcers can also leave scars.

You can also get lots of small, painful ulcers called herpetiform ulcers. Their exact
cause is not known.

In fact, no one really knows what causes most ulcers. But you might be more likely
to get them if:



you have too little iron, folic acid, or vitamin B-12 in your blood. Mouth ulcers
can sometimes be caused by a lack of vitamin C, especially in older people.



you are sensitive to gluten, which is a protein found in wheat (sensitivity to gluten
is called coeliac disease).



you injure your mouth (for example, by biting the inside of your cheek or grazing
it with a sharp tooth).



they run in your family.


Some people seem to get ulcers after eating or drinking certain things: for example,
chocolate, coffee, and peanuts.

In a small number of people, ulcers are caused by infections or other illnesses. If
you have ulcers that are bigger than a few millimetres they may be being caused by
another condition, and you should see your doctor.

If you get other symptoms with mouth ulcers, such as fever, stomach upset, weight
loss, or ulcers elsewhere on your body, tell your doctor. It could be a sign that
you have another condition.

What are the symptoms?
Mouth ulcers can be very sore. Eating or talking may make the pain worse. If you often
have difficulty eating because of mouth ulcers, you need to take care that you don't
lose too much weight.

If your child has ulcers and refuses to eat, your doctor may suggest ways he or she
can get enough nutrients.

What treatments work?
Antiseptic mouthwash
Chlorhexidine is an antiseptic that can make your ulcers less painful and clear up
faster. But we're not sure if it can stop you getting repeat attacks of ulcers.

Chlorhexidine can cause mild side effects in some people. For example, some people
don't like the taste, and some people say it makes them feel a little sick. If you
use it every day, it can stain your teeth and tongue brown. This discoloration should
go away when you stop using it.

You should leave an interval of at least 30 minutes between using chlorhexidine and
using toothpaste.

Hexetidine and thymol are other antiseptic mouthwashes but they don't seem to have
any effect on mouth ulcers.

Steroid mouthwashes
Some steroid medicines (the full name is corticosteroids) may make your ulcers less
painful and heal them more quickly. But it’s not clear whether they will help you
get ulcers less often.

These steroid medicines come as mouthwashes, creams, pastes, sprays, and lozenges.
You can buy some of these from pharmacies. For others, you'll need a prescription
from your doctor or dentist.

The steroids for mouth ulcers have been designed so that very little of the medicine
gets into the rest of your body, so side effects are rare. Occasionally, they may
cause a mouth infection called thrush.

Painkillers that you put on mouth ulcers
You can put some painkillers directly onto mouth ulcers. These come as mouth washes,
sprays, lozenges, and gels. They should help to reduce the pain caused by an ulcer,
but you may need to keep reapplying them as they can come off easily.

You can buy most of these from a pharmacy. You should read the instructions carefully
as some are not recommended for children under 16.

Things you can do for yourself
Here are some things you can try that may help you when you get mouth ulcers, and
that might help you to avoid getting more mouth ulcers:



Make sure you clean your teeth properly, three times a day, to avoid getting infections.


Ask your dentist what size toothbrush you should use. The wrong size brush can lead
to scratches and other injuries in your mouth that might cause mouth ulcers.



Avoid acidic drinks, such as fruit juices or fizzy drinks, or drink them through a
straw so they don't irritate your mouth.



Avoid very spicy food and sharp food, such as crisps, which can scratch your mouth.


What will happen to me?
If your mouth ulcers keep coming back, or if you have an ulcer that takes more than
a week to heal, you should see your dentist or doctor.

Having repeat attacks of ulcers can be distressing. You can take painkillers, such
as ibuprofen or paracetamol, to help with the pain.

Mouth ulcers are most common in teenagers and young adults. You may find you get them
less often as you get older."

When you're pregnant it's normal to feel sick at times, and sometimes to vomit. You
might find that some simple treatments can help.

We've brought together the best and most up-to-date research about morning sickness
to see which treatments work. You can use our information to talk to your doctor and
decide which treatments are best for you.

What is it?
Most pregnant women feel sick and even vomit sometimes during pregnancy. For many
women these are the first signs that they are pregnant. Some women view these symptoms
as signs that their pregnancy is probably healthy.

Nausea and vomiting usually begin around six weeks after the start of your last period.
This is often called 'morning sickness', because many women find that their symptoms
are worst in the mornings. But women can get these symptoms at any time of the day.


Even if you are sick two or three times a day, you will usually be able to keep some
food down. You probably won't lose weight during the first few months of your pregnancy.
And your morning sickness won’t affect your baby unless it is severe.

Although it’s normal to feel sick or be sick when you're pregnant, it’s not normal
to be so sick that you can't hold down any food or fluids for more than 24 hours.
If this happens you can become dehydrated and you may need to be treated in hospital
to replace the fluids and nourishment you're losing.

If you feel like you can’t hold down any fluids for more than 24 hours, or if you
feel dizzy, or if you’re worried about your condition, you should see your doctor.

What treatments work?
Things you can do to help yourself
As well as treatments that your doctor may suggest, here are some things that you
might find helpful in reducing feelings of sickness.



Eating little and often (for example, every two to three hours) rather than eating
big meals



Eating bland food, such as dry crackers or toast


Eating ginger biscuits


Avoiding fatty foods


Drinking lots of liquid (but avoiding alcohol and caffeine)


Eating something salty early in the day


Drinking sour liquids, such as unsweetened fruit juices, rather than plain water


Getting some fresh air and exercise daily.


If morning sickness bothers you so much that you need to see your doctor, the treatment
you are offered will depend on how severe your symptoms are. For example, if you become
dehydrated this can harm your growing baby, so your doctor will make sure you get
treatment quickly.

But doctors usually try to avoid giving medicines for morning sickness, as they will
want to expose your growing baby to as few drugs as possible.

So if your symptoms are not severe your doctor will probably suggest some non-drug
treatments first. There isn't as much research as we'd like on these treatments. But
some women find that they help.

Treatment without drugs
Ginger
Ginger is a natural remedy and one of the most widely used treatments for nausea and
vomiting. It is a spicy root used to flavour food such as gingerbread, biscuits, and
stir-fried vegetables. It's also found in drinks such as ginger tea, ginger ale, and
ginger beer.

But you probably won’t get enough ginger by eating or drinking foods that contain
it. You’ll need to take supplements. But this should be supervised by your doctor.
You can get ginger supplements as capsules, or as a syrup. These supplements seem
to reduce symptoms of nausea and vomiting in most women.

Acupressure
Wearing an acupressure wristband over a certain place on your forearm (called the
P6 point) seems to help reduce nausea and vomiting in some women. But some women find
that the wristband causes numbness, soreness, and swelling.

Acupuncture
Some women find that acupuncture helps relieve their morning sickness symptoms.
Treatment with drugs
If you are getting a lot of nausea and vomiting, your doctor may recommend a type
of drug called an antihistamine. Antihistamines are drugs that are usually used to relieve allergies, such as hay
fever. But you shouldn't take these for morning sickness unless they are prescribed
by your doctor.

Your doctor might suggest an anti-emetic. These are drugs that help to stop you from feeling sick and from vomiting.

Vitamin B6 supplements may make you feel less sick, and reduce the number of times you vomit. Vitamin B6
is usually contained in multivitamin supplements for pregnant women. But the dose
of vitamin B6 in these supplements may not be as high as that found to relieve nausea
and vomiting in pregnancy. Doctors will sometimes prescribe higher levels of vitamin
B6 to treat morning sickness. But it's not available everywhere. For example, it is
not recommended in the UK because of concerns that high levels might harm unborn babies.

What will happen to me?
The good news is that morning sickness usually gets better after the first three months
of pregnancy. But for some women it can go on longer. About 10 in 100 women still
feel sick after 20 weeks of pregnancy."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/3000264/Monoclonal%20gammopathy%20of%20undetermined%20significance,Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance,"Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance Last published: Oct 10, 2022
Having monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS for short) means that
some of your blood cells don’t develop normally.

This often doesn’t cause any problems, and MGUS is not cancer. But some people with
MGUS go on to develop cancers that affect the blood or bone marrow. So people with
MGUS need tests about once a year, to check for any changes.

You can use our information to talk to your doctor about MGUS.
What is monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS)?
Everyone has several different types of blood cells, which do different jobs in the
body. For example:



red blood cells carry oxygen to where it’s needed



white blood cells help fight infection, and



plasma cells, which are a type of white blood cell, produce proteins called antibodies. These
antibodies allow the body to identify and fight bacteria and viruses.



If you have MGUS, some of your plasma cells don’t develop properly. They also produce an abnormal type of protein that can be
detected in your blood, called an M protein.

This protein doesn’t usually cause any symptoms or any problems in the short term.
But some people diagnosed with MGUS worry that it’s similar to blood cancers, such
as multiple myeloma or leukaemia.

But MGUS is not cancer. And, while some people with MGUS go on to develop one of these types of blood cancer,
most don’t.

Who gets MGUS?
MGUS is most common in middle-aged and older people. About 2 or 3 in every 100 people
over the age of 50 have MGUS. Things that make someone more likely to have MGUS include:



being over 50


being a man


having African ancestry


having a family history of MGUS or of multiple myeloma


having been exposed to very high levels of radiation, and


having been exposed to high levels of pesticides.


You might hear your doctor talk about different types of MGUS, and about whether these
put you at a lower risk or higher risk of developing blood cancer. But there’s no
way of knowing whether an individual person will go on to have problems.

What are the symptoms?
MGUS doesn’t usually cause any symptoms. People usually find out that they have it
when they have tests - for example, a blood test - because of something else that’s
bothering them.

When MGUS does cause symptoms they usually affect the nerves. For example, some people
with MGUS have:



numbness and tingling (pins and needles) in some parts of the body. This is called
paraesthesia


problems with speech and balance, called ataxia, or



an unusual sense of touch, called dysaesthesia. This can cause feelings, such as itching, burning, tickling, cold sensations, and
sometimes pain.



If you have a test that suggests that you have MGUS, your doctor will probably want
to do some tests to make sure that it’s MGUS and not something else.

These will probably be blood and urine tests. But your doctor may also suggest bone
marrow or other tests to rule out blood cancer.

What treatments are available?
There is no cure for MGUS, and most people don’t need any treatment because it doesn’t
usually cause any symptoms or problems.

The main things that your doctor will suggest to help you will be that you:


keep an eye out for any symptoms, and


have regular follow-up appointments for tests to make sure that your MGUS is not developing into something else. For example, most
people have follow-up tests about once a year.



These regular tests mean that, if you do develop a type of blood cancer, it can be
caught early, when it’s easier to treat.

If you have any symptoms that affect your nerves, your doctor may be able to prescribe
medicines to help relieve these symptoms. And you should always tell your doctor if
you notice any new or unusual symptoms.

What to expect in the future
Most people with MGUS don’t go on to develop blood cancer or related problems. But
some do. So it’s important to keep up with your follow-up appointments.

Every year about 1 in every 100 people with MGUS will go on to develop blood cancers
or similar problems, such as leukaemia, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, or multiple myeloma.

People’s chances of developing problems depend on various risk factors. A risk factor is something that makes something else more likely to happen.

For example, risk factors for MGUS becoming blood cancer include things like being
older, being male, and having a higher-risk type of MGUS.

Research suggests that, within 20 years of being diagnosed with MGUS:


about 5 in 100 people at low risk will go on to develop blood cancer or a similar
condition



about 21 in 100 people at low-to-medium risk will go on to develop problems


about 37 in 100 people at medium risk will go on to develop problems, and


about 58 in 100 people at high risk will go on to develop problems.


If these numbers look worrying, it’s important to remember that the largest group
of people with MGUS are those at low risk.

MGUS and other health problems
People with MGUS are slightly more likely than people without it to have health problems,
such as heart, liver, and kidney conditions.

But these problems are probably not caused by MGUS. It’s more likely that these problems
were already there, and that they were what led to the MGUS being detected and diagnosed."

Monkeypox is a rare disease caused by a virus called the monkeypox virus. It is not
usually seen outside of West and Central Africa.

But travellers to these areas sometimes become infected. Cases of monkeypox have been
found in a number of countries outside Africa in 2022.

In July 2022 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the monkeypox outbreak to
be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.

Monkeypox usually goes away by itself after a few weeks, but it can be dangerous in
some people, especially children. If you think you have symptoms of monkeypox, avoid
contact with others, and talk to a doctor urgently.

What is monkeypox?
The monkeypox virus is mainly found in West and Central Africa. Humans can catch it from animals that carry the virus, and it can then pass from
person to person.

There are two variants of monkeypox: the Central African and the West African variants.
The Central African variant causes a more severe illness than the West African variant.

Monkeypox is rarely found outside Africa. But in the Spring of 2022 a number of people
were found to have the infection in North and South America, Australia, parts of Asia,
and many countries in Europe, including the UK.

Monkeypox is usually what doctors call self-limiting. This means that after a while it goes away by itself, just like a cold or flu. After
you have had monkeypox you are immune and you can’t get it again.

But monkeypox can sometimes cause serious illness, especially in children and those
with weakened immune systems.

Monkeypox can cause death, but this is rare, especially from the West African variant,
and in areas with good health care. So far, the latest outbreak seems to involve only
the less dangerous West African variant.



With the Central African variant, between 3 and 6 in every 100 people will die from it.



With the less dangerous West African variant, less than 1 in 100 people will die.



There is a vaccine (called vaccinia) that offers a great deal of protection against monkeypox. It was
developed mainly to protect people against smallpox, which has now been wiped out. But the two viruses are similar, so the vaccinia vaccine
works against both.

The vaccine is usually given to people who are thought to have a strong chance of
becoming infected. This includes:



health workers in certain countries, and


close contacts of people who are infected.


How does it spread?
Monkeypox usually spreads through skin-to-skin contact. This means that you can become
infected by touching the rash, scabs, skin blisters, or bodily fluids of someone who
has the infection.

But you usually need to have close contact with an infected person for some time.
A brief, passing contact is not likely to cause infection.

Monkeypox can also spread by:


contact with objects that have come into contact with the virus, such as clothes,
bedding, towels, and surfaces, and



droplets breathed out through the mouth and nose of an infected person (for example,
from coughing or sneezing).



The virus can also be passed from pregnant mothers to their babies in the womb.
So far, most of the people infected in the 2022 outbreak are men who identify as gay, bisexual, or men who have sex with men. We’re not sure why this is. But these groups are being advised to be alert for any
unusual rashes, especially on their genitals.

Monkeypox is not usually thought of as a sexually transmitted infection (STI), and
it's still not clear what role, if any, sexual bodily fluids play in infection.

But infection can be caused by the close physical contact that happens during sexual
activity.

Monkeypox has an incubation period of about one to two weeks. This means that you can have the virus for up to two weeks
before you have symptoms, and without knowing that you have it.

What are the symptoms?
The most common symptoms of monkeypox include:


a rash of blisters on the body and face


fever


headache


backache


general aches and pains


sore throat


vomiting


general weakness, and


swollen glands.


Less common symptoms include:


diarrhoea


delirium (confusion and feeling unsteady), and


seizures.


The monkeypox rash starts with flat areas on the skin that then become bumps filled with liquid, which
then turns to pus after a few days. After about two weeks the bumps become scabs and
start to drop off.

The rash can be itchy and painful, but it’s important not to scratch or burst the bumps, as this can spread the virus and lead to scarring.

In the 2022 outbreak, the monkeypox rash seems to be slightly different from previous outbreaks. The features
of the rash in this outbreak include:



fewer blisters (doctors often call them lesions) than usual. Some people only have one or two



blisters/lesions appearing at different times during the illness. Monkeypox blisters
usually appear at about the same time



blisters/lesions in the genital area and around the anus, which do not spread any
further



severe pain in the rectal and anal areas, and


blisters appearing earlier than usual in the course of the illness.


Blisters can sometimes happen in the mouth. This can be painful, and it can make it
hard to eat and drink normally. If this happens to you, talk to your doctor about
how they can help. It's important to get enough nurtition and to stay hydrated when
recovering from monkeypox.

If you see a doctor with symptoms of monkeypox they will take a sample of liquid from
one of the lumps on your rash and test it for the virus.

If it’s possible that you caught the infection while travelling or staying in an area
where malaria is common, you should also be tested for malaria.

What treatments are available?
Monkeypox usually clears up by itself after a few weeks. This means that many people
with monkeypox don’t need any special treatment, and don’t need to be treated in hospital.

But people with monkeypox need to be isolated while they have symptoms, so that the virus doesn’t spread. This means that you should
stay away from people and from pets until you no longer have symptoms. This will probably take three or four weeks.

If you have been in contact with someone who has been infected, you should also isolate
for 21 days.

Treatment in hospital
Most people with monkeypox recover at home in a few weeks. But about 10 in every 100
people need to be treated in hospital. This often happens when people become dehydrated from fever or vomiting and need to have fluids given into a vein.

Some people also need treatment for sepsis. Sepsis happens when the body’s immune system overreacts to an infection and attacks
the body’s tissues instead of protecting them. If you have sepsis you will be given
antibiotics into a vein.

Sepsis is a medical emergency and can cause death if not treated in time. The signs of sepsis to look out for are:




confusion


shortness of breath


fast heart rate


fever, or feeling very cold, and


clammy or sweaty skin.


Medicines
In most people the body’s immune system fights off the virus by itself, and medicines
aren’t needed.

Antiviral medicines are sometimes given to people with severe symptoms. But if your symptoms are not
severe these drugs won’t make much difference to how soon you get better.

Medicines for specific symptoms
If you have a headache or other painful symptoms, you can take paracetamol If you are being treated in hospital, you might be given stronger pain relief drugs,
such as opioids.

If you have painful blisters in your mouth, your doctor might recommend an antiseptic mouthwash or local anaesthetic cream. Your doctor might also recommend local anaesthetic cream for painful blisters in the genital area or around the anus.

Antihistamines, which are usually used to treat allergies, are sometimes used to help with itching.

If you have severe nausea or vomiting, you might be given drugs called anti-emetics, which can help settle your stomach.


If needed, you might also be given medicines to help with heartburn, stomach ache, and seizures.

What to expect in the future
Monkeypox is unpleasant but it’s usually not serious, and most people recover within
a few weeks. But the effects can affect some people for a long time.

For example, the rash can cause scarring and discoloured skin in some people. This can sometimes be permanent. This can be upsetting, and
some people need counselling and support. Your doctor might be able to help arrange
this.

Some people with severe dehydration can have kidney damage after recovering from monkeypox.
If this happens, you might need to have treatment.

In people who are severely affected, monkeypox can sometimes affect the eyes and cause
blindness. If you are being treated in hospital and show signs of monkeypox affecting
your eyes, you should be given antiviral eye drops to help prevent this.

The vaccinia vaccine can also cause problems in some people. This is called progressive vaccinia. If this
happens to you, you will need treatment with antiviral medicines.

Monkeypox can sometimes cause death. But this is rare, especially in countries with
good healthcare facilities."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1454685160653/Mitral%20valve%20prolapse,Mitral valve prolapse,"Mitral valve prolapse Last published: Jan 17, 2022
If you have mitral valve prolapse it means that one of the valves in your heart doesn't
close properly. This doesn’t usually cause any problems. But if it gets worse it can
cause symptoms. Treatment can help with these symptoms.

We've brought together the research about mitral valve prolapse and talked to experts
about the best way to treat it. You can use our information to talk to your doctor
and decide which treatments are best for you.

What is mitral valve prolapse?
The heart has four parts or chambers: an upper and lower chamber on both the left
and right sides. Oxygen-rich blood from the lungs arrives at the top chamber on the
left side of the heart.

This blood is pumped to the lower chamber and then out to the rest of the body, delivering
oxygen to the body’s cells.

The mitral valve sits between the upper and lower chambers on the left side of the
heart. It helps to keep blood that’s pumped from the upper chamber in the lower chamber.

If the valve doesn’t close properly, blood can leak back towards the lungs. If this
happens just a little it’s not usually a problem. But if it gets more severe it’s
called mitral valve regurgitation, and this can cause symptoms.

MVP affects about 2 in 100 people. Men and women are equally likely to get it. Certain
things can increase someone's chance of getting MVP, including:



having a problem with the tissues that hold the structures of the body together (called
connective tissue). For example, having a condition called Marfan’s syndrome or having
adult polycystic kidney disease.



having sickle cell disease.


having rheumatic heart disease.


There are many names for MVP. For example, you might hear it called:


click-murmur syndrome


Barlow's syndrome


floppy valve syndrome


ballooning mitral valve syndrome.


What are the symptoms?
Many people with MVP never get any symptoms. When symptoms do happen it's usually
because blood is leaking back into the upper left chamber of the heart (regurgitation).

In severe cases, blood can leak into the lungs. Not everyone with MVP gets all the
same symptoms. But symptoms can include:



a fast heartbeat


an irregular heartbeat


dizziness


trouble catching your breath


tiredness


chest pain


anxiety.


If you get any of these symptoms, they will probably start off mild and get worse
very gradually. If you notice any of these symptoms it’s important to see your doctor.

Your doctor will listen to your heart using a stethoscope to see if there might be
something wrong.

If your doctor thinks you might have MVP, you’ll probably have a scan called an echocardiogram.
This is an ultrasound of the heart. It helps doctors see the structures of the heart,
including the valves.

If you don’t have symptoms your doctor will reassure you that your condition does
not need to be treated. You don’t need to change your lifestyle or do anything different.

But it’s always a good idea to follow advice for a healthy heart, whether or not you
have MVP. This means:



not smoking


eating healthily, and


taking regular exercise.


And if you notice any new symptoms, see your doctor.
What treatments work?
Most people with MVP don’t need any treatment. But if your condition gets worse and
you get symptoms you may need to take medicines. And some people need surgery.

Medicines
If you have MVP and get a fast or irregular heartbeat or get anxious, your doctor
might advise you to avoid or cut down on caffeine and alcohol to see if this helps.

If this doesn’t help, your doctor might prescribe a type of medicine called a beta blocker. These medicines help your heart beat more slowly and with less force. They also
help to relax your blood vessels. All these things can help you feel less anxious.


Your doctor might prescribe a type of drug to make your blood less likely to clot.
These are called blood-thinning drugs. They reduce your chance of having a stroke
or mini-stroke (called a transient ischaemic attack or TIA).

You might need one of these blood-thinning drugs if you:


have ever had a mini-stroke or a stroke, or


have a heart condition called atrial fibrillation (where your heart beats in an irregular
way and usually very quickly).



Commonly used blood-thinning drugs are aspirin and warfarin. If you are prescribed
warfarin you will need to follow your doctor’s instructions carefully and have regular
blood tests.

Surgery
If blood leaks back to the upper chamber of your heart (regurgitation) and this is
severe you may need surgery on your mitral valve.

The surgeon will repair the valve if possible. But if this can’t be done he or she
will replace the valve with an artificial one. Artificial valves are made of metal
or of animal tissue (for example, from a pig’s heart valve).

Surgery should help to stop your heart getting weak. It should also reduce the chance
of problems that can come with severe regurgitation.

Surgery on the mitral valve is a major operation. You will have a general anaesthetic,
so you will not be awake during the operation. Most mitral valve operations are done
using open surgery, when the chest is cut open.

It takes a long time to recover from this open surgery, because the bone in your chest
needs to heal. But keyhole surgery (also called thoracoscopic surgery), which uses
several small cuts instead of one large one, is becoming more common.

What will happen to me?
The outlook for people with MVP is very good. Most people with MVP don’t have any
symptoms or need any treatment. And having MVP doesn't affect how long you’re likely
to live.

But complications can happen, especially if you’re middle aged or older. If you have
severe regurgitation you could get heart failure, which means your heart can’t pump
properly. But surgery can repair the valve so that this doesn’t happen.

If you have a faulty valve, as is the case with MVP, there’s a chance that the lining
of the valve could get infected. This is called endocarditis.

To help prevent this, doctors used to offer antibiotics to people with MVP before
some dental and medical procedures. But this is no longer thought to be routinely
necessary."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1290014790710/Miscarriage,Miscarriage,"Miscarriage Last published: Oct 14, 2020
A miscarriage is the unexpected loss of a pregnancy. This can be deeply sad and upsetting
for people trying for a baby. Miscarriages can happen to anyone. Most people go on
to have healthy pregnancies and babies in future.

What is a miscarriage?
A miscarriage happens when a pregnancy ends unexpectedly before the developing baby
is old enough to survive on its own. Miscarriages can happen as late as the 22nd week
of pregnancy, but most (97 in every 100) happen during the first 12 weeks.

We do not know exactly how many pregnancies end in miscarriage, because sometimes
people with an early miscarriage do not know they were pregnant. Doctors think between
10 in 100 and 30 in 100 pregnancies end in miscarriage.

Most people never know why their pregnancy ended in miscarriage. Studies show that
most miscarriages happen because of problems that stop the baby from developing and
growing.

These are usually random genetic errors that happen in the early stages of growth,
not genetic problems inherited from the parents.

Any woman can miscarry. However, certain things make it more likely. These are called
risk factors. Having a risk factor doesn't mean you will have a miscarriage. It just
means you have a greater chance than someone without the risk factor of having a miscarriage.
Risk factors for miscarriage include:



older age: a woman's chance of having a miscarriage increases as she gets older. Your risk
at age 45 is eight times higher than at age 20. The risk of miscarriage also increases
as the father gets older.



abnormalities in the womb: having an unusually short or weak opening to your womb (cervix) can increase your
risk. So can large fibroids (non-cancerous lumps in the womb).



medical conditions: certain long-term diseases, such as thyroid problems, make a miscarriage more likely.
Good antenatal care can reduce this risk.



blood-clotting disorders: people with these disorders, called thrombophilias, form blood clots too easily.
This increases the chance of miscarriage.



obesity: women who are very overweight (obese) have a greater chance of miscarriage.



two or more previous miscarriages: if you have had more than one miscarriage before, you are more likely to miscarry
again. But if you have had only one miscarriage, you are no more likely to miscarry
than women who have never miscarried before.



smoking or using illegal drugs while pregnant: drinking a lot of caffeine may also increase your risk, although there is only weak
evidence that caffeine is linked to miscarriage.



Despite what you might have heard, the following things don't increase your chance of miscarriage:



exercising


having sex


working (as long as you're not working with harmful substances), and


having an internal examination by a midwife or doctor.


What are the symptoms?
These symptoms may mean you are having a miscarriage:


Bleeding or spotting: this can be light or heavy. Many women get some bleeding in their first 12 weeks
and this does not always lead to miscarriage.



Abdominal cramps: the cramping can be on one side, on both sides, or in the middle. The pain may be
like period pain, or it can be more severe.

You should always get medical help if you have severe cramps when pregnant. It could
be a sign of an ectopic pregnancy (where the embryo grows outside the womb), which
needs emergency treatment.



Low back pain: this is sometimes described as a persistent, dull ache.



Fluid or tissue passing from your vagina.



These symptoms don't automatically mean you're miscarrying, but you should see your
doctor straight away to have them checked out. Your doctor will ask you questions
about your symptoms and pregnancy. You will probably be referred to the Early Pregnancy
Unit at your local hospital. You are likely to have:



a pelvic examination: this can show whether your cervix has begun to open (dilate), which is a sign of
miscarriage.



blood tests: one of the main tests measures a hormone called beta hCG.



an ultrasound scan: this is used to check for a heartbeat and whether the baby is developing normally.



Women’s experience of miscarriage varies a lot. For some women, it’s similar to the
experience of having a monthly period. But it can be frightening, especially if you
are in a lot of pain and bleeding heavily.

You should be offered painkillers to make you more comfortable. Rarely, women with
heavy bleeding need blood or plasma transfusions. But it’s very rare for a miscarriage
to cause lasting health problems.

What treatments work?
There’s nothing you can do to prevent or stop a miscarriage. The aim of treatment
is to make you as comfortable as possible, and to help your body recover.

Your doctor may describe your miscarriage as missed, incomplete, or complete. This
is about whether the tissues from your pregnancy, including the baby and the placenta,
have passed out of your body.



A missed miscarriage means that the pregnancy has ended but the tissues remain in the womb.



An incomplete miscarriage means that some, but not all, of the tissues have left the body.



A complete miscarriage means that all the tissues have passed from the body.



Many women who miscarry early in their pregnancy will have a complete miscarriage
by the time they see their doctor or soon after. These women do not need further treatment
for their miscarriage.

But if a miscarriage is not complete, there are three treatment options. Many hospitals
suggest letting the miscarriage finish naturally if possible. You may need surgery
if you are bleeding heavily, or if you have any signs of infection.



Letting the miscarriage finish naturally: After a pregnancy has ended, it can take two to four weeks for all the tissues to
leave your body. With an early miscarriage, you are not likely to see the baby.

Most women who have an early miscarriage only see blood clots. When you have stopped
bleeding, the miscarriage is probably complete. You might need an ultrasound scan
to check, but this is not often needed.



Drug treatment: Medicines can help the cervix to open, allowing the tissues to pass out. You may
be offered a tablet called misoprostol to put into your vagina.



Minor surgery: Your doctor can remove the tissues through a surgical procedure. Doctors call this
evacuation of retained products of conception (ERPC), or surgical evacuation. Your
doctor will gently stretch the neck of your womb and insert a tube to empty the womb.
You'll probably have a general anaesthetic, so you'll be asleep for this procedure.




What will happen to me?
Some women bleed for several weeks after a miscarriage. If you've lost a lot of blood,
you may need to take iron tablets to avoid anaemia. You may feel very tired, and find
you get upset easily.

As well as the trauma and sadness, your body is dealing with changes in hormone levels,
which can affect your emotions.

Grieving and emotional recovery
Women react to miscarriage in different ways. You may feel you need to take it slowly
and take time off work. Or you may feel better soon and want to get back to your normal
routine.

However, the emotional impact of a miscarriage can take longer to heal. You and your
partner should be offered counselling to help you work through your emotions. You
may feel grief, shock, disappointment, disbelief, anger, and even guilt.

These feelings can take time to surface and to deal with. Talking to a counsellor,
and having the support of family and friends, can help you through this grieving process.

Trying again
A woman's body quickly recovers from a miscarriage, and some people start trying to
get pregnant again soon after. There is no medical reason to delay trying again if
you want to.

If you want to try again, you can start planning for your next pregnancy. Most women
who have one miscarriage go on to have a successful pregnancy next time around.

If you've had three or more miscarriages, your doctor may suggest you have tests,
to see whether there is a particular cause.

You’ll probably have blood tests for antiphospholipid syndrome, which is a blood-clotting
disorder. But because miscarriage is so common, you probably won’t have tests if you've
had fewer than three miscarriages.

There are various organisations and groups that support people affected by miscarriage.
For example, in the UK, The Miscarriage Association (miscarriageassociation.org.uk)
offers help and information."

If you're the parent of a child or teenager who gets migraines, you know how upsetting
these headaches can be. If your child gets migraines frequently, you might want to
consider medicines to prevent them.

You can use our information to talk to your doctor and decide which treatments are
right for your child. There are also treatments that can help your child with their
symptoms during a migraine attack, whether their attacks are frequent or not. To learn
more, see our leaflet Migraine in children.

Why might my child need medicines to prevent migraines?
Not everyone who gets frequent migraines needs treatment to prevent them. Sometimes
people can reduce the number of migraines they get by avoiding things that bring on
their attacks.

Common migraine 'triggers' include stress and certain foods, such as cheese, chocolate,
and citrus fruits.

You or your child can keep a diary to write down what your child does and eats each
day, and when they get migraines. This might help you work out whether certain foods,
certain activities, or stress trigger a migraine for your child.

However, your doctor might recommend medicines to prevent migraines if:


your child gets lots of bad migraines


your child's migraines stop them doing things: for example, they might be missing
school or not have enough time for their hobbies or friends



avoiding triggers hasn't helped enough.


What medicines are used to prevent migraines in children?
There are several medicines used to prevent migraines. Unfortunately, there isn't
much research looking at how well they work for children. As a result, doctors are
cautious about using these medicines in young people. They are usually prescribed
by a specialist.

There are three main medicines used to prevent migraines in children. If these don't
help, doctors sometimes prescribe other medicines, but this isn't common.



Propranolol is a type of medicine called a beta-blocker. It is mainly used for heart problems,
but it is also sometimes used for children and adults who get frequent migraines.



Pizotifen is a drug often used for preventing migraines in adults.



Topiramate is a type of drug called an anticonvulsant. It is mainly used for preventing seizures
but it is also sometimes used to prevent migraines.



All of these treatments can cause side effects. For example, some children have difficulty sleeping when taking propranolol. It can also cause breathing problems in some people, and it is not recommended for
children with asthma.

People taking pizotifen sometimes put on weight and feel drowsy, dizzy, or sick.

Topiramate can cause stomach pain, loss of appetite, problems sleeping, and mood changes, among
other side effects.

Your doctor should discuss the possible side effects of these medicines with you before
prescribing them to your child. If you have any questions or concerns about your child's
treatment, be sure to talk to your doctor.

If these medicines aren't suitable for your child, or if they don't work well enough,
there are other drugs that are sometimes used. But if your child needs any of these options
your doctor will want to monitor them regularly for side effects.

Your doctor should discuss these treatments with you carefully before you decide what's
best for your child.

How long will my child take the medicine?
Your child will take their medicine every day, but only for as long as they need it.
Their doctor will regularly review their treatment, and have them stop taking their
medicine for a while to see if their migraines return.

Children often stop getting migraines as they get older, or stop getting them as frequently."

If you're the parent of a child or teenager who gets migraines, you know how upsetting
these headaches can be. But there are treatments that can help. Also, doing simple
things, like managing stress, may reduce how many migraines your child gets.

You can use our information to talk to your doctor about the right treatments for
your child.

What are migraines in children and teenagers?
Migraines are very bad headaches. Your child might also get other symptoms, such as
feeling nauseous (sick) and seeing flashing lights (see below). Although migraines
are unpleasant, they are not dangerous. They don't mean that your child has a more
serious problem.

We don't know why some children get migraines. But certain things seem to bring on
a migraine in some people. These include:



feeling stressed (maybe because of an exam, or problems with friends)


eating certain foods, including cheese, chocolate, and citrus fruit


not drinking enough fluids, and


missing meals.


Girls may also be more likely to get migraines during their period.
What are the symptoms?
The main symptom is a bad headache. But migraines can be different from ordinary headaches
in several ways. For example:



a migraine headache can last hours to days. It might go away only when your child
sleeps.



migraines tend to be on just one side of the head.


a migraine may cause a pounding feeling, like someone banging a drum.


your child may feel worse if they try to do anything.


your child may feel nauseous and possibly vomit.


they may have double vision or blurred vision.


light or sound may hurt their head. They may need to lie down in a dark room.


Some people have warning signs before they get a migraine. These are called auras. Some examples are getting pins and needles, yawning a lot, or seeing zigzags or
flashing lights.

Things you can do
It’s helpful to learn what triggers your child's migraines. You or your child can
keep a diary to write down what your child does and eats each day, and when they get
migraines. This might help you work out whether certain foods, certain activities,
or stress trigger a migraine for your child.

One of the best ways to prevent migraine attacks is to learn to manage stress. There
are lots of ways to cope with stress.

Your child can learn relaxation techniques, or do yoga or regular exercise. You can
get books with advice about how to deal with stress. Or your child can see a therapist.

What treatments are available?
There are various treatments for migraines. But it's not clear how well some of them
work in children compared with adults.

If your child takes medicines for their migraines, make sure you follow the instructions
carefully to avoid possible problems. If your child takes pain medicine too often,
for example, they can actually get more headaches.

Medicines to treat migraine pain
Medicines for migraine pain work best if your child takes them as soon as they start
getting symptoms.

You can buy simple pain medicines, such as paracetamol and ibuprofen, from a pharmacy. Younger children can take these medicines as syrup.

Be careful not to give your child more paracetamol than is recommended. It can cause
serious liver damage if your child takes too much.

NOTE: no one under age 18 should take aspirin. It can cause a rare but dangerous problem called Reye's syndrome.

If ordinary pain medicines haven't helped, doctors sometimes prescribe codeine, which is a stronger pain reliever. However, it can cause more serious side effects,
such as dizziness and shortness of breath. It is usually recommended only for children
over age 12.

Doctors also sometimes prescribe a medicine called a triptan. Triptans work well to control migraine pain for many people. Children often take
triptans as a nasal spray, but they also come as tablets.

Triptans can have side effects. For example, your child may find that food tastes
different.

Medicines to stop your child feeling sick
Your child may also need medicine to stop them feeling sick. These are called anti-emetics.

As with pain medicines, anti-emetics best if your child takes it as soon as they start
getting symptoms. It may make your child feel sleepy.

Medicines to prevent migraines
If your child gets a lot of severe migraines, your doctor may recommend treatments
to prevent these attacks.

Unfortunately, there isn't much research on how well these medicines work in children.
And they will usually have to be prescribed by a specialist doctor. To read more,
see our leaflet Migraine in children: medicines to prevent attacks.

What to expect in the future?
Children who get migraines sometimes stop getting them when they get older. This is
more likely if your child started getting migraines before they reached puberty. Even
if your child's migraines don't go away, most people find that they become less severe
and less frequent when they get older."

Migraine headaches can cause severe pain, and sometimes nausea and vomiting. If they
happen regularly they can affect your quality of life. Migraines are common. About
1 in 5 people get a migraine at some point. But there are good treatments that can
help with pain and make your life easier.

What is it?
A migraine is a very severe headache. It may be so bad that all you feel like doing
is lying down in a dark room. One theory is that migraines happen when the blood vessels
in your brain swell up.

This swelling creates pressure in your brain, which causes pain. Although a migraine
can be unpleasant, getting one doesn't mean there's anything seriously wrong.

What are the symptoms?
If you get migraines you'll already know how bad they can be. Some people describe
a throbbing pain that gets worse when they move. You may also feel sick and vomit,
or be sensitive to light or noise. A migraine attack can last from a few hours to
a few days.

Some people get warning signs before they have a migraine. These are called auras. If you have an aura you might:



see flashing lights, which might block part of your field of vision


have ringing in your ears


feel numb in parts of your body


have trouble speaking.


Auras are not always followed by a headache, and some people who get auras never get
headaches.

What can trigger a migraine?
For some people, particular things seem to trigger a migraine. Common triggers include:


lack of sleep


hunger


stress, or


certain foods or drinks.


Some women find that they get migraines when their period starts.

Keeping a diary of your migraines could help you work out if there's anything that triggers them.
You could then try to avoid your trigger. For example, keep a snack with you if hunger
is a trigger.

If stress is a trigger you might want to learn some relaxation techniques, or try meditation
or yoga. If the trigger is something you can't avoid, at least you can make sure you
have your medicine with you.

It's helpful to learn to recognise the early signs of a migraine. You can then take
your medicine straight away. You could carry a bottle of water if you prefer the kind
of tablets that dissolve. Spotting an attack as it's coming on can also give you time
to find somewhere comfortable to rest.

What treatments work?
If you get migraines it is likely that you will keep getting them from time to time
throughout your life.

There is no cure for migraines that will stop them happening. But there are treatments
that can help with the pain so that you can get on with your life as quickly as possible.


Some people find that they can treat their symptoms without feeling that they need
to see a doctor. Other people need more help.

Medicines
The main treatments for migraines are medicines to deal with the pain. The important
thing to remember is to take the treatment you need as soon as you think you feel
a migraine coming on. The longer you delay:



the less likely the treatment is to work


the longer the migraine is likely to last


the more likely it is that you will feel sick.


There are several recommended treatments if you start having migraines. If none of
these treatments works for you, you can talk to your doctor about other options. These
first recommended treatments are:



paracetamol


ibuprofen


a tablet that contains a combination of paracetamol, aspirin, and caffeine


medicines called triptans.


Ibuprofen is a type of medicine called a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). You
can get different NSAIDs with a prescription from your doctor. People who have heart
problems should not take an NSAID called diclofenac.

Triptans are specially designed to treat migraines. Some of them might be available from a
pharmacy without a prescription.

As well as helping with pain, triptans may also help stop you feeling sick. Triptans
are generally used for more severe migraines. You shouldn't take triptans if you have
a heart condition or if you're pregnant.

Taking triptans along with some antidepressant drugs can also cause problems. If you
need to take antidepressants, talk to your doctor about the best migraine drug for
you.

Most side effects of triptans are mild and don't last long. A few people get pins
and needles, feel dizzy, or have a warm feeling in part of their body.

You need to be careful not to take painkillers too regularly. Taking them more than
two or three times a week can cause more headaches. This is because your body gets
used to the drug and you have a headache when you stop taking it.

Whichever medicine you take, don't take more than the recommended dose, as an overdose
can be dangerous. Aspirin or ibuprofen can irritate your stomach if you take them
a lot, but this shouldn't be a problem if you're only taking them occasionally.

You shouldn't give aspirin to children under 16.
If you feel too sick to swallow tablets when you have a migraine, ask your pharmacist
or doctor whether you can get your treatment as a tablet that dissolves in water or
in your mouth, or as a nasal spray, or a suppository (a capsule that you put up your
rectum).

If you need stronger treatments
If the treatments mentioned above don't help with your symptoms, talk to your doctor.
He or she may be able to prescribe stronger drugs, or combinations of drugs.

For example, they may recommend that you try a combination of an NSAID (such as ibuprofen)
and a triptan.

Your doctor may also prescribe treatments to take if you have a migraine and your
usual treatment fails to work. They might call this rescue medication.

Medicines for preventing migraines
Some people have migraines so often or that are so severe that doctors recommend they
take regular medicines to help prevent them. Your doctor may recommend this if you
have migraines more than twice a week.

If you take medicines to prevent migraines your doctor will probably recommend you
take them for at least four months.

If you are a woman and have severe migraines during your periods your doctor might
recommend medicines to stop you having periods for a while. This can help control
migraines.

There are several types of medicine that are usually used to treat other conditions
but that can be used to prevent migraines. Some of them are listed below. Different
types work better for different people.



Anticonvulsants are usually used to control seizures.



Antidepressants are usually used to help with conditions like depression and anxiety.



Beta blockers are usually used to treat high blood pressure and some heart conditions.



Most drug treatments are not recommended for migraines during pregnancy, but you can
take paracetamol. Or your doctor might recommend non-drug treatments. A 'talking treatment'
called cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) and relaxation therapy are two treatments
that are sometimes used.

These treatments might also be recommended for children, for women trying to get pregnant,
or for people who can't or don't want to take drugs to prevent migraines.

What will happen to me?
If you start to get migraines you're likely to get them fairly regularly. The average
is about one attack a month, but this varies a lot - you could get them a lot more
or a lot less.

Don't feel bad about having to take it easy or stay in bed when you get a migraine.
Most people say that they can't carry on with normal activities during an attack.


If you have migraines a lot more than once a month, or if your attacks are very bad,
you may want to ask your doctor about treatments to help prevent attacks."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1519009286788/Middle%20ear%20infection,Middle ear infection,"Middle ear infection Last published: Jan 05, 2023
Ear infections are common in children and can be painful. They usually get better
by themselves in a few days. Painkillers can help in the meantime. Some children may
be given antibiotics, but they are not usually needed.

What is middle ear infection?
Ear infections can happen after your child gets an infection like a cold or a sore
throat. The infection spreads down a tube called the eustachian tube, which connects your middle ear to the back of your nose. The middle ear is the part
of your ear behind your eardrum.

When the infection gets into your child's ears it makes them swollen, blocked, and
painful. Fluid builds up behind the eardrum. This makes it hard to hear and causes
pain.

Ear infections are very common, especially in young children.
Anyone can get an ear infection. But children are more likely than adults to get them.
Children who go to nursery or a play group are most likely to get them, because infections
spread easily among groups of children.

What are the symptoms?
The most common symptoms are ear pain and fever. Other symptoms can include:



Having trouble hearing


Vomiting, and


Fluid in the ears (if your child's eardrum tears).


Very young children won't be able to tell you they are in pain, or where it hurts.
And they might seem irritable and hard to settle.

older children might say they have pain elsewhere - for example, saying they have
a sore tummy. Your child might also rub or pull at their ear.

What treatments work?
Most children recover from ear infections in a few days. Painkillers can help in the
meantime. Some children might need antibiotics.

Medicines
Painkillers, such as paracetamol and ibuprofen, can't cure your child's ear infection. But they
can help to make your child feel better by relieving the pain. You can buy paracetamol
and ibuprofen for children at a pharmacy.

Note: children should never be given aspirin.
Antibiotics (drugs that kill bacteria) might help your child recover from an ear infection faster,
by about one day. But most children get better anyway without antibiotics.

Most doctors are now careful not to prescribe antibiotics unless a child definitely
needs them. This is because overuse of antibiotics is reducing how well they work.
This is called antibiotic resistance.

Your doctor might suggest what's sometimes called a wait-and-see prescription. This
means that the doctor gives you a prescription for antibiotics for your child, but
you wait a few days to see if your child gets better without them.

Most children get better during these few days. But if your child doesn't get better,
you can use the prescription.

Surgical treatments
If a child is in severe pain, or if the infection is not clearing up, your doctor
might suggest a procedure called tympanocentesis. This involves putting a needle into the ear drum to relieve the pressure, and sometimes
taking a sample of fluid to check for bacteria.

Doctors used to put small tubes called grommets into children’s ears, to try to prevent repeated ear infections. Grommets keep open
a hole in the eardrum, so fluid can drain out more easily.

This operation is still done for 'glue ear', which is when fluid gets trapped in the
ear and causes hearing problems. But there isn't much evidence that this treatment
helps prevent repeat infections.

What will happen to my child?
Most children who have an ear infection get better after two days to three days, whether
or not they have antibiotics.

A few children get repeated ear infections, or need another course of antibiotics.
But children tend to get fewer ear infections the older they get.

Ear infections can cause problems if they don't clear up properly. After an ear infection,
fluid can get trapped inside a child's ear (glue ear). It can stop the child hearing
properly, which can make learning difficult.

Rarely, an ear infection can spread to the large bone behind a child's ear. This can
cause severe pain, swelling, and tenderness behind the ear.

Having pneumococcal and flu vaccinations might help your child avoid ear infections.

If your child's ear infection doesn't get better in a couple of days, go back to your
doctor."

The menopause is when your periods stop for good. It isn't an illness but a normal
part of every woman's life. However, sometimes it causes symptoms that can be distressing.
You can get symptoms of the menopause for several years. But there are some treatments
that might help.

What happens in the menopause?
Your doctor will say you have gone through the menopause when you haven't had a period
for 12 months in a row.

You can get symptoms of the menopause long before your periods stop for good. This
is because the changes in your body that lead to the menopause start much earlier,
even as early as 10 years before your last period.

As you approach the menopause your ovaries make less of two important hormones: oestrogen
and progesterone. In the years before you reach the menopause you might notice that
your periods aren't as regular as they once were.

This is often one of the first signs that your hormone levels are changing. It usually
begins in your 40s and it can last for several years.

Eventually your ovaries make so little oestrogen and progesterone that your menstrual
cycle and your periods stop completely. This is the menopause.

You can’t get pregnant once your periods have stopped for good. But you should still
use contraception until you have not had a period for 12 months, just to be sure that
your periods have stopped completely.

Most women will go through their menopause between the ages of 45 and 55, but some
have an early menopause. Doctors say a woman has an early menopause when it happens
before she is 40.

Some women still have periods even when they're over 55. These women are said to have
a late menopause. Having a late menopause usually runs in families, but it can also
happen if you are overweight.

What are the symptoms?
Some women don’t have any problems when they go through the menopause. But most women
get at least one symptom. The severity of these symptoms can vary between mild and
very distressing.

Some symptoms, such as hot flushes, are caused directly by changes in your hormones.
But other changes might be affected by other things going on in your life.

For example, you might find it hard when your children leave home, or you might have
to look after elderly parents. Things like this can make the changes that the menopause
brings harder to deal with.

Irregular periods can be an early sign of the menopause. You might find your periods
are lighter than before, or heavier. They might last longer, or just a few days, and
they might be more or less frequent.

All of these things are normal. But if you have very heavy periods (needing to change
pads or tampons every hour) or if you get bleeding after sex or ‘spotting’ mid-cycle,
see your doctor.

These are common symptoms of the menopause:


Hot flushes, where you suddenly feel hot and might go red in the face. They might
be mild, or bad enough to wake you at night. Some women find that hot flushes can
be triggered by caffeine, spicy foods, hot drinks, or alcohol.



Night sweats, usually caused by hot flushes at night. But night sweats can be caused
by other things, like an infection, so see your doctor if you get them.



Symptoms caused by the lining of your vagina becoming drier and thinner during the
menopause. This can cause itching and make sex painful.



Losing interest in sex.


Problems sleeping. You might find it hard to get to sleep, wake up because of hot
flushes, or wake up very early and be unable to get back to sleep.



Putting on weight and other physical changes, such as a loss of muscle tone and increased
fat around your middle. Doctors don’t know if this is because of hormone changes or
just part of getting older.



Feeling low or depressed, or having mood swings. These negative feelings can include
being irritable, anxious, panicky, and forgetful.



Your doctor will usually be able to tell from your symptoms and your age whether you
are going through the menopause. But if you are younger than 40 you might need a blood
test (called the FSH test) to find out for sure.

What will happen to me?
Women experience the menopause in different ways. You might sail through the menopause
with few problems or you might have severe symptoms that affect your quality of life.

Your experience of the menopause might depend on what else is going on in your life.
You might find it more difficult to cope with if you're under stress for other reasons.

Your feelings about this time in your life will affect how you experience the menopause.
Some women see the menopause as a positive step in moving on to the next stage of
life. Other women feel anxious or depressed about the physical changes.

Some women choose to take hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to help with menopausal
symptoms. Many women find this helpful but it can cause side effects. For more information
see our leaflet Menopause: should I take HRT?

Once you have been through the menopause it’s important to look after your health,
especially to keep your bones strong and look after your heart. You can do this by:



eating a balanced diet with plenty of fruit and vegetables and plenty of calcium (found
in dairy products)



limiting alcohol to moderate levels


maintaining a healthy weight


not smoking


doing regular exercise, including weight-bearing exercise like walking or jogging."

The menopause is the name for when your menstrual periods stop for good. It isn't
an illness, just a normal stage in every woman's life. But sometimes it causes symptoms
that can be distressing. You can get symptoms of the menopause for several years.


Treatments for the symptoms of the menopause include hormone replacement therapy (HRT).
This can work well, but it increases your chances of some serious health problems.
So you need to think carefully about whether or not to take it.

How do I decide?
Your doctor should be sure that you understand the risks of HRT, if you are thinking
of taking it. These are some of the things you might want to consider and discuss
with your doctor:



How much do your menopause symptoms bother you?


Can HRT help with the symptoms that bother you most?


Which type of HRT is likely to work best for these symptoms?


Are there alternatives to HRT for these symptoms?


Do some ways of taking HRT have fewer side effects than others?


What are the health risks with taking HRT?


Are you at high risk or low risk of getting health problems from HRT?


How long will you need to take HRT?


What side effects might you get with HRT?


What happens in the menopause?
As you approach the menopause your body makes less of two hormones, oestrogen and
progesterone. Among other things, these hormones control when you have a period. You
may notice changes to your periods. They might be heavier, or lighter, and last for
more or fewer days than usual.

Many women have hot flushes when they go through the menopause. When this happens
you suddenly feel hot and you may go red in the face. It's also common to find that
your vagina feels dry and uncomfortable, which may make sex painful. Both of these
symptoms are caused by changes in your hormone levels.

Other symptoms include having trouble sleeping, feeling depressed, gaining weight,
and having less interest in sex. These things might be caused by changes to your hormones,
or by changes to your life around the time of the menopause.

Not everyone needs treatment for symptoms of the menopause - some women find the symptoms
don't bother them much. But other women find the symptoms more distressing. If you
are worried by your symptoms you can talk to your doctor about treatments.

What is HRT?
HRT stands for hormone replacement therapy. (It's sometimes just called hormone therapy,
or HT.) It's a type of medicine that contains the hormone oestrogen.

The aim of HRT is to replace some of the oestrogen that your body stops making when
you reach the menopause. This is because the drop in oestrogen at the menopause causes
symptoms such as hot flushes and vaginal dryness.

Many women take a combination of oestrogen and a substance called progestin. Progestin
is designed to mimic the effects of the hormone progesterone.

There are different ways of taking HRT. You can take it as a skin patch, a tablet,
a gel, an implant, or a vaginal cream or ring. Some types work best for certain symptoms.
If you decide to take HRT, you can talk to your doctor about which product is likely
to suit you best.

Depending on what type of HRT you take, you might be able to take it in a way that
copies your natural cycle and gives you a period. This is called cyclical HRT. It's
often prescribed for women who are having menopausal symptoms but who are still having
periods.

Or you can take HRT every day without a break and have no period. This is called continuous
HRT. It's more suitable for women who haven't had periods for a year or more.

How can HRT help?
HRT can help relieve several symptoms of the menopause, including:


hot flushes


vaginal symptoms such as dryness and pain during sex


urinary infections that can be caused by dryness.


Taking HRT also offers other benefits, such as reducing your chances of bone fractures.
HRT for hot flushes
HRT is highly effective in reducing hot flushes. Many women find that it cuts the
number of hot flushes they have by up to 90 percent (nine out of ten).

But HRT can increase your chances of some serious problems, including stroke, deep
vein thrombosis (DVT), and breast cancer. So doctors recommend that women who take
HRT have the lowest possible dose for the shortest possible time.

Women who have not had a hysterectomy (who still have a uterus) are usually prescribed
HRT that also contains progestin. This seems to offer protection against cancer of
the uterus (also called womb cancer or endometrial cancer).

Oestrogen therapy on its own is usually only offered to women who have had a hysterectomy
(an operation to remove the uterus) or who don't have a uterus.

HRT for vaginal and urinary symptoms
The menopause can cause several vaginal symptoms, including vaginal dryness, urinary
tract infections (UTIs), and other problems with urination.

For women who have some of the vaginal symptoms of menopause without hot flushes,
doctors prefer to prescribe HRT treatments that are applied directly in the vagina
rather than tablets that you take by mouth.

This reduces the chances of side effects. These locally applied treatments also seem
to work better than pills at relieving urinary symptoms such as infections.

HRT for vaginal symptoms can be taken as a cream, as pessaries (tablets that dissolve
when placed in the vagina), or as a small, flexible ring placed inside the vagina.
This ring gradually releases the HRT medication into the vagina for three months,
after which you replace it with a new one.

Many women who take HRT using these methods find that they get relief from the vaginal
symptoms of menopause, including the vaginal dryness that can make sex painful.

HRT for sleep problems and mood symptoms
Some women find that their menopausal symptoms cause disturbed sleep (partly because
of hot flushes at night), while some women find that they have problems with their
mood, such as depression.

We don't know whether the insomnia that affects some women at the menopause is caused
directly by hormonal changes. But HRT does seem to help some women sleep better.

If you find you become depressed during or just after the menopause, talk to your
doctor. It is possible that hormonal changes are the cause.

Women with symptoms of depression are most likely to benefit from HRT if they are
currently going through the menopause. After the menopause, antidepressant medicines
are more likely to help with depression linked to menopause.

Can HRT be harmful?
Research has highlighted two main areas where HRT can increase the chance of serious
problems. These are:



heart and circulation problems, such as heart disease, stroke, and deep vein thrombosis
(DVT). A DVT is a blood clot in a vein. These usually happen in the leg. If you have
a blood clot in your leg that travels to your lung it can be very dangerous.



breast cancer.


For most women the increases in the risks of these conditions are very small. But
you should talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits for you as an individual.

Some women feel that the risks that come with HRT are too great, while other women
feel that their menopausal symptoms are making their lives so miserable that they
are willing to accept those risks. You can discuss all these issues with your doctor
before deciding whether HRT is right for you.

Heart and circulation problems
The effects of HRT on heart and circulation problems are complicated. It's not simply
a case of HRT increasing the chance of problems. For example, research suggests that
HRT increases your chance of a stroke or DVT, but that starting HRT less than 10 years
after the menopause actually offers some protection against heart disease.

Cancer
Taking HRT slightly increases your chances of being diagnosed with breast cancer.
Once you stop taking HRT your chances of getting breast cancer falls. Within a few
years of stopping HRT your chance of getting breast cancer is the same as it was before
you took HRT.

HRT is considered safer for women who have no history of breast cancer in their family,
or of DVT. But this doesn't mean that women with a history of those conditions can't
take HRT.

Other side effects
Taking HRT for a year or more could increase your risk of gallbladder disease (gallstones)
or urinary incontinence.

You may also get less-serious side effects with HRT. Sometimes they go away when you
have been on HRT for a while. Sometimes a change of product helps.

These side effects include unexpected bleeding, tender breasts, headaches, and mood
swings. Some women put on a little weight when they first start HRT. But this doesn't
last and most women's weight soon returns to what it was before they started HRT.

What are the alternatives?
There are some things you can do that might make hot flushes easier to deal with.
For example, you could try avoiding spicy foods, warm environments, and things that
cause you stress. You could also try wearing layered clothing and drinking cold water.

Many doctors also recommend regular exercise for women during menopause. It might
not help with specific symptoms, but it contributes to general wellbeing. Exercise
can also help with weight loss, which can help relieve menopausal symptoms in some
women.

There are also some non-HRT treatments that may help with hot flushes. Some are prescription
medicines while others are supplements you can buy over the counter. They are unlikely
to work as well as HRT. But you can talk to your doctor about them if you would rather
not take HRT.

Antidepressants are usually used to treat depression, but some of them can help reduce hot flushes.
But antidepressants can cause side effects in some people, including nausea, dizziness,
and a reduced interest in sex.

Gabapentin is a drug normally used to treat epilepsy and neuropathic pain (pain caused by problems
with your nerves). But it can help reduce hot flushes. Gabapentin can cause side effects,
including dizziness and drowsiness.

Clonidine is a drug usually used to treat high blood pressure. It can help reduce hot flushes,
but it can cause side effects, including lowering your blood pressure too much. If
you use this treatment your doctor should regularly monitor your blood pressure.

Phyto-oestrogens are chemicals found in some plants. They act like a weak form of oestrogen. Soya
products such as tofu and miso are rich in phyto-oestrogens, as are beans, lentils,
certain fruits, and celery. You can also buy them as supplements. But it's unclear
whether phyto-oestrogens help to relieve symptoms of the menopause, and whether they
might cause the same problems as HRT.

You should always tell your doctor if you're taking herbal treatments at the same
time as prescription medicines, as some combinations of treatments are not safe."

Meningitis and septicaemia are life-threatening illnesses. It is very important to
get treatment immediately. This information is about meningitis and septicaemia caused
by bacteria called meningococcus. It doesn't look at meningitis from other causes.

What are meningitis and septicaemia?
Meningitis and septicaemia are medical emergencies. If you think you or someone you are with has symptoms of these conditions, get medical
help straight away.

You get meningitis when germs called bacteria infect the fluid in your spinal cord
and around your brain. If the bacteria get into your blood it can also cause blood
poisoning, which is called septicaemia.

Several kinds of germs cause meningitis, including viruses and bacteria. This information
looks at meningitis and septicaemia caused by meningococcus bacteria.

You might also hear these infections called meningococcal disease.

When someone is infected the bacteria live in their nose and throat and can be spread
through coughs and sneezes. You can have meningitis or septicaemia separately or both
at the same time.

People with a greater chance of being infected include:


children aged under 5 years


young adults aged 16 to 21


university students living in halls of residence


children whose parents smoke, and


people aged 65 and over.


Children in many countries are routinely vaccinated against some types of meningitis,
including meningococcal disease. But these bacteria still cause infections every year.


What are the symptoms?
It’s really important to know the symptoms of meningococcal meningitis and septicaemia.
The sooner you spot the symptoms and get treatment the more likely you are to recover
well.

Both meningitis and septicaemia usually cause:


a high temperature (fever)


sleepiness (including feeling lethargic or having difficulty waking up), and


a rash.


Symptoms come on quickly, getting worse within a few hours.
People with meningococcal disease sometimes get a particular kind of rash. Unlike
most rashes it doesn’t go away when you press it. So if you press a glass against
it you can see it through the glass. But not everyone gets a rash.

If you have meningitis, you might also have:


a headache


a stiff neck


nausea (feeling sick) or vomiting


loss of appetite


pain looking at bright lights


confusion or difficulty thinking clearly


seizures (fits).


If you have septicaemia, you might also:


have cold hands and feet


have pale or mottled skin


feel shivery


have very rapid breathing


feel thirsty


have painful joints and muscles.


Babies and children under 2 may not have these symptoms. Instead they might:


be slow, sleepy, or irritable


vomit, or feed poorly


cry a lot (sometimes this sounds like moaning or high-pitched crying)


have a fever, but look pale or blotchy


have a bulging soft spot (fontanelle) on their head


be stiff or jerky, or have seizures (fits).


If you or your child has symptoms get medical help straight away. Do not delay. Go to the nearest accident and emergency department or call for an
ambulance immediately, whatever time of day or night.

You will need blood tests and possibly other tests to find out whether you have meningitis.
But treatment should be started immediately, before the test results.

What treatments work?
The usual treatment for meningococcal disease is antibiotics. If you get treatment
quickly you have a better chance of recovering.

Medicines
If doctors think you have meningococcal disease you'll be given antibiotics through
an intravenous drip (IV) into your arm. You might be given them on the way to hospital.

It can be difficult to know for certain whether someone has meningococcal disease.
Doctors usually start people on antibiotics right away without waiting for the results
of tests, because it's so important to start treatment quickly.

Doctors sometimes give injections of medicines called steroids, as well as antibiotics,
for meningococcal meningitis. This may prevent nerve damage.

Treating other people
If you've been in close contact with someone who has meningococcal disease, your doctor
will recommend that you take antibiotic tablets, to stop you catching it. You should
start them as soon as possible, usually within a day.

Close contact means that, in the seven days before the person you knew got meningococcal
disease, you could have been infected by bacteria from their mouth or nose. For example,
you:



lived in the same house as them


shared a school dormitory with them


were their boyfriend, girlfriend, or partner


shared a kitchen in a university hall of residence with them.


What will happen to me?
Most people who get meningococcal disease recover. But between 10 and 15 in every
100 people will die. And between 10 and 20 in 100 of those who recover will have some
kind of complication, such as some hearing loss, muscle and movement problems, blindness,
seizures, or mental retardation.

Some people also have problems with blood circulation and need to have operations
such as skin grafts and finger amputations.

If you or your child has had meningococcal disease, your doctor should arrange for
regular checks to look for signs of complications. For example, spotting hearing loss
as early as possible in young children is important, so that they get treatment quickly
and avoid speech problems as they grow."

The main symptom of Ménière's disease is sudden attacks of dizziness. There is no
cure for this condition but there are treatments that might help relieve some of the
symptoms.

What is Ménière's disease?
Ménière's disease is a condition that affects the inner ear. The inner ear plays an
important part in our sense of balance. Ménière's disease causes attacks of dizziness
and hearing loss.

We don't know exactly why people get Ménière's disease. It might happen if you have
too much of a fluid called lymph in your inner ear.

What are the symptoms?
During attacks of Ménière's disease you lose some hearing and feel as if the room
is spinning. You might also have a roaring or buzzing sound in your ears (tinnitus)
or feel pressure in your ears.

These attacks can last from 20 minutes to several hours. When they happen you might
feel sick, vomit, or need to lie down. Afterwards you might feel tired or unsteady.

Some people get attacks every few weeks while others don't have them for months at
a time.

Between attacks your hearing might be fine. Symptoms can start in just one ear, but
after months or years you might get symptoms in both ears.

Make sure you see a doctor if you get hearing loss or dizziness. Several other things
can cause these symptoms, such as anaemia, an ear infection, or, rarely, a tumour.


What treatments work?
There is no cure for Ménière's disease and research has so far not provided many clear
answers about what treatments work best. But there are several things you can try.

Some treatments are aimed at helping with your symptoms during an attack. Others are
aimed at preventing further attacks.

Treatments to prevent attacks
The two main treatments recommended for preventing attacks of Ménière's disease are:


eating a low-salt diet


taking medicines called diuretics.


Reducing salt is thought to help because salt helps your body to retain water. Extra water in your
body might cause swelling in the lymphatic system, which, in turn, could mean that
extra lymph in your inner ear could cause an attack.

There isn't much evidence to support this approach. But some people with Ménière's
disease say that they have an attack after eating a salty meal. Your doctor can advise
you about safe ways to achieve a low-salt diet. He or she might refer you to a dietitian
for more advice.

Some people also say that attacks can be triggered by smoking, drinking alcohol, and
by food and drinks high in caffeine (such as coffee, tea, and chocolate).

So doctors advise that people with Ménière's disease should stop smoking and try to
avoid alcohol and caffeine. Managing stress might also help prevent attacks.

Drugs called diuretics help your body to get rid of extra fluid in your urine. The hope is that these drugs
will work in the same way as eating a low-salt diet.

Diuretics can have side effects in some people. These include stomach upsets, dizziness,
or a rash.

Treatments for specific symptoms
Treatments for vertigo
Vertigo is the feeling of dizziness that happens during an attack of Ménière's disease.
Various treatments have been tried to reduce vertigo during an attack. These include:



antihistamines. These drugs are usually used to treat allergies, but they can help
with vertigo and with the nausea that can go with it.



benzodiazepines. These medicines are usually used to help people with anxiety or who
have trouble sleeping, but they can be used to relieve vertigo.

These drugs are not likely to be the first treatment you are offered as they can cause
side effects. You should only be prescribed them for a short time as they can be addictive.




corticosteroids. These drugs are usually used to treat inflammation (swelling) and
breathing problems such as asthma. It is thought that they might help with Ménière's
disease by reducing swelling and pressure in the inner ear.



anti-emetics. These drugs don't relieve vertigo, but they can reduce the nausea you
might feel during an attack.



All of these drugs can cause side effects in some people, and they might not all be
suitable for you. In particular, many of these medications can cause drowsiness. You
can discuss with your doctor which treatment is best for you.

Treatments for tinnitus
Tinnitus doesn't damage your health but it can be extremely distressing. Tinnitus
can be any persistent internal noise in the ear, such as whistling or buzzing. In
people with Ménière's disease it's usually a deep roaring or buzzing.

Some people don't find it too troublesome. But if you have severe tinnitus there are
several things you can try, including:



tinnitus maskers. These are devices similar to hearing aids, which fit behind the
ear. They work by making a low-level 'white noise' that distracts you from the internal
tinnitus noise.



tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT). This involves counselling to help you change the
way you think about your tinnitus. The idea is that, in time, it will bother you less
and you won't notice it as much. Many people find this treatment helpful, but it can
be many months before you notice a benefit.



hearing aids. Some people find that using hearing aids helps to mask the tinnitus
noise.



biofeedback. This therapy uses relaxation and other techniques, such as hypnotism
and a 'talking treatment' called cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) to help people
cope with severe tinnitus.



antidepressants. These drugs, which are usually used to treat depression, can help
people cope with the distress caused by tinnitus. But your doctor will probably only
suggest them if other treatments haven't worked, as they can cause side effects.



Treatments for hearing loss
The usual treatment for sudden hearing loss is corticosteroids, either as tablets
or as ear drops.

You could also talk to your doctor about trying hearing aids. Doctors used to think
that hearing aids wouldn't work for hearing loss caused by Ménière's disease. But
modern digital hearing aids work much better than older types.

You could also try an assistive listening device. This is a machine about the size
of a small phone, which you use with headphones to help you to hear in noisy environments.
You use it when needed for occasional bouts of hearing loss.

Long-term treatments
There are several other treatments for several symptoms of Ménière's disease. You
can talk with your doctor about whether they might be right for you.

Injections in the ear
With this treatment, medicines are injected into the middle ear. Its medical name
is intratympanic therapy.

One of the medicine types used is corticosteroids, which reduces swelling in the ear.
Doctors sometimes also give antibiotic injections in the ear. This seems to reduce
vertigo and hearing loss in some people.

The Meniett device
The Meniett device is a small handheld device with a tube attached that fits into
the ear. It delivers pulses of pressure through the ear canal. You use it three times
a day. For this device to work you need to have a minor procedure to insert a small
tube called a grommet (or tympanostomy tube) into the ear. The grommet stays in the
ear.

Doctors aren't sure exactly why the Meniett device seems to work. But it seems to
reduce attacks of vertigo in some people. You can talk with your doctor about whether
it might suit you.

Surgery
Surgery is usually a last resort with Ménière's disease, when nothing else has worked.
There are several procedures that can be tried.

The one that's right for you will depend on how bad your attacks are, how good your
hearing is, your age and general health, and which treatment you would prefer.

If you have fairly good hearing your doctor might suggest a procedure called decompression,
which aims to reduce pressure in the ear without affecting your hearing.

If your hearing has already been badly affected, your doctor might suggest an operation
to remove the part of the inner ear that is the source of your attacks. This will
mean that you can't hear in that ear any more.

Balance therapy
The full name for this treatment is vestibular and balance rehabilitation therapy.
It is recommended for people who have problems with balance. It uses head and body
exercises to help you cope with vertigo.

What will happen to me?
The symptoms of Ménière's disease usually come and go. But it's likely that your symptoms
will slowly get worse over time. Your hearing is likely to get worse in the long term.

But the course of Ménière's disease varies from person to person. Some people find
that their symptoms don't get any worse. It's impossible to say what will happen to
you as an individual.

Ménière's disease can mean you might have difficulty travelling or doing some kinds
of work. Your doctor can give you advice about making your home or workplace safer,
or when to avoid driving.

If you have a driving licence, you need to tell the relevant authorities (for example,
in most of the UK it's the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency [DVLA]) that you have
Ménière's disease."

The MenB vaccine is given to babies in several doses. It’s designed to protect against
infection with a bacteria called Neisseria meningitidis group B. This bacteria can cause fatal illnesses including meningitis.

What is meningococcal group B infection?
MenB is one of several types of meningococcal bacterial infections. It is extremely dangerous
For example, in the UK, MenB bacterial infections kill more babies and young children
than any other infectious disease.

MenB infection can cause serious illnesses, including:


meningitis and



sepsis (a dangerously extreme reaction in the body to an infection).



The most well-known of these conditions among parents is probably meningitis. Meningitis is inflammation (swelling) of the tissues that protect the brain and spinal cord.
These tissues are called the meninges.

This type of infection is not always caused by bacteria. Meningitis can also be caused
by infection with a virus or, rarely, a fungus. But these types of infections are
usually less serious.

Meningitis can sometimes be fatal. And people who recover are often affected for the
rest of their lives. Long-term problems caused by meningitis can include:



severe brain damage


hearing or vision problems


epilepsy


problems with memory and concentration


problems with movement and balance, and


needing to have limbs amputated.


Who needs the MenB vaccination?
For the best protection, babies need several doses of the MenB vaccine.
Vaccination schedules might vary slightly between countries. For example, in the UK,
babies have three doses of the vaccine. This happens at the ages of:



eight weeks


16 weeks, and


one year.


Is there anyone who shouldn’t have the vaccine?
Very rarely, a baby might have a severe allergic reaction to the vaccine. But the
vaccination staff will have been trained to deal with this.

You should tell the medical staff giving the vaccine about any allergies your child
has.

Is it safe?
The MenB vaccine is fairly new compared with many other vaccines. But it has been
given to millions of children, and no safety concerns have been found.

Even so, as with all vaccines, there can be side effects in some children.
The most common side effect is that this vaccine tends to cause a fever within 24 hours. To help prevent this, or to make it less severe, it’s important
to give your baby liquid paracetamol.

The medical staff giving the vaccination should give you information at your appointment
about how and when to give the paracetamol to your child.

As always with liquid paracetamol, it’s important to:


not give more than the recommended dose, and


never give it alongside other medicines that contain paracetamol.


Other side effects of the MenB vaccine can include:


pain, swelling, or redness where the injection was given (called the injection site)


diarrhoea or vomiting


crying and irritability, and


a mild allergic reaction to the vaccine. This can cause a rash or itching.


How is the vaccination given?
The vaccine is given as an injection into your baby’s thigh, or into the upper arm
in children over the age of one year.

How well does the vaccine work?
The MenB vaccine is much newer than some vaccines that have been around for a long
time. So there is less evidence about it than for more established vaccines.

But the evidence so far suggests that the vaccine protects against most types of MenB
bacteria, and that vaccination programmes reduce cases of meningitis and sepsis by
about two thirds."

The MenACWY vaccine is a single injection that’s designed to protect against four
strains of meningococcal bacteria: types A, C, W, and Y.

Meningococcal bacteria can cause fatal infections including meningitis and sepsis.
What is meningococcal infection?
There are several types of meningococcal infection. The MenACWY vaccine protects against
four of them: types A, C, W, AND Y.

Meningococcal infections are extremely dangerous.

They can cause serious, often fatal illnesses, including:


meningitis and



sepsis (a dangerously extreme reaction in the body to an infection).



The most well-known of these conditions among parents is probably meningitis. Meningitis is inflammation (swelling) of the tissues that protect the brain and spinal cord.
These tissues are called the meninges.

severe brain damage


hearing or vision problems


epilepsy


problems with memory and concentration


problems with movement and balance, and


needing to have limbs amputated.


To learn more about meningitis, and about what symptoms to look out for, see our leaflet:
Meningitis and septicaemia.

Who needs the MenACWY vaccine?
Teenagers
In many countries, including the UK, vaccinations against various types of meningococcal
disease start when people are babies.

For example, in the UK, by the age of 12 months, babies should have had three doses
of meningococcal group B vaccine, and one dose of group C vaccine.

The MenACWY vaccine is usually offered to older children, at the age of about 14 years, as part of vaccination programmes in schools.

Young adults
But the MenACWY vaccine hasn’t been in use as long as some more established vaccines,
such as the polio vaccine. So it’s possible that some young people might have missed
having the vaccine at school.

This means that, depending on where you live, you might be offered the vaccine later
in your school career. You can still have the MenACWY vaccine up to the age of 25 years old.

In some countries it’s recommended that young people about to start higher education (for example, university) should check if they have had the MenACWY vaccine.

Vaccinating new university students is important, because starting at university often
involves mixing closely with a lot of people, some of whom might be carrying meningococcal
bacteria without knowing it.

If you’re about to start higher education, check if you need to have the MenACWY vaccine.
Other groups
The MenACWY vaccine might be recommended for other reasons, such as making the Hajj
or Umrah pilgrimage, or visiting countries where there is a high risk of meningococcal
disease.

In these situations, you might need a booster if it is more than five years since
your last vaccination.

Is there anyone who shouldn’t have the vaccine?
You shouldn’t have the MenACWY vaccine if you:


have had an allergic reaction to a previous dose of a meningitis vaccine, or


are allergic to any of its ingredients. Tell the medical staff giving the vaccine
about any allergies you have.



You should also check with the medical staff before having the vaccination if you:


have haemophilia, or other health problems linked to bleeding or easy bruising


have a fever. You will probably be advised to arrange to have the vaccine once your
fever has cleared up



are pregnant or breastfeeding.


Is it safe?
Like all vaccines, the MenACWY vaccine can cause side effects in some people. These
are usually mild and rarely last longer than a day or two. These include:



redness and itching where the injection was given (called the injection site). Some
people get a small lump that can last for several days or weeks



fatigue


fever


headache, and


nausea.


How is the vaccination given?
MenACWY is given as a single injection into the upper arm.
How well does the vaccine work?
The vaccine gives very good protection against the four strains of meningitis that
it is designed to protect against.

For example, in countries with good vaccination programmes, meningitis is now extremely
rare."

Last published: Mar 14, 2022
MMR stands for measles, mumps, and rubella (rubella is also sometimes called German
measles). Giving your child the MMR vaccine protects them against these diseases.

What are measles, mumps, and rubella?
Measles, mumps, and rubella used to be quite common in childhood. They’re much less
common now because most children are routinely vaccinated against them.

If you haven’t had measles, mumps, or rubella when you were a child, and if you haven’t
been vaccinated against them, you can get these diseases when you’re older.

Are they serious?
Measles


Measles causes a mild, red rash, a fever, runny nose, and sore eyes.


It can cause temporary complications, such as convulsions (fits) and diarrhoea.


It can lead to other infections, such as ear infections and pneumonia.


Rarely, measles can cause permanent brain damage and death.


Mumps


Mumps causes swollen and painful glands in the neck, as well as aches, pains, and
tiredness.



Mumps can cause swelling in the brain, which can sometimes make walking difficult
and can lead to behaviour problems.



In boys and men mumps can lead to painful swelling of the testicles, which can make
it difficult to father a child.



Mumps has been linked to hearing loss and arthritis.


In rare cases mumps can be fatal. This is more common if you get the disease as an
adult.



Rubella


Rubella causes a rash and swollen glands. But you can have it without having any symptoms.


Rubella is most harmful to pregnant women. This is because it can cause miscarriage
or serious defects in the baby, such as deafness and heart problems.



Your baby is most likely to be affected if you catch rubella early in your pregnancy
(before 11 weeks).



Why does my child need the MMR vaccine?
The MMR vaccine protects children from getting measles, mumps, and rubella. Vaccinated
children have less chance of getting the diseases and of getting complications from
them.

Having your child vaccinated may help to eventually put an end to measles, mumps,
and rubella. To get rid of a disease altogether, as many people as possible need to
be vaccinated. It is thought that 95 in every 100 people in a community need to be
vaccinated against a disease for there to be what's called herd immunity.

Herd immunity is when people who haven’t been vaccinated against a disease are protected
from it because most people are vaccinated and can’t pass it on. If you or your child
are not vaccinated then you increase the chances that the diseases will stay in the
community.

How is the MMR vaccine given?
The MMR vaccine is given in two injections. The first injection is given when your
child is between 12 and 15 months old. The second injection is given between the ages
of 3 and 6 years.

Why are two injections needed?
Not everyone responds to the MMR vaccine the first time they have the injection. After
the first dose of the MMR vaccine about 5 in 100 children will not be protected against
the diseases. But after two doses less than 1 in 100 children are still not protected.


How well does it work?
The MMR vaccine works very well. Very few children who have this vaccine catch measles,
mumps, or rubella.

Is the MMR vaccine suitable for all children?
Some children should not have the MMR vaccine, or should wait. Check with your doctor
if your child:



is very ill when he or she is due to have the vaccine


has HIV/AIDS or another disease that affects his or her immune system


is being treated with drugs that affect the immune system or has been treated with
a blood product in the past three months



has cancer or is being treated for it


has had a severe allergic reaction to the antibiotic neomycin.


Are there side effects?
Your child may get some mild side effects from the vaccine, such as a fever. Some
children become irritable, get a skin rash, or get swollen glands. A small number
of children have convulsions (fits). Children usually recover quickly from these effects.
There’s no evidence that the MMR vaccine can cause long-term harm.

What about the link with autism?
In 1998 a study raised questions about the MMR vaccine and autism. This study was
later found to contain many mistakes and was withdrawn by the medical journal that
published it.

Many other studies have looked at whether there is a link between the MMR vaccine
and autism. None of these studies found any a link.

There is no evidence of any link between the MMR vaccine and autism.
What will happen if my child does not have the MMR vaccine?
Your child will be more likely to get measles, mumps, and rubella, and the complications
they can cause.

Should I have the MMR vaccine if I’m planning to get pregnant?
If you have ever had measles, mumps, or rubella, or if you have had the vaccines,
your unborn baby will not be harmed by that virus if you come into contact with it
again.

If you find out that you are not protected against rubella while you are pregnant
you need to wait until after you’ve had your baby to have the MMR vaccine. You can
have this a few days after your baby is born. Your doctor can advise you about the
best time to do this."

If you have developed mastitis, you've probably already been breastfeeding for at
least a few weeks.

Some health professionals think that mastitis often happens because babies aren't
breastfeeding properly, but we don't know this for sure.

But you might find it helpful to look at how your are breastfeeding, either to check
if there's anything you could change that might help, or just to reassure you that
you're doing nothing wrong.

Here we describe what position you and your baby should be in when breastfeeding,
and the signs that tell you that your baby is feeding properly. To read more about
mastitis and its treatment, see the leaflet Mastitis in breastfeeding women.

The first thing you need to do is get into a comfortable position. Make sure you’re sitting down with enough room to stretch your arms out to the elbows.
Use cushions if you need extra back support. Remember you’ll be in this position a
lot, and maybe for a long time.

Once you’re comfortable you need to get your baby in a good position for feeding:




Hold your baby close to you with their body facing your chest


Your baby’s head and body should be in a straight line


Make sure your baby’s arm does not get in the way


Keep your baby’s head and neck well supported but leave enough room to tilt their
head back



Hold your baby so their nose is level with your nipple and close enough to get a big
mouthful of breast



Keep your baby’s nose free for breathing (do not push it into your breast)


You may find it helps to hold your breast from underneath, by making a C-shape with
your thumb and forefinger.



The next thing you need to do is to get your baby to latch onto your breast. Your
baby might do this without you having to do anything. But if your baby seems reluctant,
then you may need to encourage them.

Try teasing your baby’s lips with the nipple to get them to open their mouth. As your
baby opens their mouth, push your breast towards it with your nipple facing towards
the roof of their mouth. If your baby does not want to feed, then stop and try again
a bit later.

When your baby is properly attached you should notice the following:


Your baby’s mouth is wide open


You can see the coloured skin around the nipple. You should see more of this above
your baby’s mouth and less underneath their chin



Your baby’s chin is touching your breast


Your baby’s lower lip is rolled down


Your baby’s nose is free.


It's normal to feel some discomfort when you start to breastfeed. Your nipples may
be sore and your breasts may feel very heavy and full, especially when your milk first
comes in. This usually happens about three days after you give birth. But you shouldn't
be in a lot of pain. If you are, ask a health professional about it.

There are certain signs that will tell you that your baby is feeding properly:


You should be able to hear and see your baby swallowing


Your baby should have a rhythmic suck


Your baby’s arms and hands should be relaxed


Your baby’s mouth should be moist


Your baby should have regular soaked and heavy nappies


Your breast should feel softer as your baby feeds


Breastfeeding your baby should make you feel relaxed and even sleepy."

Mastitis is common in women who are breastfeeding and it can be extremely painful.
It often clears up on its own, but sometimes it needs to be treated with antibiotics.

What is mastitis?
Mastitis happens when your breast tissue becomes inflamed (swollen). It most often
affects women who are breastfeeding.

You get mastitis when milk builds up in the tubes, called ducts, that carry milk to
your nipple. If a duct gets blocked, milk is forced into the breast tissue surrounding
it. This causes inflammation.

If germs get into the milk duct and breast tissue, you can get a more severe form
of mastitis called infective mastitis. Germs such as bacteria can get into your breast
by travelling up the milk ducts from the nipple. This is more likely if you have cracks
or sores on your nipples.

Anything that causes milk to collect in your breast for longer than usual, such as
your baby starting to sleep through the night, can increase your chance of getting
mastitis.

Mastitis usually happens during the first couple of months after giving birth, although
it can happen any time you are breastfeeding.

What are the symptoms?
Mastitis usually starts quite suddenly and can be very painful. It usually affects
just one breast. You might be able to feel one or more lumps, which are often wedge-shaped.
The area might look swollen and red.

If you have an infection, you may get a fever or flu-like symptoms, such as shivers,
hot sweats, and aches.

If you get any of these symptoms you should see your midwife or doctor.
What treatments are available?
Mastitis often clears up on its own without any treatment. But doctors often recommend
women take antibiotics if their symptoms are severe or don't soon get better.

Things you can do for yourself
The best thing you can do is to carry on breastfeeding, and to always start feeding
with your affected breast first. That way, the milk that has collected and caused
the mastitis will be removed by your baby. The milk won’t harm your baby.



It's important to empty the breast completely, using a pump if necessary. This helps
to clear up the symptoms more quickly.





Draining the affected breast can also reduce your risk of getting a breast abscess.
An abscess happens when pus collects in a section of your breast and forms a lump.



If your baby refuses to feed from the affected breast, or it’s too painful for you,
try using a pump to remove the milk.





If you find breastfeeding uncomfortable, ask your midwife or health visitor for advice
on other positions you can try.

You can also take painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen. But don’t take aspirin,
as in rare cases this can cause problems for babies.



Taking hot baths and putting a hot flannel or cold compress on your breast might also
help relieve the pain. You can also try massaging your breast while you’re feeding
to help release the milk.

Some health professionals think that mastitis often happens because babies aren't
breastfeeding properly, but we don't know if this is true.

Still, you may feel reassured to know you’re breastfeeding correctly, or appreciate
advice to help you do it better. To read about good breastfeeding technique, see the
leaflet Mastitis: breastfeeding advice.

Medicines
Your doctor might prescribe antibiotics if your symptoms are severe or haven't improved
after 12 to 24 hours.

You’ll usually need to take antibiotics for between 10 and 14 days. You can continue
breastfeeding during this time.

It’s important to keep taking your antibiotics even after you start to feel better,
as there’s an increased risk of getting an abscess if you stop treatment early.

Antibiotics can cause mild side effects in some women such as diarrhoea, headaches,
and feeling sick.

They usually don't cause any problem for babies, but you should contact your doctor
if you notice that your baby has a nappy rash while you're taking an antibiotic.

What will happen to me?
Mastitis usually clears up quickly, either on its own or after a course of antibiotics.
However, up to 10 in 100 women who get mastitis get an abscess.

You’ll need to have an abscess treated quickly with antibiotics. You may also need
to have the abscess drained. Drainage usually involves a simple procedure where doctors
insert a needle into the abscess.

But a small number of women need surgery. You can usually carry on breastfeeding as
normal, whatever procedure you have."

Malaria is a dangerous disease that's spread by bites from some types of mosquito.
It's common in parts of Asia, Africa, and South America. You can't get malaria from
mosquito bites in the UK, US, or any country where malaria is not commonly found (endemic).

Taking steps to avoid mosquito bites and taking medicines can help you avoid malaria
when you visit countries where malaria is endemic.

What is malaria?
Malaria is caused by a tiny parasite. A parasite is a creature that lives inside your body. The parasites that cause malaria
are spread by mosquito bites. If you're bitten, the parasites can grow in your blood
and make you ill.

What are the symptoms?
If you get malaria you might feel as though you’ve got flu. The most common symptom
is a high temperature (fever). You might also have:



a headache


muscle aches


vomiting, or


diarrhoea.


Malaria symptoms don't always happen soon after you are infected. It can take a while
before you have any symptoms.

If you have symptoms, it's important to get treatment as soon as possible. If you aren't treated quickly you might become delirious (confused and over-excited).
Severe malaria can sometimes cause seizures (fits) or a coma.

What treatments are available?
The best way to prevent malaria is to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes. There are
some medicines that can help prevent malaria. But no treatment can protect you completely
when you're in an area where malaria is endemic.

Some treatments to prevent malaria aren't safe for pregnant women or for children.
If you're pregnant or travelling with children, talk to your doctor before travelling.

A malaria vaccine has now been developed. But it is not completely effective in stopping malaria infection.

The vaccine, when widely available, is also likely to be given as a priority to those
living in areas where malaria is endemic, rather than to travellers.

Preventing bites
There are many things you can do to prevent being bitten. For example:


sleeping inside a mosquito net that's coated with an insecticide (a chemical that kills insects) can help keep mosquitoes away and stop you getting
malaria



using netting or mesh on open windows


spraying your clothes with an insecticide called permethrin can also help. You should
spray your outer clothes, hat, and socks. The spray can have mild side effects, such
as making you itch or making your skin sore



you could try to avoid mosquitoes by not going out in the evening and at night, which
is when most bites happen



it might be better to wear light-coloured rather than dark clothing, because insects
prefer landing on dark surfaces. Full-length clothes that cover you up might help,
too.



Some doctors recommend insect repellents that you rub on your skin. A repellent containing
diethyltoluamide (DEET) is most often recommended. But it's not clear whether these repellents help prevent
malaria.

DEET can also have side effects. People who use DEET for a long time might get confused
or irritable, have difficulty sleeping, or get skin irritation.

People often burn coils containing repellent to keep mosquitoes away. You can also
buy plug-in devices to use indoors that release repellent. But it's not really clear
whether they help prevent malaria and the smoke from the coils can irritate some people's
eyes and noses.

We don't know how safe these coils are, so they're not recommended for use indoors.
You can get insecticides that you spray around your room, but doctors don’t usually
recommend them.

Medicines to prevent malaria
Different medicines are recommended for different areas of the world, and these change
over time. Some drugs need to be taken once a day and some once a week. You usually
need to start taking them before you travel, and to keep taking them for several weeks
after you get home.

It's important to check with a doctor or nurse about which drugs you need and how
to take them. The recommendations about which drugs you need for which parts of the
world change often. So you need the most up-to-date information.

These are some of the drugs most commonly used to prevent malaria.
Atovaquone and proguanil are used together as one medicine. This works well to prevent malaria in most people
in the areas for which it's recommended. But some people get mild side effects, such
as an upset stomach, backache, stomach ache, mouth ulcers, or dizziness. Some people
get a headache, strange dreams, or disturbed sleep.

Taking a combination of chloroquine and proguanil helps prevent malaria. Chloroquine tablets used to be used on their own but some
malaria parasites have grown resistant to it. It still works in some countries, so
ask a doctor or nurse which medicine you need.

Side effects of chloroquine and proguanil taken together can include nausea, diarrhoea,
and dizziness.

Doxycycline can help protect you against malaria in countries where other drugs don’t work. But
you might get side effects. These can include an upset stomach, skin problems, a cough,
or headaches.

Some women who take doxycycline get a fungal infection (candidiasis or thrush) in
their vagina. And many people who take doxycycline get a skin reaction to the sun.

Mefloquine is another drug that can prevent malaria. But it can cause serious side effects,
including strange dreams, mood changes, disturbed sleep, or difficulty concentrating.

Other common side effects include depression, dizziness, headaches, and skin problems.
You can't take it if you have epilepsy or a mental illness, such as depression or
anxiety.

What to expect in the future
If you do catch malaria you probably won’t know until after you get home. It can take
anywhere from one week to 18 months to become ill after you've been infected by a
bite. But most people get symptoms within three months.

If you get a feverish illness after visiting Asia, Africa, or South America, see a
doctor straight away.

If you catch malaria you can't infect anyone else. Malaria does not pass from person to person.

Most people recover completely with treatment. But there is a risk of dying from malaria
if you don’t get medical help. The risk is greater for older people.

But it's rare for people to die from malaria in countries where good medical treatment
is available. Malaria shouldn’t come back if it's treated properly the first time."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1559653556344/Macular%20degeneration,Macular degeneration,"Macular degeneration Last published: Jan 29, 2021
Macular degeneration is a condition that can make your eyesight worse. The type we
talk about here affects older people. It's often called age-related macular degeneration,
or AMD for short. There's no cure, but there are treatments that can help. There's
also plenty you can do to make the most of the eyesight you have.

What is macular degeneration?
The macula is part of the retina - the surface at the back of your eye that is sensitive
to light. The macula helps you see objects straight in front of you in fine detail.
Macular degeneration means that your macula is damaged. As the damage gets worse it
can affect your sight.

There are two types of macular degeneration:
With dry macular degeneration tiny yellow patches form around your macula. Your vision gets worse very slowly.
This is the most common type of macular degeneration.

With wet macular degeneration tiny blood vessels grow at the back of your eye, and over time they leak blood and
fluid. Your eyesight gets worse more quickly with this type than with the dry type.
In some people dry macular degeneration can develop into the wet kind.

What are the symptoms?
Doctors often talk about the stages of macular degeneration. These are early, intermediate,
and late or advanced macular degeneration.

People with early or intermediate macular degeneration often have no symptoms or very
mild symptoms. But people with advanced macular degeneration can have quite severe
loss of vision.

If you have symptoms you might find it harder to read, recognise people's faces, or
make out fine detail. After a few years, objects in the middle of your vision might
look blurred and distorted. Eventually this middle area of your field of vision might
turn dark, so that you may not be able to see things that are straight ahead of you.

Coping with macular degeneration
Your doctor can help you with ways to cope. He or she might suggest things such as:




Using the edge of your vision more


Trying brighter lighting in your home


Using a magnifier for reading


Using computer software that makes text bigger - or even software that reads out text
from your screen.



What treatments work?
If you have macular degeneration that is not at an advanced stage, your treatment
will be aimed at slowing the progress of the condition, and hopefully stopping it
from getting too much worse.

Treatments for early and intermediate macular degeneration
At the early and intermediate stages, wet and dry disease are treated in the same
way.

The first things your doctor will suggest are changes to your lifestyle similar to
those recommended if you have diabetes or problems with your heart or blood vessels.

This is because macular degeneration affects the blood vessels in your eyes. The aim
is to keep a healthy flow of blood to your eyes and prevent damage to the small blood
vessels in the eyes.

So your doctor will recommend that:


If you smoke you should stop


You eat a healthy diet with plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables, and not too many
starchy or processed foods



You try to be as active as possible. If you are an older person and you're not sure
what kind of exercise is advisable, talk to your doctor.



Your doctor might also recommend that you take specific vitamin and mineral supplements
that can help. But this doesn't mean that you take just any vitamin and mineral supplement:
it's important that you take the right ones. Your doctor will tell you exactly what
you need and may even prescribe them for you.

Treatments for advanced wet macular degeneration
If your symptoms are only severe in one eye your doctor might recommend that you take
special vitamin and mineral supplements, but at a higher dose than for early or intermediate
macular degeneration. The idea is to stop the condition from getting worse in your
better eye.

Your doctor might also recommend that you have a course of injections into the affected eyes. These injections are done by an eye specialist called an
ophthalmologist. The medications injected into the eyes are called vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors.

If you find the idea of injections into your eyes distressing, you are probably not
alone. But most people cope well with this treatment. If you are a little alarmed
at the prospect of having injections in your eyes, talk to your doctor, who can explain
exactly what is involved.

These injections can help slow the growth of the new blood vessels that are affecting
your vision. If you have this treatment you will probably need to have several injections
to begin with, and then one a month for a number of months.

These injections can cause side effects in some people, such as swelling or infections.
Your doctor should discuss the risks of side effects with you before you have this
treatment.

A type of laser treatment called photodynamic therapy is sometimes used to destroy leaking blood vessels in the eye. But it isn't suitable
for everyone.

Another type of laser surgery, called thermal laser photocoagulation, is sometimes used. But this is only suitable for a small number of people with severe
macular degeneration. It is also rarely used as it can cause further damage to the
eye.

Treatments for advanced dry macular degeneration
Severe dry macular degeneration is much harder to treat than the wet kind. Your doctor
will probably suggest that you see a specialist.

As with advanced wet macular degeneration, if your condition is severe in only one
eye your doctor might recommend that you take special vitamin and mineral supplements,
but at a higher dose than for early macular degeneration. The aim is to stop the condition
getting worse in your better eye.

What will happen to me?
If you have dry macular degeneration your eyesight will probably get worse over the years, especially in the middle of
your vision. But this usually happens very slowly. And it's very rare for anyone to
go totally blind.

If you have wet macular degeneration that becomes advanced it's important to get treatment, as your vision can get worse
very quickly without it. Treatment can slow down or stop the progress of the condition,
and many people's vision improves.

Doctors can't usually say how quickly your vision might get worse. Even people with
advanced macular degeneration can usually see well enough to be independent and get
around."

The lymphatic system is part of the body’s defence against infection. But if you have
lymphoedema, a build-up of fluid in the lymphatic system causes swelling, usually
in the arms or legs.

There is no cure for lymphoedema, but there are treatments that can help to control
it. You can use our information to talk with your doctor about the best treatments
for you.

What treatments are available?
The lymphatic system is spread all over your body. For example, you might have heard
of lymph nodes, which are small glands that clean lymph as it passes through them.

Lymphoedema happens when fluid can’t move easily around the lymphatic system. This
causes parts of the body, usually the arms or legs, to swell (the word oedema means swelling).

For more information about the causes and symptoms of lymphoedema, see our leaflet:
Lymphoedema: what is it?
There is no cure for lymphoedema, but treatments can help to relieve the symptoms.

Your doctor will understand that these treatments can often be time consuming, uncomfortable,
and hard to stick to. But it’s important to do the best you can, and to tell your doctor if you are having any difficulties or feeling discouraged about your treatment.

Skin care
One of the most important things that people with lymphoedema need to do is to take
care of the skin on the parts of the body where there is swelling.

It’s easy for skin on a swollen area to break, and even small cuts can lead to infection.
Skin infections such as cellulitis are a common problem for people with lymphoedema.

About one-third of people with lymphoedema have a cellulitis infection at least once
a year. Some infections are serious enough to need hospital treatment. And some people
who have a lot of problems with cellulitis take antibiotics regularly to help prevent
it.

Your doctor should advise you about good skin care. This can include things like:


regular moisturising to help prevent dry, broken skin


regular washing to help prevent the build-up of germs and funguses on the skin


wearing protective clothing while outside: for example, wearing trousers rather than
shorts or skirts, to prevent accidental scratches, and



avoiding walking barefoot.


Treatments to help reduce swelling
Static compression
An important treatment for lymphoedema is called static compression. It involves wearing special sleeves and stockings that look a bit like bandages.
You wear these under your normal clothes. These can be loosened and tightened as needed.

These garments work by gently compressing (squeezing) swollen limbs so that fluid
can’t build up and cause more swelling.

Compression garments can feel bulky and uncomfortable and it can take time to get
used to using them. But they are an important and effective part of treatment for
lymphoedema. If you have difficulty with them, talk to your doctor.

Elevation
This treatment is meant to help lymph to drain from swollen limbs and stop more fluid
from pooling there. As the name suggests, it involves raising a swollen limb above
the level of the rest of your body for a period of time.

For example, you might prop your arm up on cushions so that your hand is higher than
your wrist and your elbow is higher than your shoulder.

The results with elevation are a bit mixed. Some people find that elevation works
well, but some people find that it doesn’t help much. As with other treatments for
lymphoedema, trying them will help you to find which ones work best for you.

Exercise
People with lymphoedema are encouraged to exercise as much as possible. Exercise helps
to strengthen the muscles that help to drain lymph and reduce swelling.

You can discuss exercise with your doctor and come up with a plan that works best
for you. It’s always easier to stick to exercise if it’s something that you enjoy.

Combined massage and bandaging
You might be able to have treatment that involves massage followed by compression
bandaging. This can help to drain fluid from the lymphatic system.

As with other treatments, it works better for some people than for others. It can
also be time consuming, and it means attending regular appointments for massage. But
some people value this interaction with medical staff.

Intermittent pneumatic compression
The name makes this treatment sound complicated, but it’s really just massage done by a machine.

You wear special padded sleeves or stockings on the limbs that need massage. They
look a bit like parts of a space suit.

These sleeves and stockings are connected to a machine that controls them. When switched
on, they massage your limbs just as a person would do, helping to drain fluid from
your limbs.

Some people prefer this treatment over massage by a therapist, because it means they
can have it at home.

Psychosocial support
It’s no surprise that lymphoedema can have a negative effect on people’s quality of
life. Things like time-consuming treatments, bulky garments, problems with movement,
and your feelings about how you look can all get you down.

So it’s important to make the most of what your doctor might call psychosocial support. This sounds like a fancy term. But it just means any help that you get with your
mental and social well being.

This help can come from many places, including:


professionals, including therapists


friends


family, and


support groups. For example, in the UK, lymphoedema.org provides information and support to people with the condition and their families.



Keeping to a healthy weight
Being overweight can make lymphoedema worse. It can make treatments less helpful.
So it’s important to pay attention to your weight.

You can talk with the medical staff treating you about how to keep to a healthy weight,
and about how to lose weight if you need to.

This might involve some changes to your diet, and doing more exercise. People who are very overweight (obese) might need more treatment to lose weight.
For example, your doctor might talk with you about the possibility of weight-loss
surgery.

Antibiotics for filariasis
In some countries, mainly in South America, lymphoedema can be caused by a parasitic
infection called filariasis, which is spread by mosquitoes.

If you have filariasis, you will need special antibiotics to get rid of the infection.
But this is not common outside of South America.

Surgery
Surgery is not suitable for everyone with lymphoedema, but it can help some people.
Even if you have surgery, you will still need to keep up your compression therapy
for the rest of your life.

There are two main types of surgery for lymphoedema. These are:


procedures to remove excess tissue, such as fat that can build up around the lymphatic
system. For example, one procedure for removing excess tissue in people with lymphoedema
is liposuction. You might have heard of this procedure as a type of cosmetic surgery. It involves
using suction to remove body fat. Fat can build up more than usual in limbs affected
by lymphoedema.



surgery to create new connections in the lymphatic system that help to drain away
fluid.



All types of surgery have risks. And, while some people find that surgery helps them,
it can sometimes make things worse, or lead to other problems.

If you discuss surgery with your doctor, he or she should explain all the possible
benefits and risks.

What to expect in the future?
There is no cure for lymphoedema, but treatments can help reduce the swelling and
the chance of cellulitis. However, while your doctor will stress how important it
is to keep up with your treatments, it can sometimes be hard to stay motivated.

For example, there might be times when you feel on top of things and your symptoms
improve; but there will probably also be tough times when you find it hard to stay
positive. It can be easy to become depressed and anxious.

So it’s important to make the most of psychosocial support.

Your doctor will want to check on you at least once or twice a year, depending on
how severe your symptoms are, and on whether you have problems with cellulitis.

He or she will monitor your progress and give you help and advice on treatments, and
how to avoid complications such as infections.

Your doctor should explain to you that lymphoedema can sometimes develop into a serious
type of cancer called lymphangiosarcoma. But this is very rare. It happens to about 1 in every 200 people with lymphoedema."

For more information, see our leaflet: Lymphoedema: what treatments are available?
What is lymphoedema?
The lymphatic system is usually thought of as part of the immune system, because it
makes white blood cells, which destroy invading infections.

Glands in the lymphatic system help to prevent infections from spreading around the
body by finding and destroying germs in the lymphatic fluid.

You might know that there are lymph glands (also called lymph nodes) in the armpits,
neck, and groin. But there are hundreds of them in other places around the body.

The lymphatic system does several other jobs. For example, a clear liquid called lymph flows through the lymphatic system, helping to:



remove fluid from body tissues and return it to the bloodstream


absorb fats from your digestive system, and


remove waste products from your body fluids.


Lymphoedema happens when something stops fluid from flowing easily around the lymphatic system.
This causes parts of the body, often the arms or legs, to swell (oedema means swelling).

This swelling makes people with lymphoedema especially prone to a skin infection called
cellulitis. Cellulitis can also be a cause of lymphoedema in the first place.

Cellulitis can be treated with antibiotics, but it can sometimes be serious. Doctors give advice to people with lymphoedema
about how to protect their skin from infection, and how to get treatment quickly when
an infection happens.

There are two types of lymphoedema. These are called primary and secondary lymphoedema.

Primary lymphoedema
Primary lymphoedema is a genetic condition. That means that it is caused by the genes
you were born with. This type of lymphoedema is not caused by something external,
like an illness or an injury.

In boys, the symptoms of primary lymphoedema usually start when they are babies or very young
children. In girls, the symptoms are more likely to start in the teenage years. It’s rare for primary
lymphoedema symptoms to start when someone is an adult.

Secondary lymphoedema
This type of lymphoedema is not genetic. It can be caused by several things. The most
common causes are:



some types of cancer, which can damage the lymphatic system



having treatment for cancer. For example, lymph nodes sometimes need to be removed as part of cancer surgery
if they are close to a tumour. Surgeons take care to damage the lymphatic system as
little as possible. But if a lot of tissue has to be removed it’s not always possible
to prevent problems



skin infections, such as cellulitis, which can damage the tissue around the lymphatic system



an infection called filariasis, which is caused by tiny parasitic worms that live in the lymphatic system. This
infection is spread by mosquitoes and is not common in developed countries



physical injuries. For example, an injury that causes a lot of bruising, such as a traffic accident,
can damage some tissues of the lymphatic system.



What are the symptoms?
The main symptom lymphoedema is painless swelling, usually in the legs. The swelling can also happen in the arms and, very rarely,
in the genitals.

You might also feel heaviness and weakness in the limbs that are affected.

If your doctor thinks that you might have lymphoedema, he or she will ask you about
things that can cause it. For example, your doctor might ask about whether you have
ever:



had cancer treatment


travelled to an area where filariasis is endemic (widespread), or


had surgery.


Your doctor might also want to do some tests. These might include:



a lymphoscintigram. In this test, a tiny amount of radioactive liquid is injected under the skin. This
helps to build up an image of the lymphatic system, which can help show whether you
have lymphoedema



an ultrasound, MRI, or CT scan, which can help to show if you have a problem other than than lymphoedema, and



a blood test for filariasis, if your doctor thinks this is a possibility.



What to expect in the future?
There is no cure for lymphoedema, but there are treatments that can help reduce the
swelling and the risk of cellulitis. And, while your doctor will stress how important
it is to keep up with your treatments, it can sometimes be hard to stay motivated.

For example, there might be times when you feel on top of things and your symptoms
improve; but there will probably also be tough times when you find it hard to stay
positive.

Things such as the clothes you need to wear, the way you feel about your appearance,
infections, and problems moving your limbs can affect your quality of life and get
you down. It can be easy to become depressed and anxious.

So it’s important to make the most of what your doctor might call psychosocialsupport. This sounds like a fancy term. But it just means any help that you get with your
mental and social well being.

https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1570767362202/Lyme%20disease,Lyme disease,"Lyme disease Last published: Sep 27, 2021
Lyme disease is an infection that you can get from the bite of a tiny creature called
a tick. It can be serious, but most people recover completely with treatment.

You can use our information to talk to your doctor and decide which treatments are
best for you.

What is Lyme disease?
Lyme disease is an illness that's spread by ticks. Ticks are tiny creatures that live
on the skin of other animals and feed on their blood. But they also sometimes bite
and feed on people. They look a bit like tiny spiders.

Ticks can carry the bacteria that cause Lyme disease and, if they bite you, the bacteria
can get into your body and make you ill.

Not all ticks carry the Lyme disease bacteria (called Borrelia). And a tick usually has to stay attached to your skin for a long time (at least
one or two days) for there to be much risk of it making you ill.

If you spot a tick on your skin, you need to remove it. Grip the tick with fine-tipped
tweezers as close to your skin as you can. Pull the tick gently but firmly off your
skin, then wash the area with soap and water.

What are the symptoms?
The most common symptom of Lyme disease is a pink or red rash. It will probably appear
one to two weeks after you were bitten, spreading out from the bite. Some people get
a bull's-eye pattern, with no red in the centre.

But not everyone gets a rash. You might get flu-like symptoms, such as:


a headache


a high temperature (fever), or


muscle pains.


After a few weeks or months the infection, if untreated, can spread to your nerves
and joints. You might lose control of some of the muscles in your face. This is called
neurological Lyme disease.

If this happens you might get pain or numbness, or have difficulties moving parts
of your body.

If you're not treated you could get swollen, painful joints. This is called Lyme arthritis.

A few people with Lyme disease get meningitis. Meningitis means that the tissue covering your brain has become inflamed.

Lyme disease can also sometimes cause heart problems. These can be treated but you might need to have treatment in hospital.

Doctors often diagnose Lyme disease based on people's symptoms and on whether they
might have been exposed to ticks carrying Lyme disease. A blood test is also sometimes
used. But it isn't effective until two to six weeks after a tick bite, so it isn't
helpful for diagnosing early infections.

What treatments are available?
Preventing tick bites
If you're spending time in places where ticks are common, such as grassy or wooded
areas, you can:



wear long-sleeved tops and long trousers tucked into your socks


use an insect repellent called DEET on any exposed skin and your clothes


spray your clothes, and any tents and camping gear, with a repellent called permethrin


wear light-coloured clothing to make it easier to find and remove ticks.


If you've been in an area where there might be ticks, brush off or wash your clothes
as soon as you can. Check your body for ticks, especially in skin folds and hairy
areas.

Young ticks are about the size of a poppy seed, so they're hard to spot. Adult ticks
are bigger (about the size of a sesame seed) and might reach the size of a coffee
bean if they are full of blood. If you find a tick, carefully remove it straight away.

Treating Lyme disease
If you have Lyme disease you'll be treated with antibiotics. Antibiotics are drugs that kill bacteria. If you take them soon after getting bitten
you're very likely to make a complete recovery.

Antibiotics might also help to prevent Lyme disease. If you are in an area with Lyme
disease and you've had a tick attached to your skin for at least 36 hours, your doctor
might prescribe an antibiotic. But you would need to have treatment within three days
of removing the tick.

Antibiotics are also used to treat more serious symptoms of Lyme disease, such as
arthritis, and nerve and heart problems. You might need to be given antibiotics as
a drip (an intravenous infusion, or IV for short).

To relieve joint pain your doctor might recommend taking a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), such as diclofenac or ibuprofen.

Lyme disease in pregnancy
It is possible, but rare, for pregnant women with Lyme disease to pass it onto their
babies.

There is some evidence that untreated Lyme disease can cause problems during pregnancy,
as well as birth defects. But women who get treatment should not have problems. If
you are concerned about Lyme disease in pregnancy, talk to your doctor.

What to expect in the future?
If Lyme disease is treated early you're very likely to recover completely. If you
get a rash or flu-like illness and think you could have been bitten by a tick (even
if you didn't notice a bite), see your doctor as soon as you can.

Getting treatment early helps prevent you from getting later-stage Lyme disease, which
can be more serious. If you don't have treatment, your early symptoms (such as the
rash) might clear up. But you have a strong chance of then getting later-stage problems,
such as joint problems and nerve damage.

Some people do have lasting pain and tiredness even after they've been treated for
Lyme disease. This is sometimes called 'post-Lyme syndrome'. People with this syndrome
usually get better with time. But it can take months to feel completely better."

If you've been diagnosed with lung cancer, you may want to talk to your doctor to
find out more. Here are some questions that you might want to ask.
We have included questions to ask early on, and further questions that you might want
to ask if you have been advised to have surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy.

Questions to ask early on


What type of lung cancer do I have?


How far has it spread?


Do I need more tests? What about a CT scan? (This is a special type of x-ray that
can show where the tumour is in other parts of the body, such as the chest and brain.)




What are my treatment options?


What treatment do you recommend?


What does the treatment aim to do?


Will it help my symptoms?


Will it try to get rid of my cancer?


What side effects does the treatment have?


What will happen if I decide not to have treatment?


Are there any clinical trials that I might benefit from? (Clinical trials are studies
designed to test whether a treatment works.)



Questions to ask if you're advised to have surgery


Why are you recommending surgery?


What will you do during the operation?


Will it help my symptoms?


How will I feel after the surgery?


How long will I be in hospital, and what treatment will I need after surgery?


What could go wrong, and how likely is that?


What happens if the surgery doesn't work?


How many operations like mine have you performed?


Questions to ask if you're advised to have radiotherapy


Why are you recommending radiotherapy?


What does it aim to do?


Will it help my symptoms?


How will I feel during the treatment?


What side effects can I expect in the weeks after my treatment?


What can you do to prevent or relieve side effects?


What side effects might I get months or years after my treatment, and will any of
them be permanent?



What happens if radiotherapy doesn't work?


Questions to ask if you're advised to have chemotherapy


Why do you recommend chemotherapy?


What does it aim to do?


Will it help my symptoms?


How will I feel during and after treatment?


What are the side effects of treatment?


What can you do to prevent or relieve side effects?


What do I need to do if my white cell blood count is low? (Chemotherapy can lower
your white cell count in your blood. This makes you more prone to infections.) Should
I avoid crowded places? What should I do if a family member is ill?



Will any of the side effects be permanent?


What happens if the chemotherapy doesn't work?"

It can be devastating to find out that you or someone close to you has lung cancer.
You will have to make some important decisions about treatment. This information is
to help you understand some of the choices ahead.
You can use our information to talk to your doctor and decide which treatments are
right for you.

What happens in lung cancer?
When your body's cells are healthy they divide, grow, and are replaced in an orderly
way. But when you get cancer your cells grow too quickly and don't develop properly.
Lung cancer usually starts in your airways. Abnormal cells form a lump called a tumour,
which slowly gets bigger.

Nearly all types of lung cancer can spread to other parts of your body and form more
tumours. These are called secondary tumours or metastases. Treatments for lung cancer
are improving, but many people still die from it, especially if the cancer is at an
advanced stage.

Doctors divide lung cancer into two kinds, based on what the cancer cells look like
under a microscope.

Most people with lung cancer get a type called non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
But about 15 in 100 people who have lung cancer get small-cell lung cancer. Small-cell
lung cancer spreads more quickly. This information is about treatment for non-small-cell
lung cancer.

Smoking is the cause of most lung cancers. Other causes include exposure to other
people's tobacco smoke ('second-hand' or 'passive' smoking), working in industries
where you breathe in chemicals like asbestos, and long-term exposure to radon gas.


Stopping smoking can be hard, even when you know it is seriously affecting your health.
For information on stopping smoking, see our leaflet: Stopping smoking.

Some countries have lung cancer screening programmes for smokers. The screening uses
low-dose computerised tomography (CT) scanning to look for tumours in the lungs. If
you are concerned about lung cancer you can ask your doctor if screening is available
where you are.

What are the symptoms?
The most common symptoms of lung cancer are coughing and breathlessness. These are
common symptoms of many illnesses, but with lung cancer they don't get better over
time.

It's important to see a doctor if you have a cough or breathing problems that last
longer than a normal cold or chest infection. There are several other symptoms:



You may sometimes cough up blood.


If a tumour is blocking your airways you may be prone to chest infections, such as
bronchitis and pneumonia.



You might start to lose weight without trying.


If your lung cancer has spread you may have chest pain, hoarseness when you speak,
or difficulty swallowing.



If the cancer has spread to your bones you may have pain in your arms, legs, or back.


If you have a cough that has lasted more than a few weeks your doctor should refer
you for a chest x-ray. But your doctor might also refer you for a chest x-ray if you
have any of the other symptoms.

If the x-ray shows a tumour, you should be referred to a specialist in treating lung
cancer. If it doesn't show a tumour, you may still need to see a specialist or have
more detailed tests to rule out cancer for sure.

Doctors classify cancer by stages. A cancer stage is a number that gives an idea of
how much the cancer has spread. This number is important, because it makes a difference
to how your cancer is treated.

Stage 1: The cancer is only in the lung.
Stage 2: The cancer is small but has spread to the areas closest to the affected lung.
Stage 3: The cancer has spread to other nearby places in the chest. Stage 3 can also
mean that there is more than one tumour in the lung.

Stage 4: The cancer has spread to another lobe of the lung from where it started,
or to other parts of the body, such as the liver or brain.

What treatments work?
The main treatment for lung cancer, where possible, is surgery to remove the tumour.
You may also have radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or both, to kill any remaining cancer
cells. But not all lung cancers can be treated with surgery.

The treatment you have will depend on:


what type of lung cancer you have


what stage your cancer is at


your general levels of health and fitness.


The treatment you have should also depend on what treatment you want.
You will be treated by a team including a specialist cancer doctor, called an oncologist.
Your doctors should explain all the treatment choices to you and be sure that you
understand them.

Your doctor should also offer you the chance of a second opinion if you want one,
and should respect the decisions you make about your treatment.

Surgery
In general, surgery is the most suitable treatment if you have a small tumour that
has not spread. It's the first choice of treatment for non-small-cell lung cancer
at stage 1 or stage 2. Some stage 3 cancers are also operable.

There are various reasons why some cancers cannot be treated with surgery. For example,
if the tumour is close to your heart or to an important blood vessel or your windpipe,
your surgeon may decide that an operation is too dangerous and recommend another type
of treatment.

In the operation, the surgeon will remove part or all of the affected lung. The type
of operation you have will depend on where in the lung your tumour is and how big
it is.

Whether you can have surgery depends partly on your general health and fitness. You'll
need tests on your lungs to see how well they work. They need to work well enough
that you can breathe without the part of the lung the surgeon is going to remove.

Your doctor will also check that your heart is strong enough for the operation.
As with any kind of surgery, complications can happen with surgery for lung cancer,
so it's important to ask your doctor about the risks.

How quickly you recover will depend on your age, the type of operation you've had,
how your lungs are working, and the stage of your disease.

You may be in a lot of pain right after your operation. But good pain relief can make
you more comfortable. Don't be afraid to ask for more medication if you're still in
pain.

Try to move about as soon as possible, even if it's just walking to the end of the
room and back or stretching your legs in bed. This will help keep your blood moving
and reduce the chances of a clot forming in one of your blood vessels.

Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy means taking medicines that kill cancer cells. You might have chemotherapy
as a treatment after surgery, or if your cancer is not operable you might have it
instead of surgery. You might have chemotherapy alone, or with radiotherapy.

Chemotherapy for lung cancer is usually given through a needle into your vein. You
will need to go to a clinic to have this treatment. You might also take tablets, either
at the clinic or later at home. Each course of treatment lasts a few days.

Chemotherapy drugs can have various side effects. Your doctor will explain to you
what side effects you should expect. Some of the more common side effects include
nausea and vomiting, infections, tiredness, and diarrhoea.

You may be able to take extra drugs to help with some of these side effects: for example,
you may be able to take drugs called anti-emetics that can help reduce nausea and
vomiting. Some, but not all, chemotherapy drugs can make your hair fall out (although
it will grow back).

Radiotherapy
Radiotherapy can be used in several ways. You might have it before or after surgery,
or along with chemotherapy. You may also have radiotherapy if you are not able to
have surgery.

Radiotherapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill lung cancer cells and to shrink tumours.
The radiotherapy goes to your chest area.

When you have this treatment you lie inside the radiotherapy machine and keep very
still while you have the therapy. It only takes a few minutes each time and it does
not hurt. You will probably need to have the treatment on most days for 6 or 7 weeks.

The most common side effect after radiotherapy is irritation or swelling in your throat
or lungs. This is called oesophagitis. This can make it painful to eat or swallow
and can cause indigestion, but it can be treated with drugs that reduce the swelling.

What will happen to me?
The outlook for people with lung cancer is improving. The type of lung cancer you
have and how early it was found will affect what happens to you. The kind of treatment
you have and the way you decide to live with your cancer will also make a difference.

Predicting what will happen to people with lung cancer is hard. But, with treatment,
up to two-thirds of people with early-stage lung cancer are still alive five years
later.

Sadly, though, most people with lung cancer are diagnosed only when the disease is
advanced and it has already spread either to tissues nearby or around their body. This
makes it harder to cure.

Whatever stage your cancer is at, you will want to discuss with your oncologist what
might happen in your future.

Wherever possible, your treatment should be designed to help you get what you want
out of life. You may wish to spend time with friends or family, or you may want to
stay as active or independent as possible.

Your doctors should respect your priorities and help you choose the treatments that
you feel are right for you."

​When you have a lumbar puncture (or 'spinal tap') a doctor uses a needle to take
some fluid from around your spine for testing.

Here, we look at how the test is done, how it may help you, and what to expect afterwards.
You can use our information to discuss the test with your doctor.

What is a lumbar puncture?
Medical tests can help to diagnose various problems. For example, most people have
had scans, such as x-rays, or given blood or urine samples.

With a lumbar puncture, a doctor takes a sample of the fluid that surrounds your spine,
called cerebrospinal fluid. This fluid does several jobs in the body, including:



Helping to protect the bones and nerves in your spine from injury - for example if
you have a fall, and



Helping to remove waste products from your brain.


Doctors use this test to check for signs of some medical conditions, such as those
that affect your nervous system, and for certain infections.

A lumbar puncture is more complex than many routine medical tests, so it’s useful
to know about what’s happening and how it may affect you.

When you have a lumbar puncture:



You undress and lie on a trolley on your left side with your knees drawn up. Your
doctor may ask you to sit on the edge of the trolley instead, depending on what the
test is for



The doctor needs to take fluid from between two of the bones (called vertebrae) in your lower back. They will find the spot they want and clean it carefully to
prevent infection



The doctor will give you two injections of local anaesthetic: one near the surface of your skin and the other into the deeper tissue. These injections
should prevent you from feeling any pain during the procedure



After waiting a few minutes for the anaesthetic to work, the doctor will insert the
needle and begin to draw out some cerebrospinal fluid for testing



Collecting the fluid takes between 30 and 45 minutes


Once the fluid is collected, the doctor removes the needle and puts a dressing over
the area



The test is now finished. But you will need to lie down for about an hour afterwards.


Why might I need a lumbar puncture?
Testing cerebrospinal fluid can help doctors to spot problems including:


Some types of infection, including meningitis


Encephalitis (swelling in the brain)


Bleeding in the brain


Some conditions that can lead to tumours, and


Multiple sclerosis and other conditions that affect the nervous system.



Not everyone can have a lumbar puncture. For example, you won’t be able to have this
test if you:



Are allergic to the anaesthetic


Have an injury to your lower back, or


Have been diagnosed with swelling in the brain.


What are the risks?
Lumbar puncture is a fairly common test, but it is done in a sensitive part of the
body that has a lot of nerves and blood vessels. So problems can sometimes happen.

The most common problem is a headache after having the test. About one third of people who have a lumbar puncture have
a headache afterwards. This doesn’t usually last for more than a few days, but it
can last for up to two weeks.

Other possible problems include:


Bleeding around the spine. This is rare. But if it happens you may need treatment
to stop it



Infection


Pain in the nerves of the lower back, and


Having to repeat the test if the fluid doesn’t flow properly.


What can I expect afterwards?
Your doctor will want to keep an eye on you for at least an hour after you have the
test, to check for any problems.

You should be able to go home the same day, but you won’t be able to drive home.
Your doctor will advise you to take things easy for a few days, and to stay hydrated
by drinking plenty of (non-alcoholic) fluids.

If you have a headache, take painkillers, such as paracetamol, if you need to. But
don’t take more than the recommended dose.

Your doctor may also suggest that you drink fluids that contain caffeine, which is
a natural painkiller. But make sure to drink them in moderation, especially if you’re
not used to caffeine.

Be aware of how you’re feeling, and call your doctor or get medical help if you:


Have a lot of bleeding where the needle went in


Have swelling where the needle went in that gets worse or doesn’t go down after a
few days



Develop a fever


Have a severe headache, or a headache that won’t go away


Feel nauseous or vomit, or


Find it painful to look at bright lights.

There’s no miracle cure that will make fibromyalgia go away. But you can learn to
manage your condition, so that it doesn’t take over your life.

We have provided some advice from doctors on how to manage fibromyalgia below.


Learn as much as you can about fibromyalgia. It’s a long-term condition, so you are
likely to have to live with it for some time. Finding out about how best to manage
it can help you get on with life. Ask your doctor if there’s a local fibromyalgia
education group you can join.



Take some exercise most days, even if it’s not very much. You can start with a small
amount and gradually build up. Keeping active can help you feel better overall. And
keeping to a regular routine may help you feel that you’ve achieved something every
day.



Establish a regular sleep routine. Good-quality sleep is very important, but many
people with fibromyalgia have trouble sleeping. Discuss with your doctor how to improve
your sleep.



Have a support network of friends or family. It’s easy to get isolated when you’re
not well. But keeping in touch with people can help improve your mood. Some people
find fibromyalgia support groups helpful.



There have been studies into fibromyalgia treatments, but researchers haven't yet
found a treatment that works to relieve pain for everyone. Work with your doctor to
try different treatments and find out what helps you. Chances are your symptoms will
get better over time."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1438333992761/Living%20with%20Crohn%27s%20disease,Living with Crohn's disease,"Living with Crohn's disease Last published: Aug 05, 2021
Crohn's disease can be a frustrating illness. Some of the time you may feel fine,
and other times you may feel as though you can't do much at all.

Over time you'll probably get better at listening to your body and working out what
you can and can't do on a particular day.

We've talked to doctors and to people who have Crohn's. Here, we look at some of the
ideas they had about living with the condition.



It's worth taking some time to find out about Crohn's disease. Research suggests that people who got more information tended to feel less anxious.
Knowing more about Crohn's can help you recognise the times when you need to see a
doctor.

Being aware of the different medications that may help is also useful. For example,
you can ask your doctor about switching medicines if you're getting side effects from your treatment.



Talking to your doctor is a good first step for learning more about Crohn's. The internet
is another useful source of information, although it's worth looking at who wrote
the information on a particular website, to make sure it's reliable.

Other people with Crohn's can help by offering information and support. You may want
to find a support group in your area, or look for forums or chat rooms online.



Some people with Crohn's find that the food they eat doesn't affect their symptoms
much. For others, particular foods can cause problems. For example, if you have a
narrow section in your bowel, foods that have lots of fibre may lead to a blockage,
while some people with Crohn's need more fibre.

You can ask your doctor to refer you to a dietitian. A dietitian can help you adjust your diet while still getting all the nutrients
you need to stay healthy.



If you smoke, this can be especially harmful if you have Crohn's disease, as it can mean that
you get symptoms more often. Also, surgery for Crohn's is less successful in people
who smoke. If you want to stop smoking, there are treatments that can help. Talk to
your doctor or pharmacist.



It's important to pay attention to how you're feeling. Crohn's disease doesn't happen
because of stress, but people who are especially depressed or anxious seem to get
worse symptoms. And if you're feeling stressed, this may make it harder to cope with
your illness.

Your doctor can provide advice and recommend treatments if you’re feeling stressed, anxious, or depressed.



Talk to your doctor about day-to-day medicines for treating symptoms like stomach
pain or cramps. For example, antispasmodic drugs can help with cramps. If you get
pain, many doctors recommend paracetamol.

You can get stronger painkillers on prescription. But you should avoid painkillers
called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) - ibuprofen is one of the most
common. These drugs can irritate your stomach, which may make the symptoms of Crohn's
worse."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/3000157/Leukaemia%20%28chronic%20lymphocytic%29,Leukaemia (chronic lymphocytic),"Leukaemia (chronic lymphocytic) Last published: Feb 01, 2022
Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia is a type of cancer that affects the blood cells. It
usually only affects older people. It is not totally curable but there are treatments
that can often stop the symptoms for several years.

You can use our information to talk to your doctor about the best treatment for you.
What is chronic lymphocytic leukaemia?
Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is a type of cancer that starts in the bone marrow.
It usually only affects middle-aged and older people and is very rare in people under
40.

Leukaemia is often called 'cancer of the blood' because it affects blood cells. Blood
cells are made in bone marrow in the middle of our long bones (like the thigh bone),
and we have three types:



red cells carry oxygen around the body


white cells help fight infection


platelets help with blood clotting when we have a wound.


If you have CLL, the white blood cells grow out of control so that there are too many.
But they are weak and don't work properly, so that they can't fight infection as well
as they should. This makes you more likely to get serious infections.

CLL tends to grow and spread very slowly. Doctors call this type of slow-growing cancer
an 'indolent' cancer. It can sometimes spread so slowly that it doesn't actually cause
you any problems during your lifetime.

We're not completely sure what causes CLL, but it's probably genetic.
What are the symptoms?
Once CLL starts to spread and cause symptoms, these can include:


swollen lymph glands. You might notice this swelling in the neck, armpits, and groin


weight loss


night sweats


fever


chills, and


fatigue (tiredness).


But many people find out that they have CLL many years before it starts to cause them
any problems. This happens when they have a blood test called an FBC (full blood count)
for a reason that has nothing to do with CLL.

If you have a blood test that shows that you have CLL, you will have more blood tests
to see how far the cancer has progressed. If it has not started to spread, you probably
won't need any treatment for now.

Your doctor might also suggest that you have a test called a bone marrow biopsy. This
involves using a needle to take a small sample of the soft tissue from inside one
of your bones - often the pelvis (hip bone).

A bone marrow biopsy is not needed to diagnose CLL. But it can help to show what kind
of treatment you need.

What treatments work?
Many people find out that they have CLL long before they will need any treatment.
This is because you can have CLL for years before it starts to cause any problems.

There is no benefit in starting treatment before CLL reaches the point where it is
causing problems. So, unlike with many medical problems, early treatment won't help.

But you will need to have treatment straight away if tests show that you have begun
to have problems including:



a shortage of red blood cells (anaemia)


a shortage of platelets (thrombocytopenia)


physical symptoms such as painful swollen glands, fever, and weight loss


white blood cells multiplying very rapidly, and


swollen lymph glands on your liver or spleen.


Your doctor might talk to you about what stage your cancer has reached. Staging is a way of describing how much the cancer has affected
your blood cells, and the types of problems it is causing. It also helps guide what
treatment you might need.

Chemotherapy
Treatment for CLL is chemotherapy. Chemotherapy drugs are medicines that kill cancer cells. The usual treatment is
to use several chemotherapy drugs together, for treatment cycles lasting several weeks.

Depending on what drugs you need, you might be able to take some of them as tablets
at home, while others might need to be given as IV infusions in hospital.

Your doctor will explain exactly how your treatment will work, and you should ask
any questions that you want to, at any time.

The drugs you need might depend on what stage your cancer has reached.
CLL is not curable, even with chemotherapy. But the treatment can lead to what's called
remission, which is when the cancer is no longer active and you don't have symptoms.

But most people will have symptoms again and need more chemotherapy within a few years.
Chemotherapy for CLL can cause unpleasant side effects, including:


extreme tiredness


nausea


anaemia, which can lead to a feeling of weakness and shortness of breath


hair loss, and


a weakened immune system, which can make you more likely to get infections.


Most of these side effects stop when you have stopped having chemotherapy.
If your first course of chemotherapy doesn't work, or if it works but your symptoms
come back quickly, your doctor will recommend trying different chemotherapy drugs
for your next round of treatment.

Stem cell transplant
Some people might be able to have a treatment called a stem cell transplant. This
involves taking healthy bone marrow cells from a donor and putting them into your
bone marrow.

But this treatment is complex and is not commonly available. It is also more likely
to work in people who are younger and in fairly good general health. So some people
might not be strong enough to have this treatment.

What will happen?
Between 25 and 50 in 100 people will be free of symptoms (in remission) after their
first course of chemotherapy.

But this isn't a cure, and even if you are in remission your symptoms will usually
return after a few years. You will then need more chemotherapy to stop them again.

Some people choose not to have any more treatment because they find the side effects
of chemotherapy so unpleasant. This is your decision to make, and no one can make
you have any treatment that you don't want.

If you decide to stop treatment, your healthcare team will talk to you about what's
called palliative care. It means making you as comfortable as possible when you have
a condition that can't be cured.

It's not possible to say what will happen to an individual, but most people with CLL
are still alive more than five years after being diagnosed. And many people live fairly
healthy and normal lives for some years after treatment for CLL.

But having CLL can cause serious complications, including:


a weakened immune system. Both the condition and chemotherapy can affect your immune
system so that you're more likely to get infections



a greater chance of other cancers. For example, people with CLL are more likely to
get skin, stomach, bowel, and lung cancers, as well as a type of lymphatic cancer
called non-Hodgkin's lymphoma



anaemia.


CLL is not uncommon, and there is a lot of help available. There are many charities
and support groups for people with CLL and their families and carers. For example,
in the UK, the CLL Support Association (cllsupport.org.uk) offers information, advice,
and support.

Your doctor might be able to put you in touch with a group in your area, or you could
search online."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/3000060/Leukaemia%20%28acute%20lymphocytic%29,Leukaemia (acute lymphocytic),"Leukaemia (acute lymphocytic) Last published: Aug 30, 2022
Acute lymphocytic leukaemia is a type of cancer that affects the blood. It is rare,
but it is the most common type of leukaemia in children. Most children recover with
treatment, but the outlook is less good for adults.
What is acute lymphocytic leukaemia?
Acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL) is a type of cancer that starts in the bone marrow.
It is very rare in adults. About three quarters of people who get ALL are children
under five years old.

Leukaemia is often called ‘cancer of the blood’ because it affects blood cells. Blood
cells are made in bone marrow in the middle of our long bones, and we have three types:



red cells carry oxygen around the body


white cells help fight infection


platelets help with blood clotting when we have a wound.


If you have ALL, the white blood cells don’t work properly and can’t fight infection
as well as they should. This makes you more likely to get serious infections.

With ALL, the white cells also grow out of control so that there are too many of them
and not enough red cells and platelets. This means that not enough oxygen gets around
your body to your organs.

The cause of ALL is not always clear. But possible causes include:


the genes you inherit from your parents


smoking


a viral infection, and


exposure to radiation.


What are the symptoms?
The symptoms of ALL usually appear over several weeks. They can include:


fatigue (tiredness)


shortness of breath


bleeding and easy bruising


recurrent infections, which may cause fever


changes in skin colour


a red or purple rash


abdominal (tummy) pain


painful bones


enlarged lymph nodes. The lymph nodes are glands in various parts of the body. Swollen
lymph nodes are often most obvious in the armpits, groin, neck, and under the chin.




ALL usually occurs in very young children, who may either be too young to talk at
all, or to describe their symptoms clearly. So if you notice these symptoms in your
child, get medical help straight away.

ALL is very rare, so a child with a few of these symptoms is unlikely to have it.
But any child with these symptoms still needs to see a doctor.

If your doctor thinks that your child (or you) has ALL, he or she will want to do
some tests. These might include:



blood tests


bone marrow tests. This involves taking a small part of the soft bone marrow using
a needle. This is done under local anaesthetic to reduce pain.



scans, such as a chest x-ray.


These tests can tell whether someone definitely has ALL. They can also detect complications,
such as fluid building up around the lungs, that might need treatment.

What treatments are available?
Chemotherapy
The main treatment for ALL is chemotherapy. Chemotherapy drugs are medicines that
kill cancer cells.

There are three stages of chemotherapy treatment for ALL:


Induction. This first stage of treatment aims to kill all the cancer cells in the bone marrow.




Consolidation is the second stage of treatment. The aim is to kill any cancer cells that have survived
the first round of treatment or that are hard to detect on tests.



Maintenance is the third stage. It is longer-term treatment that helps stop the leukaemia from
returning.



The three stages might involve different treatments. For example, induction treatment
is given in hospital or in a specialist cancer centre, while some treatments in the
consolidation and maintenance stages can be taken as outpatients, especially for older
children and adults.

Many of the medicines in this first stage will probably be given as injections and
possibly as intravenous (IV) drips, while older children and adults may also be able
to take some of these stage-two and stage-three treatments as tablets.

Unfortunately, chemotherapy causes some side effects in almost everyone. But not everyone
gets the same ones, and some people are less badly affected than others. Possible
side effects of chemotherapy can include:



nausea and vomiting


changes in bowel habits, such as diarrhoea or constipation


loss of appetite


mouth ulcers


fatigue (tiredness)


skin rashes


hair loss


infertility


bruising and bleeding.


Nearly all these side effects are temporary and end when the treatment ends. But infertility
caused by chemotherapy is often permanent. Adults with ALL can talk with their doctor
about possible treatment options if you are concerned about the effect on fertility.


Other treatments alongside chemotherapy
While having chemotherapy, people with ALL might need other treatments, including:


intravenous (IV) fluids, to prevent dehydration


platelet and red blood cell transfusions, to help maintain the balance of the different
types of cells in your blood



medicines to help prevent infections. These might include antibiotics to kill bacteria,
antifungals for fungal infections, and antivirals to fight viruses.




Stem cell transplantation
Some people might also need stem cell transplantation. This involves taking cells
from the bone marrow of a donor. These cells should help to grow new, healthy white
blood cells.

Stem cell transplantation is usually used when there is thought to be a strong chance
of the cancer returning after chemotherapy.

Stem cell donors are usually relatives, preferably siblings (brothers or sisters),
because their cells will be a good match. But they can just be people whose bone marrow
matches that of the person with ALL.

Immunotherapy
Unfortunately, chemotherapy doesn’t always work. When this happens, one possible option
is a treatment called immunotherapy. Immunotherapy drugs help the body’s immune system
to fight cancer.

Immunotherapy isn’t suitable for everyone. But you can discuss with your doctor what
the best options are for you or your child.

What to expect in the future
Treatment for most types of cancer is improving all the time. But ALL is a serious
illness, and the treatment doesn’t always work.

Survival rates for ALL depend very much on age. Younger people have the best chance
of remission and recovery. Remission means that the cancer is gone after treatment,
but that it could still come back. ALL that comes back after remission is hard to
treat.



More than half of people aged under 55 years will be alive 5 years having treatment.


About 30 in 100 people aged between 55 and 64 will be alive 5 years later.


Less than 20 in 100 people aged 5 and over will be alive 5 years later.


Remember, these numbers don't mean that people are only expected to live for 5 years
after treatment. They just mean that studies longer than 5 years are difficult to
do, because it's hard to keep track of people for longer than that.

You might find it useful to contact an organisation that helps people with leukaemia
and their families. For example, in the UK, leukaemiacare.org.uk provides support
and information."

Leg ulcers can be painful and sometimes take a long time to heal. But with treatment
almost all ulcers get better eventually.

You can use our information to talk to your doctor and decide which treatments are
right for you.

What are leg ulcers?
A leg ulcer is a sore with broken skin on your lower leg that won't heal. Leg ulcers
sometimes start after a knock or bump breaks the skin on your lower leg. A wound can
turn into a leg ulcer if it doesn't heal.

You are more likely to get leg ulcers if you have a condition called chronic venous insufficiency. This means that there are problems with the veins in your lower legs. The ulcers
that can be caused by this condition are called venous leg ulcers.

You are more likely to have this condition if you have ever had deep vein thrombosis (a blood clot in a vein in your leg).

This information is for people who have venous leg ulcers. It doesn't cover people
with diabetes who get diabetic foot ulcers.

What are the symptoms?
Leg ulcers are shallow, moist wounds where the skin is broken. They're often red or
yellowish. They can be any size and some even stretch all the way around the leg.
They get smaller as they heal.

If you get rough, bumpy tissue in your ulcer it's usually good news. It shows your
ulcer is healing.

What treatments work?
As well as treatments to help to heal ulcers there are treatments that can help prevent
them if your doctor thinks you are at high risk of getting them. There are also things
you can do yourself to help prevent them.

Things you can do yourself
If you have chronic venous insufficiency too much blood can sometimes pool in your
lower legs when you're not moving. This can cause swelling and make ulcers more likely.

To make this less likely, doctors often recommend that you put your feet up whenever you sit down. It's also a good idea to raise the foot of your bed slightly.


Exercising regularly and eating a balanced diet can also help keep your circulation working as well as possible.

Smoking can affect your body's ability to heal and can cause problems with your blood vessels.
So if you smoke it's best to stop.

If you are overweight, losing weight can reduce your chance of getting leg ulcers. If you'd like help with
stopping smoking or losing weight your doctor can help.

Try to avoid bumping or scratching your legs. Breaking the skin can make an ulcer
more likely.

Treatments to prevent leg ulcers
If you've had an ulcer, wearing compression stockings can help to stop you getting another. These are special medical stockings that come
up to the knee. They compress your lower legs so that it's harder for the blood to
pool and for swelling to happen.

It's very important that you follow your doctor or nurse's instructions on how and
when to wear them. For them to work properly you'll need to wear them all the time
apart from when you're in bed.

The most common reason for ulcers not getting better is people not wearing the compression
stockings enough.

Simple moisturising creams can help prevent skin from breaking, by keeping the skin
moist and stopping it from drying out. You apply this to the unbroken skin, not onto
a wound itself. You should talk to your doctor first about what to use and how to
use it.

Treatments to help leg ulcers heal
Doctors usually recommend that leg ulcers are tightly bandaged and that these bandages
are changed regularly.

A drug called pentoxifylline can help your ulcer to heal. It works by helping keep the veins in your legs open
wide enough that blood can flow through them properly.

This is the first drug treatment that most people with venous leg ulcers are offered.
You'll need to keep wearing the bandages, too.

You take pentoxifylline as tablets. Although it can help with healing it can cause
side effects in some people, including, nausea, diarrhoea, and indigestion.

Drugs called  micronised purified flavonoid fractions (MPFFs) can help leg ulcers to heal. They tend to be used in people who have large ulcers
that don't heal with other treatments. These drugs are not available in some countries,
including the UK.

It's important to keep your ulcer clean. Warm tap water is usually enough to remove
any pus or dead tissue. But sometimes doctors and nurses use other treatments. They
might gently scrape away the dead tissue with a scalpel or use a chemical to wash
it away.

As well as compression treatment your doctor might suggest treatments for the veins
in your leg to help heal your ulcer. These might include:



surgically removing veins that are causing you problems


laser treatment to seal the veins (called endovenous laser treatment)


injecting special foam into the veins (foam sclerotherapy).



What will happen to me?
Your ulcer will almost certainly heal eventually if you follow your doctor's treatment
advice. If treatment goes well your ulcer should heal in less than three months. But
it sometimes takes much longer. Some ulcers need up to a year to heal.

Some people worry that, like the foot problems sometimes caused by diabetes, leg ulcers
can lead to having part of their leg amputated. This is not true. Leg ulcers caused
by chronic venous insufficiency do not lead to amputations."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1454942817891/Leg%20cramps%3A%20what%20treatments%20work%3F,Leg cramps: what treatments work?,"Leg cramps: what treatments work? Last published: Jan 07, 2021
Leg cramps are painful muscle contractions (spasms). They're not usually serious and
you might not need treatment. But if your leg cramps are troublesome or if they stop
you sleeping, there are treatments that you can try.

We've brought together the best research about leg cramps and weighed up the evidence
about how to treat and prevent them. You can use our information to talk to your doctor
and decide which treatments are best for you.

Short-term treatment
The simplest way to relieve cramps in the short term is to gently stretch the muscles
that are affected. Rubbing the muscles can also help. If you’re able to, you could
try putting all your weight on the painful leg for a few minutes.

Painkillers, yes or no?
Although taking painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen might seem like a good
way to treat painful leg cramps, these medicines might not do you any good. This is
because the spasm that causes the pain is likely to be over by the time the painkiller
starts working.

Preventing leg cramps
You may be able to take steps to prevent cramps that keep coming back. However, what
steps you take will depend on what is causing your cramps. It might mainly involve
treating the condition that is causing the cramps.

Leg cramps from an unknown cause
There isn’t much good research on how to prevent the return of cramps with an unknown
cause.

Many treatments have been used to try to prevent this type of cramp. Research suggests
that the most effective might be:



a drug called naftidrofuryl that’s sometimes used to treat a condition called peripheral
arterial disease



vitamin B complex supplements


a drug called diltiazem that is often used to treat high blood pressure and a type
of heart pain called angina.



You can discuss with your doctor whether any of these treatments might be the right
one for you.

Leg cramps caused by exercise
Drinking plenty of fluids before exercising may help prevent leg cramps.
If you still get leg cramps after exercising:


rest in a room that’s at a comfortable temperature and not stuffy


gently stretch the affected muscles


if your urine is dark, drink a sports drink and eat a salty snack.


If, after exercising, you have very severe cramps, feel very faint and dizzy, and
feel either very hot or very cold, you should get medical attention right away.

Leg cramps linked to diabetes
If you have diabetes, you may get leg cramps during a hypoglycaemic episode (or 'hypo'),
where your blood sugar gets too low. The simplest way to treat the cramps is to treat
the hypo, by having a sugary drink or snack.

Good blood sugar control may help prevent more hypos and leg cramps. This could mean
adjusting your diet, avoiding alcohol, and talking with your doctor to make sure you
are taking the right medicines for you.

Leg cramps during pregnancy
Changes in the body during pregnancy can cause leg cramps. These usually stop after
the birth.

Some doctors recommend magnesium salts supplements for preventing leg cramps in pregnancy.
But high doses can cause diarrhoea. Vitamin B supplements may also help. However,
you shouldn’t take any medicines, vitamins, or supplements while you're pregnant unless
they are recommended by your doctor.

Leg cramps linked to dialysis
Some people get leg cramps when they have a treatment called dialysis. This treatment
uses a machine to clean your blood if your kidneys don’t work properly.

There are treatments that can help prevent cramps caused by dialysis. For example,
a combination of vitamin E and vitamin C supplements may help some people.

Another treatment that may help is a medicine called quinine. But this drug can have
serious side effects, including nausea, headaches, dizziness, diarrhoea, liver damage,
and sometimes blindness. Because of this, in some countries, including the US, it
is not used for leg cramps, or is used only as a last resort.

Leg cramps caused by cirrhosis
Cirrhosis is a type of liver damage that’s usually caused by drinking too much alcohol
over many years. It can cause leg cramps in some people. Zinc sulphate or vitamin
E supplements are sometimes recommended for prevention.

Leg cramps caused by conditions that affect the muscles or nerves
Conditions such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and motor neuron disease can cause leg
cramps.

There are many medicines and supplements you can try for preventing cramps if you
have one of these conditions, but research has not given a clear picture about what
works best. Possible treatments include muscle relaxers, drugs that are usually used
for epilepsy, or antidepressants. You can talk with your doctor about what might work
best for you."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1454942614372/Leg%20cramps%3A%20what%20are%20they%3F,Leg cramps: what are they?,"Leg cramps: what are they? Last published: Jan 07, 2021
Leg cramps are not usually serious and you might not need treatment. But if your leg
cramps are troublesome and stop you sleeping, there are treatments that you can try.

What are leg cramps?
People who get a leg cramp feel a sudden pain in one or both legs, often at night.


This happens when a muscle or group of muscles suddenly tightens (contracts). This
is called a muscle spasm. Most cramps happen in calf muscles, but you can also get
cramps in your thigh or in your foot.

Leg cramps usually happen at night or when you are resting. The muscle contractions
can last for a few seconds or up to 10 minutes.

What else can cause leg pain?
Cramps aren't the only cause of leg pain. You can also get severe calf pain after
an injury, or if you have a Baker's cyst that bursts (a Baker's cyst is a lump of
fluid that forms behind the knee).

If you have leg pain that is severe, lasts more than 10 minutes, and is accompanied
by redness, swelling, and fever, you should seek medical help immediately. It could
be a sign of something more serious.

Why do I get leg cramps?
We don't know very much about what causes leg cramps or why certain people get them.
Most people who have these pains in their legs are not ill. But some things can make
you more likely to get painful cramps, including:



being pregnant


being aged 60 or older


doing vigorous exercise


having dialysis (this is when a machine is used to clean your blood because your kidneys
aren't working properly)



having an imbalance of some salts and minerals in your body (this is called an electrolyte
imbalance)



having problems with your blood circulation or having varicose veins in your legs
(varicose veins happen when valves in veins don't work properly, so that blood pools
in the veins)



having damaged nerves or a disease that affects your nerves, such as motor neuron
disease



having a disease that affects your muscles, such as multiple sclerosis


having diabetes (leg cramps can happen if your blood sugar gets too low, which is
called a hypoglycaemic episode, or 'hypo').



Some medicines can cause leg cramps as a side effect. They include:


diuretics


nifedipine


beta-agonists


corticosteroids (often just called steroids)


morphine


cimetidine


penicillamine


statins


lithium.


What are the symptoms of leg cramps?
Leg cramps often happen at night. You'll probably feel a sharp pain that might wake
you from your sleep. This happens most often in the calf muscle.

Here are some of the signs of a leg cramp:


The main symptom is pain that comes on suddenly


You will probably feel your calf muscle hardening


The pain from the muscle tightening (contracting) can last for just a few seconds
or up to 10 minutes



Your muscle might be sore for up to 24 hours afterwards


Only one leg is usually affected.


What will happen to me?
Leg cramps can be annoying or can disturb your sleep. But they aren't likely to cause
any serious problems. They usually go away quite suddenly on their own.

You can be in a lot of pain and keep waking up at night because of sudden muscle spasms
in a part of your leg, probably your calf. And you might get cramps for several weeks.
But most people find their leg cramps suddenly go away.

If you get leg cramps while you're pregnant you'll probably find that they are more
troublesome later in pregnancy, especially at night. But you'll probably stop having
leg cramps as soon as you've had your baby."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/3000183/Laryngeal%20mask%20airway,Laryngeal mask airway,"Laryngeal mask airway Last published: Apr 06, 2020
This procedure is usually used to help people breathe steadily during surgery, while
they are under anaesthetic. But it can be used in other situations where someone is
having trouble breathing. This leaflet explains how the procedure works.

What is a laryngeal mask airway?
The larynx is the medical term for the top of your windpipe, or airway. It’s a tube of muscle
in your throat and upper chest that connects your mouth to your lungs.

A laryngeal mask airway is a tube that passes over the tongue and along the larynx,
to deliver oxygen to your lungs.

On the end of the tube that goes into your mouth is an inflatable rubber cuff. When
this is inflated inside your larynx, it blocks your oesophagus (food pipe), so that
the oxygen only goes into your lungs, where it’s needed.

The oxygen comes through another tube at the other end of the device.
The tube that’s put in your larynx is held in place by a mask that rests on your face.
This mask also stops oxygen leaking before it can reach your lungs.

Why might I need a laryngeal mask airway?
The main reason that many people need this procedure is to help them breathe steadily
while under anaesthetic, during surgery.

As well as oxygen, this procedure can also be used to pump anaesthetic gas into the
lungs during surgery, so that you stay asleep.

You might also need this procedure if you stop breathing for any reason, often while
unconscious. It’s one of several methods that can be used to help someone whose breathing
has stopped or is weak.

What will happen?
This procedure will almost always happen when someone is unconscious, either because
he or she is about to have surgery, or because of a medical emergency.

The medic performing the procedure will position your head and chin so that your airway
should be open. He or she will then:



pass the tube with the inflatable cuff at the end into your mouth, over your tongue,
and down into your larynx (airway) until it is in position





gently secure the mask over your mouth




inflate the cuff to block off your oesophagus, to make sure that oxygen (or anaesthetic)
goes into your lungs and not your stomach





attach the mask to the tube that is supplying oxygen or anaesthetic




check that your lungs are rising and falling steadily, and together.


What are the risks?
If you have this procedure, the medic treating you will keep a close eye on how it
is working. In particular, he or she will check that your chest is rising and falling.
This shows that your airway is open and the oxygen is reaching your lungs and not
your stomach.

If the oxygen flows into your stomach this can cause problems. For example, it can
cause vomiting. If this happens, there is a chance that you could breathe vomit into
your lungs, and that this could then block your airway.

Medics also need to take special care when treating someone who might have a spine
injury. This usually involves trying to open the airway without moving the head, so
that they don’t disturb the spine.

What can I expect afterwards?
This procedure continues until you don’t need it any more.
But, whether you have this procedure during surgery, or because of a medical emergency,
the medics treating you will keep a close eye on you for some time after you are able
to breathe by yourself.

Your doctor might also want to do a blood test when you are able to breathe on your
own, to make sure that enough oxygen is getting into your blood."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/3000152/Large%20bowel%20obstruction,Large bowel obstruction,"Large bowel obstruction Last published: Jun 02, 2020
A large bowel obstruction means that something is blocking your large bowel (lower
intestine). It is a medical emergency that usually needs surgery.

Several things can cause a large bowel obstruction, but the most common cause is bowel
cancer. Most people with bowel cancer usually have surgery to remove the part of the
bowel that is affected by cancer.

What is a large bowel obstruction?
The large bowel is the lower part of the digestive system. You might also hear it
called the large intestine, lower intestine, or colon. Water and vitamins are absorbed
into your body from here, and waste material (faeces or “poo”) is pushed down towards
the rectum.

When something blocks the large bowel it’s called a large bowel obstruction. This
is a medical emergency, as the obstruction can cause serious problems.

For example, you can become quickly dehydrated because you are not absorbing water,
and the bowel can become damaged (perforated), which can lead to an infection and
damage to nearby blood vessels.

If you have a large bowel obstruction you will almost certainly need surgery.
The most common cause of large bowel obstruction is bowel cancer. This happens when
a tumour grows in the bowel. Large bowel obstructions are more common in older people
and in women.

As well as surgery to remove any part of the bowel that is affected by a tumour, treatments
for bowel cancer include chemotherapy (drug treatments) and radiotherapy.

For more information on bowel cancer and its treatments, see our leaflets: Bowel cancer: what is it?; Bowel cancer: what treatments work?; and Bowel cancer: should I be screened?

Bowel cancer causes about 90 in 100 bowel obstructions. But several other things can
cause them, including:



twisting of the bowel. The medical name for this twisting is “volvulus”




narrowing of a section of the bowel. The medical name is “stricture”. This can be
caused be several things, including problems with blood vessels, and a bowel condition
called diverticulitis





hernia




an object that has been swallowed, or an object inserted into the rectum




some cancers that only affect women, such as cervical cancer


a condition that affects women called endometriosis. If you have endometriosis, tissue
that should only grow inside the uterus (womb) grows on other parts of the body, including
the bowel.



What are the symptoms?
Symptoms of a large bowel obstruction can include:


pain in the abdomen (tummy)




a hard, swollen abdomen




changes in your bowel habits: for example, you might need to go to the toilet more
than usual, or you might not be able to go at all





stools (faeces) can become either harder or softer than usual




unexplained weight loss




inability to pass wind




nausea and vomiting




bleeding from your rectum




fever. This is a sign of infection. It could mean that the bowel has become damaged,
or is about to be damaged, and that the contents are leaking into the abdomen. This
damage is called a perforation.



These symptoms can vary depending on the cause of the obstruction. The cause can also
affect whether the symptoms come on suddenly or more gradually over time.

When bowel cancer is the cause, the symptoms come on gradually. Symptoms will probably include recent
weight loss and bleeding from the rectum. This type of obstruction is more common
in older people.

When twisting (volvulus) is the cause, the symptoms come on quickly. This type of obstruction is more common
in people:



with a history of serious bowel problems




who have had abdominal surgery in the past




with diabetes, and




who use laxatives for a long-term bowel condition.


When diverticular disease is the cause, the symptoms come on gradually, and will probably include pain and
tenderness in the abdomen. (For more information, see our leaflet: Diverticular disease.)

When narrowing of the bowel (stricture) is the cause, the symptoms will probably include having to go to the toilet a lot,
and only producing a small amount of faeces each time.

This type of obstruction is more common in people who have had previous radiotherapy
of the abdomen, and previous surgery in the abdomen.

How is it diagnosed?
If you have symptoms that suggest a possible bowel obstruction, your doctor will want
to examine you and arrange some tests.



During a physical exam, your doctor will listen to the sounds in your abdomen. He
or she might also feel inside your rectum for anything unusual. This is called a digital
rectal examination or DRE.





If you are a woman you might also need a vaginal examination, especially if you have
endometriosis.





An x-ray or other type of scan can usually detect an obstruction and what has caused
it.





A biopsy can show whether the obstruction is caused by a tumour. A small amount of
tissue is taken using a needle, and tested for cancer cells. Your faeces can be tested
to see if there is blood in it.





A test called a contrast enema can show a blockage. This test can also clear some
types of obstruction that are not caused by a tumour.



What treatments work?
If you are diagnosed with a large bowel obstruction you will not be allowed to eat
or drink anything until your doctor knows more about what has caused the problem,
and probably not until you have been treated.

You probably won’t feel like eating anyway. And you can be given fluids through an
intravenous (IV) drip. You might also need to have:



oxygen to breathe, to help make sure that you have enough oxygen in your blood.




a blood transfusion - again, to increase the amount of oxygen in your blood intravenous
antibiotics.





a catheter installed to drain urine and make sure that your body is making it normally.




the contents of your stomach and the part of your bowel above the blockage removed.
This is done using nasogastric decompression. A tube in inserted through your nose and the contents of your stomach are gently
sucked out. This means you can have surgery more safely, and it should also make you
feel more comfortable.



Everyone with a large bowel obstruction will need some kind of procedure or operation
to clear the obstruction. But if your bowel is perforated (torn) you will probably
need emergency surgery, because perforation can cause an infection.

Different procedures are used to treat different types of blockage. For example, if
you have an obstruction caused by bowel cancer, you will need surgery to remove the
part of the bowel affected by the tumour.

The type of surgery you have will depend on how far your cancer has spread and on
how ill you are. Some people with bowel cancer can be completely cured.

But if someone’s cancer has spread far beyond the bowel, and they are too ill to have
major surgery and can’t be cured, they might have what’s called palliative care. This
means making them as comfortable as possible.

If your obstruction is caused by a twisted bowel, you will probably need surgery to
remove the part of the bowel that is twisted.

If you have a blockage caused by narrowing of the bowel, you might just need a procedure
to gently open up the compressed area.

People with other types of blockage, such as those caused by diverticular disease
and endometriosis, often, but not always, need to have surgery to remove the obstruction.

What will happen?
Having a large bowel obstruction usually means having major surgery. This can be life
changing, at least for a while after the operation.

For example, some people need a colostomy after surgery. If you have a colostomy, the surgeon makes a hole in your abdomen.
Part of your bowel is then attached to this hole.

Waste from your bowel then passes out through the hole in your abdomen, instead of
passing out through your rectum. The waste is collected in a bag. Not everyone will
need a colostomy. And some people only need it temporarily, while their bowel heals.

You might worry about having a colostomy. But you'll get plenty of help learning to
cope. Modern technology means that a colostomy is much less inconvenient than it used
to be.

For example, the bags are small and they don't show through your clothes. They usually
have a filter, so they don't smell. And a colostomy shouldn't stop you from doing
things you did before, such as playing sport.

Many people recover well after surgery for a large bowel obstruction. But it is a
major operation, and there are risks. For example, the bowel can perforate (tear),
causing an infection.

Sepsis can also sometimes happen. This is when the body’s immune system over-reacts
to an infection and begins to attack the body. Your doctor should discuss all the
possible outcomes with you, as well as what can be done if they happen.

If you have bowel cancer your doctor will monitor you for at least 5 years after you
finish treatment. You will occasionally need a test called a colonoscopy. A tiny camera
on the end of a long, thin tube is inserted into the rectum so that your doctor can
check for any problems.

If your large bowel obstruction was caused by something else, your doctor will explain
whether you need monitoring and what this will involve."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/3000263/Labyrinthitis,Labyrinthitis,"Labyrinthitis Last published: Feb 07, 2022
Labyrinthitis is swelling of the inner ear, which often happens after an infection.
It causes severe dizziness and sometimes hearing loss, although this is often temporary.

Depending on what has caused your labyrinthitis, it can often be treated easily with
few or no long-term effects. You can use our information to talk to your doctor about
the best treatments for you.

What is labyrinthitis?
Most ear infections happen in the middle part of the ear. These are common in children and usually clear up by themselves.

But labyrinthitis is an infection of the inner ear. This part of the ear plays an important part in balance. So swelling in this area
can make you feel dizzy and unsteady.

Labyrinthitis can happen at any age. In adults it is usually caused by a virus, while in very young children the infection is often caused by bacteria. Viral labyrinthitis is the most common kind.

Viral labyrinthitis
Labyrinthitis is usually caused by infection with a virus. Viral labyrinthitis is the most common type of labyrinthitis and the easiest to treat. It’s sometimes
called serous labyrinthitis. It often happens after you have had an infection of the upper airways (chest or
throat).

Although viral labyrinthitis can cause hearing loss, it is usually less severe than
the hearing loss caused by other types of labyrinthitis, and your hearing usually
recovers.

Other causes of labyrinthitis
Bacterial labyrinthitis (also called suppurative labyrinthitis) is much less common than the viral kind. It usually only affects one ear. The hearing
loss that happens with this kind of labyrinthitis is usually permanent.

Meningogenic labyrinthitis happens when someone has meningitis. Fortunately, meningitis is rare these days, and many countries have vaccination
programmes to prevent it. As with bacterial labyrinthitis, any hearing loss is usually
permanent.

Autoimmune labyrinthitis is a rare condition that happens when the body’s immune system attacks the inner ear by mistake. It can sometimes be treated, but in some people
it can cause permanent hearing loss.

Syphilitic labyrinthitis is a rare complication of syphilis that can happen many years after someone is first
infected.

HIV-associated labyrinthitis is one of many infections that can happen to people with HIV and AIDS.

What are the symptoms?
The main symptoms of labyrinthitis are:


vertigo. This means that you feel dizzy, as if everything around you is spinning.
People with labyrinthitis often struggle to walk in a straight line



nausea and vomiting


hearing loss, which is often on one side only, and


tinnitus (ringing in the affected ear or ears).


If your doctor thinks that you might have labyrinthitis they will probably ask you
questions about your symptoms.

These questions can help your doctor to tell if you have labyrinthitis or a different
problem: for example, labyrinthitis is often confused with another, less serious ear
condition called vestibular neuritis. Your doctor might ask:



Can you describe your dizziness? Does the room spin, or is it more like floating or
being light headed?



What happened during your first episode of vertigo? How long did it last?


How long do your dizzy spells last now?


Have you ever had dizzy spells before?


Do you have any other symptoms apart from dizziness: for example, hearing loss, ringing
in your ears, or a feeling of fullness in your ears?



Does your dizziness get better or worse if you change position: for example, if you
lie down?



Do you have any history of headaches or migraines?


Have you started any new (or changed any) medications? Some medications can cause
dizziness.



What makes your dizziness better or worse?


Have you recently had an upper respiratory tract infection (chest or throat infection)?


Tests for labyrinthitis
Your doctor might suggest some tests to check how severe your vertigo and any hearing
loss are. For example, they may suggest checking your balance by:



seeing how well you walk in a straight line, and


whether you can stand steadily with your eyes closed.


Your doctor might suggest testing your hearing by:


holding a tuning fork near your ears, to see which is most affected, and


doing a general hearing exam.


If your doctor thinks that your labyrinthitis has been caused by meningitis, you will
need other tests, and you are likely to need emergency care to treat the meningitis.
But this type of labyrinthitis is rare.

What treatments are available?
Viral labyrinthitis is usually treated with medicines that help to relieve the symptoms. For example:



Vertigo (dizziness) can be treated with various medications. Some of these can cause side
effects, so you will usually only be given them for short periods. Your doctor should
discuss any possible side effects with you. Most people find that vertigo symptoms
get better within about three days.



Nausea can be treated with medicines called anti-emetics. These medicines help to reduce the feeling of nausea. You may also need to have
fluids given directly into a vein if you have been vomiting a lot, because vomiting
can make you dehydrated.



Hearing loss, if it occurs, can be treated with a short course of corticosteroid pills. Corticosteroids are powerful anti-inflammatories, which help to reduce the inflammation (swelling)
in your inner ear so that you can hear properly again. These drugs can cause side
effects in some people, but these usually only happen when you take them for a long
time. Your doctor should explain the possible side effects to you.



Bacterial labyrinthitis can be treated with the same medicines as viral labyrinthitis. But you will also
need treatment with antibiotics to kill the bacterial infection.

Autoimmune labyrinthitis is also often treated with corticosteroids and with medicines that reduce vertigo.

Syphilitic labyrinthitis needs treatment with antibiotics. You will probably also be referred to a specialist.

Rehabilitation for persistent vertigo
Vertigo symptoms usually clear up within a few days. But some people find that they
take much longer to go away, or that they don’t seem to go away at all.

For these people, rehabilitation can often help. This rehabilitation can involve:


physiotherapy, to help you manage with walking and general movement, and


occupational therapy, to help you manage the normal activities of everyday life.


What to expect in the future?
Most people with viral labyrinthitis recover well, and many will recover their hearing.
But recovery from bacterial labyrinthitis, and from labyrinthitis caused by meningitis,
can be more difficult. For example, even with treatment, the hearing loss caused by
bacterial labyrinthitis is usually permanent.

Some people don’t recover well from tinnitus (ringing in the ears). Tinnitus might sound like a minor complaint, but it can be
extremely stressful. Some people find that it affects their quality of life and leads
to depression.

If you struggle with tinnitus, talk to your doctor. There are many treatments for
tinnitus these days, and your doctor can help you find what works best for you.

For more information on treatments that can help, see our leaflet: Tinnitus.

Some people with viral labyrinthitis find that they have repeat episodes of vertigo. If this happens, talk to your doctor, as you may need more treatment.

If you have had labyrinthitis after meningitis your doctor should follow up regularly
with you, to check that you don’t have further problems with your ears.

There are various support groups and charities that help people affected by labyrinthitis.
For example, in the UK, Labyrinthitis.org.uk offers information and support to people with labyrinthitis and their families.

Your doctor might be able to help you find a group near you, or you could easily search
online."

This information tells you what to expect when you have surgery to replace a knee.
It explains how the operation is done, how it can help, what the risks are, and what
to expect afterwards.

Different hospitals do things in slightly different ways, so your operation might
not happen exactly as we describe it. You can use our information to discuss your
surgery with the doctors and nurses treating you.

What is knee replacement surgery?
A knee replacement is usually used as a treatment for severe problems caused by a
type of arthritis called osteoarthritis.

During a knee replacement, a surgeon removes the parts of your knee that have been
damaged by arthritis. These damaged parts are then replaced with new parts made of
metal and plastic. Together, these artificial parts are called a prosthesis or a prosthetic knee joint.

Your knee joint has three parts:

the thigh bone (femur),


the shin bone (tibia), and



the kneecap (patella).


Your knee joint is a type of joint called a hinge joint, because your knee moves in the same way that a hinge on a door allows a door to
move.

Where your knee bones meet, they are covered in a hard, slippery material called cartilage that helps them slide over each other easily.

The whole joint is held together with tough bands of tissue called ligaments, and is lubricated with a natural fluid.

Arthritis damages the surfaces where the three parts of your knee slide over each
other. This damage can:


cause pain, which can be severe


stop your knee from bending properly


weaken the knee, and sometimes


bend the knee out of shape.

During a knee replacement operation, the surgeon will replace at least two of the
following parts of the knee joint:


the bottom of your thigh bone (femur)


the top of your shinbone (tibia)


the back of your kneecap (patella).

There are two types of knee replacement.

A total knee replacement resurfaces your whole knee.



A partial knee replacement resurfaces only the inner or outer half of your knee.


Partial knee replacements only work for people with arthritis in one half of the knee
(for most people this is the inner half, nearest your other leg).

A partial knee replacement usually means that you can move your knees again sooner
than after a total knee replacement. You might also be able to go home from hospital
sooner.

Why might I need a knee replacement?
Most people with osteoarthritis of the knee don’t need a knee replacement. But your
doctor might suggest that you have one if:


you are in pain most of the time and it is getting worse


your pain stops you from sleeping


you can't walk properly


your arthritis affects your quality of life by stopping you from doing things you
normally do, such as working, seeing friends and family, gardening, doing housework,
or shopping



your arthritis is making you rely more than you want to on other people


other treatments such as painkillers, physiotherapy, or physical aids either haven’t
worked, or they caused severe side effects



your pain is making you anxious or depressed, or


your knee keeps giving way or locking up.

What happens during the surgery?
A knee replacement is a major operation. It takes between 60 and 90 minutes.
You will need either a general anaesthetic or an epidural so that you don’t feel anything during the operation.


With a general anaesthetic you sleep through the operation.


An epidural is an injection into your spine. The lower part of your body will be numb
but you’ll be awake. You won't be able to see the surgery, but you will be able to
hear what's going on. A nurse or anaesthetist will probably talk to you from time
to time, to ask how you are and let you know what’s happening.


Here’s what happens during the surgery.

The surgeon makes a long cut, usually over the front of the knee.


The surgeon then trims the bottom end of your thigh bone (femur) to remove the damaged
surface. It’s then shaped to fit the metal part of the knee replacement.



The damaged top end of your shin bone (tibia) is cut off to make a flat surface so
that the lower part of the new joint can be fitted.



The new parts are fitted over both bones and tested to make sure that they fit and
that the joint works well. The new parts are often cemented in place, but this depends
on which products your surgeon uses. Some replacement knee parts don’t need cement.



Some people have a new surface fitted onto the back of the kneecap.


If you are having only half of your knee replaced, the surgeon will only prepare and
fit the new parts over the damaged half.



When the new parts are fitted and working, the surgeon will close the wound using
stitches or clips.


What are the risks?
There are risks with all operations, and your surgeon should talk through these before
your surgery.

Anaesthetics
One common cause of problems is anaesthetics, which can have side effects, including feeling nauseous (sick) for a while after
your operation.

Some people have an allergic reaction to the anaesthetic. You should tell your doctor before the operation about any allergies
you have.

Anaesthetics can also cause breathing problems and heart problems. These problems
are serious but rare. Your blood pressure, heartbeat, temperature, and breathing will
be closely monitored during your operation.

Other possible problems
As with many types of operation, some problems can happen during or soon after surgery,
while others happen over the longer term.

This list of possible problems might look long. But remember, these are things that
might happen, not things that definitely will happen. Many people who have knee replacements
have no problems at all.

Possible short-term problems

Blood clots (deep vein thrombosis, or DVT). Getting a blood clot in one of the veins in the leg is not uncommon with this operation.
But these blood clots don’t usually cause problems, and most people never know they
have had one. If you have a blood clot that causes symptoms you will need treatment
with blood-thinning drugs.



A blood clot in your lungs. A blood clot that forms in the leg can sometimes travel through your blood to your
lungs. This is more serious and can even be fatal.To help prevent blood clots in your legs or lungs, you will probably be given elastic
stockings to wear after your operation. These stockings help to keep the blood flowing
in your legs.You might also be given blood-thinning drugs during your stay in hospital, to help
stop clots from forming.



Blood transfusions. Some people need a blood transfusion to replace blood lost during the operation.



Damage to the nerves in your leg. It’s rare, but nerves in your leg can be damaged during this type of surgery. This
causes numbness and tingling in your leg, and sometimes weakness in your ankle or
foot. Most people make a full recovery in time.



A heart attack, stroke, or chest infection. Any major operation puts a strain on your heart, brain, and chest. These problems
are rare with this surgery but they do happen.These problems are more likely to happen if you already have heart or lung problems.
It is a good idea to stop smoking before an operation, as this makes these problems
less likely.



Wound infection. If the skin and tissue underneath the wound become red and sore, it could be a sign
of infection. If you have an infection you will be treated with antibiotics.If the infection spreads to the knee replacement, you might need an operation to clean
out the joint. In the most severe cases, an operation might be needed to remove the
replacement.



Bladder problems and urine infections. Some people (especially men) who have knee surgery have problems urinating immediately
after surgery. This is caused by the anaesthetic. If this happens, you might need
a small tube called a catheter inserted into your bladder to drain the urine.Problems passing water can lead to urine infections, which are treated with antibiotics.



Dying during or after the operation. There is a risk of dying with any major operation. About 1 in 100 people who have
a knee replacement die within a month of the surgery.


Possible longer-term problems

Your knee gives way or buckles. Doctors call this instability. It's painful and can interfere with your daily life. It also increases the wear
and tear on your new knee. If your knee starts to give way, you might need a second
operation to make it more stable. Or you might need another knee replacement.



Ongoing pain. If your knee is still giving you pain after your operation, your surgeon will try
to find out why. Sometimes there isn’t a clear reason. The pain usually goes away
but it can take many months.



Your new leg might be shorter than the other one. This is rare. But if it happens you can wear shoes with one raised heel to stop
you from limping.



You have problems bending your knee. If this happens, you might need to have physiotherapy.



The new knee stops working as it should. This is rare. But if it happens your surgeon will need to investigate. You might
need another operation.



You need a second knee replacement. Your new knee should last for about 20 years. But some people need one sooner than
that. This is usually because the knee prosthesis has worked loose from the bone.
If this happens, your knee will become painful and feel unstable.You might be able to have a second knee replacement. But second operations are more
difficult to do, and problems are more likely.



An infection in the knee joint. Very rarely, new knees can become infected months or years after surgery. If antibiotics
don’t help, you might need an operation to clean out the joint.



Your artificial joint has to be removed. This can happen after a severe infection. If it happens, you might need an operation
to fasten the bones around your knee joint together. This means that you won't be
able to bend your knee. But you will be able to put weight on your leg, and you shouldn't
get any pain.


What can I expect afterwards?
A total knee replacement is a major operation and you will need time to recover.
You will have a large cut on your knee, which will be closed with stitches or clips
and covered with a waterproof dressing. A nurse will take out your stitches or clips
after about 10 days.

The pain of your arthritis should be gone quite soon after your operation, but it
could be a few weeks or even months before you feel completely normal.

You are likely to have some pain immediately after the operation, but you will be
given painkillers. If these don’t help enough, you must tell a nurse or doctor, as
pain can slow your recovery.

Immediately after your operation
When you leave the operating theatre you will go to the recovery area until you are fully awake.

You will have a drip in your arm, and possibly one or two small plastic tubes coming
out of your knee. These are drains. They stop fluid from collecting under your scar. The drip and the drains come out
after 1 or 2 days.

If you had an epidural anaesthetic, you might not be able to feel or move your legs for several hours after
your operation. This is normal. You won't have any pain either.

While recovering in hospital
You should start physiotherapy the day after your operation, when you should be able to sit on the side of your
bed and move your knee. You will have physiotherapy every day until you leave hospital,
and perhaps for longer.

Your knee will feel stiff at first but you should be able to walk with a frame or
sticks after a few days.

You should be able to go home 3 to 5 days after your operation.
Going home
When you get home, you will probably still need a frame, crutches, or walking sticks to help you get about for a while.

It's important to carry on with the exercises that your physiotherapist showed you in hospital.

You don't need to worry about sleeping in a special position after a knee replacement.
But you should avoid sex for about 6 weeks after your operation.

You can drive again after about 6 weeks, and even go back to work if you have an office job. But
if your work involves a lot of standing or lifting, you should stay off work for longer
- usually about 3 months.

Looking after your new knee
There are some simple but important things about your recovery that your doctor and
physiotherapist should discuss with you before you go home. For example:


do keep doing your physiotherapy exercises, but don’t force your knee to do things that
aren’t comfortable



do avoid twisting your knee



don’t cross your legs for 6 weeks after the operation



don’t kneel on your new knee until your surgeon says it’s okay, and finally



do tell your doctor or surgeon if you have any problems with your new knee."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/3000221/Knee%20injections,Knee injections,"Knee injections Last published:  Jun 23, 2021
People usually have a knee injection to help with joint problems like arthritis, or
to have fluid removed from around the knee, for testing.

This information tells you what happens when you have an injection in your knee, including
whether it will hurt, how it might help, and what the risks are. You can use our information
to talk with your doctor about this procedure.

Why might I need a knee injection?
Some people have injections in the knee to help with swelling or pain. For example,
drugs called corticosteroids are sometimes injected into the knee to help with arthritis, or after an injury.

But knee injections are also used to take samples of fluid from around the knee for
testing. Taking fluid with a needle in this way is called aspiration.

You might need this test if you have symptoms that suggest certain medical problems.
For example, it can help to diagnose conditions including:



septic arthritis. This is an infection of the knee joint, which needs urgent treatment with antibiotics.
The symptoms are a red, swollen, stiff, and painful knee



gout. This is a type of arthritis that can cause problems such as pain and swelling when
tiny crystals build up around the joint



osteoarthritis. This is the most common type of arthritis, which often happens as people get older
and their joints suffer from wear and tear



other types of arthritis. Arthritis can develop for many reasons: for example, after an infection elsewhere
in the body.



What will happen?
Whether you are having an injection of medication or having fluid taken for testing,
the procedure will feel the same.

The doctor will:


clean your knee using an antiseptic wipe


insert the needle into the soft tissue at the side of the knee


either inject the medication you need, or take some fluid into the syringe. This might
take a minute or so



withdraw the needle, and


apply a small dressing or plaster over the place where the needle went in.


What are the risks?
Although it’s a short procedure, a knee injection can be a bit painful at the time.
And corticosteroid injections can cause dull pain for several hours afterwards.

Other complications from this procedure are rare, but they can happen. Your doctor
should explain all the possible complications to you before you have the procedure.
They include:



bleeding


infection


damage to the joint if you have frequent injections of corticosteroids. You and your
doctor should discuss the balance between the benefits and possible problems with
these injections. Your doctor is likely to recommend that you have only a few injections
in your knee each year.



Is there anyone who should not have an injection in the knee?
Your doctor should ask you some questions before you have the injection, to make sure
that it is safe for you. For example, you might not be able to have this procedure
if you:



have a skin infection that could spread to the joint if you have an injection


have a condition that means that your blood doesn't clot normally, such as haemophilia


are taking medication to stop your blood from clotting too easily


might have a fractured knee


have diabetes that is poorly controlled, or


have a weakened immune system. This is called being immunocompromised.



What can I expect afterwards?
If your injection has been to test the fluid in your knee, your doctor should arrange
a follow-up appointment to discuss the results.

The follow-up appointment is also a chance for the doctor to check on any complications
that might have been caused by the procedure.

If you have had a corticosteroid injection, your doctor should tell you how long the injection will take to work, and how long
the pain-killing effects should last.

These injections usually take a few days to start working, and the effects last from
a few weeks to a few months, depending on the medication used. Your doctor will be
able to tell you more.

Your doctor should also caution you that corticosteroid injections can vary a lot
in how well they work. They can sometimes make a big difference, while other times
they don’t seem to work at all."

Having a kidney stone can be painful and distressing. Most stones pass out of the
body without any treatment.

What are kidney stones?
Kidney stones are solid, stone-like lumps that can form in your kidneys. They are
made from waste chemicals in your urine.

Kidney stones can stay in your kidneys without causing problems. But some might travel
out of your body in the flow of urine.

Very small kidney stones can pass out of your body without you noticing. But larger
ones can rub against the tubes carrying urine from your kidneys to your bladder (the
ureters) and even get stuck. This can be extremely painful.

There are four main types of kidney stone:


The most common type contains calcium. These stones are called calcium oxalate stones
and calcium phosphate stones.



Uric acid stones form if there is too much uric acid in your urine. Uric acid is a
waste product made when food is digested.



Struvite stones develop after a urinary infection, such as cystitis.


Cystine stones are caused by a rare inherited condition called cystinuria.


Your doctor might recommend having tests to find out what kind of stone you have.


What are the symptoms?
The main symptom is pain. This can be a dull ache in your back or side, or an extremely
sharp, cramping pain. The pain usually comes on suddenly. It might spread down to
your abdomen or groin. You might also:



feel sweaty


feel nauseous or vomit


need to urinate more often or feel a burning sensation when you urinate.


If your doctor suspects that you have a kidney stone, you will have blood and urine
tests to check for signs of bleeding, infection, and other possible problems.

Having traces of blood in your urine is a common sign of a kidney stone. This is caused
by the stone rubbing against the walls of the ureter. The blood isn't usually visible
but shows up on tests.

You'll also need an imaging test to check for a stone. The most common is a type of
x-ray called a CT scan. If you have a kidney stone, the scan might show the stone's
size and location.

If the scan does not show a kidney stone, you will probably have more tests to find
out what's causing the pain.

You might not get any symptoms with a kidney stone. You might find out you have one
when you have a scan for another reason.

What treatments work?
Treatments to help stones pass
Stones that are less than 1 centimetre across often pass out of the body without any
treatment. It can take several weeks to pass a stone, although some pass much sooner.

You can help the process along by drinking plenty of water to increase the flow of
urine. Your doctor might also prescribe strong painkillers for the pain.

You might need medicines called anti-emetics if you are feeling nauseous and vomiting.
Also, it's not uncommon for people with kidney stones to have a urinary tract infection.
If you have an infection, your doctor will prescribe antibiotics.

If you have a stone stuck in a tube (ureter), your doctor might recommend taking a
medicine called an alpha-blocker. This type of drug is often used to treat high blood
pressure or symptoms of an enlarged prostate. It can also help stones to pass by relaxing
the muscles of the ureters.

Your doctor might ask you to catch the stone with a tea strainer or something similar
as it comes out. This is so your doctor can see what type of stone you have. Knowing
the type of stone might help your doctor work out what you can do to prevent more
stones.

You probably won't need to be admitted to hospital while you're passing a stone, although
you might need scans to check on the progress of the stone.

However, if you have signs of infection (such as a fever), you should seek treatment
straight away. This is because you could get a life-threatening problem called urosepsis,
in which an infection in your urinary tract spreads to your bloodstream.

Treatments to break up or remove stones
You'll need other treatments for larger stones and those that don't pass out of the
body.

One of the main treatments is called extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL).
It uses shock waves to break up stones into small pieces that can pass out of the
body. Many stones are treated this way and it avoids any operation.

With ESWL you might sit in a tub of water or lie on a table to have shock wave treatment.
You'll have a local anaesthetic to numb the area that's being treated.

You might need several treatments to break up hard or large stones. The risk of side
effects after this treatment is small. But you could get bleeding, an infection, or
fragments of stones blocking the ureter.

Sometimes people need a minor procedure or operation if other treatments haven't worked
or if their stone is very large or in an awkward place.

In one treatment, called a ureteroscopy, the doctor inserts a long, thin wire into
your urethra, up through your bladder and into one of your ureters, to remove the
stone or break it up with a laser. (The urethra is the tube that carries urine out
of your body.)

In another treatment, called a percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL), the doctor makes
a small cut in your back to pass a needle and a very thin tube into your kidney to
remove the stone.

People usually go home from hospital the same day that they have these treatments.
Rarely, people need a larger operation and need to stay in hospital.

Extra treatment to drain blocked urine
If a stone is blocking the flow of urine, you might need extra treatment to drain
the urine from your kidney. This can be done by having a thin tube called a stent
put into your urethra and up past the blockage. Another treatment involves putting
a small, flexible tube called a catheter through your skin and into your kidney to
drain the urine.

What will happen to me?
Treatments for kidney stones usually work well. But you may get them again. If you've
had a kidney stone, you have:



a 5 in 10 chance of getting another one within five years


an 8 in 10 chance of getting another one within 10 years.


The most important thing you can do to prevent more stones is to drink plenty of water.
Doctors often recommend drinking more than 2 litres a day. Your doctor may also prescribe
medicines to help stop more stones forming.

Your chance of getting more stones may also be affected by what you eat. For example,
eating citrus fruits might help to stop new stones from forming. Experts also recommend:




eating a healthy diet, with plenty of fruit, vegetables, fibre, and calcium (but not
calcium supplements)



avoiding too much salt


not eating too much meat and other sources of protein.


If you've had a calcium oxalate stone, you might need to reduce the amount of oxalate
in your diet. This means cutting down on chocolate, nuts, rhubarb, spinach, coffee,
and tea.

If you've had a uric acid stone, you should limit your intake of foods high in urate.
These include poultry skin, herring with skin, anchovies, sprats, and animal organs
(such as liver, kidneys, brains, and sweetbreads).

You might also need to limit these foods if you have a calcium oxalate stone related
to high urate levels.

However, it's important to talk to your doctor before making big changes to what you
eat."

Having a kidney infection can make you feel very ill. But if you get the right treatment
you should make a quick recovery.

What happens in a kidney infection?
Your kidneys make urine from water and your body’s waste products. Most kidney infections
start when bacteria get into your urethra, the tube you use to pass urine. When this
happens the bacteria can spread to infect one or both kidneys.

Most people with a kidney infection can be treated at home. But you might need treatment
in hospital if you:



are very unwell


have kidney stones or other conditions affecting the kidneys


are pregnant


are older than 60.


Anyone can get a kidney infection. But certain things make it more likely. These are
called risk factors. For women, risk factors for kidney infections are the same as
for bladder infections (cystitis). They include:



having sex often


using a spermicide for contraception


having had cystitis or another urine infection in the last year


having diabetes.


What are the symptoms?
Most people with kidney infections feel very ill. The symptoms usually come on over
a few hours. You might have:



a high temperature (fever)


shivering


pain in your side or pelvis


back ache


nausea, vomiting


diarrhoea


the need to urinate more, and urinating might be painful


cloudy or strong-smelling urine


urine that's a different colour from usual.


Older people often get different symptoms from a kidney infection. These could be:


a fever with no other symptoms


confusion and sluggishness


loss of appetite, or


just feeling generally unwell.


You’ll need a urine test to check for signs of infection. You might also need a blood
test. Some people need further tests, such as an x-ray, ultrasound, or CT scan.

What treatments work?
The usual treatment for a kidney infection is antibiotics. Antibiotics are drugs that
kill bacteria. Most people can take their antibiotic tablets at home. But some people
need to have antibiotics as an intravenous (IV) drip in hospital.

Medicines
If you're well enough to be treated at home you'll be given antibiotic tablets to
take. You'll probably take tablets for one or two weeks, depending on how severe your
infection is. Some doctors recommend taking antibiotics for at least 10 days.

You should start to feel better within two days and be completely better in two weeks.
You should always finish your tablets, even if you're feeling better before then.

If you need to be treated in hospital you might be given intravenous (IV) antibiotics
through a drip in your arm. The antibiotics work quickly when given like this because
they go straight into your bloodstream.

Things you can do for yourself
Kidney infections can be painful. You might want to take painkillers, such as paracetamol
or a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), such as ibuprofen.

You should also drink plenty of fluids.
What will happen to me?
Most people get better completely with treatment. Your doctor should check to see
if you are getting better in one or two days. Tell your doctor if you don't feel a
lot better by then.

Sometimes the bacteria causing the infection have become resistant to the antibiotic
you've been given. If that happens, the antibiotic treatment will not work and your
doctor will change you to a different antibiotic.

Some people get a build-up of pus in their kidney, called an abscess. If this happens
you might need an operation to remove the pus.

Two serious but rare complications of kidney infections are sepsis and kidney failure.
Sepsis is caused by bacteria getting into your bloodstream. Kidney failure is when your kidneys stop working. If either of these things happens, you’ll need
treatment in hospital.

Some people get repeated kidney infections, which can cause kidney damage. For these
people doctors sometimes recommend taking a small dose of an antibiotic every day
to prevent repeated infections.

People who have repeat infections, or infections that don't get better with antibiotics,
might need tests to find out what is causing the infections."

Kidney cancer (also known as renal cancer) can usually be cured if it’s found early.
Like many types of cancer, kidney cancer tends to be more common in older people.

You can use our information to talk to your doctor about what treatments are best
for you.

What is kidney cancer?
The cells that make up the organs in our body usually grow, die off, and replace themselves
in a regular way. But when cells grow out of control they can form clumps called tumours.
This is what we call cancer.

Tumours can sometimes grow on the kidneys, and these tumours can spread into nearby
tissues and organs.

This information covers the most common type of kidney cancer called renal cell carcinoma. There are other types, but they are less common. Your doctor should discuss with
you what type of cancer you have, and what treatments are available.

Most kidney cancers are diagnosed at an early stage, when they can usually be cured.
Broadly speaking, kidney cancers are grouped into three stages.



Early-stage or ‘localised’ cancer. More than half of kidney cancers are diagnosed at this early stage.



Locally advanced cancer. This means that the cancer has spread to tissues close to the kidney, such as the
blood vessels that serve the kidney. About 20 in 100 cancers are diagnosed at this
stage.



Advanced or ‘metastatic’ cancer. This means that the cancer has spread to tissues and organs far from the kidney,
such as the lungs. About 20 in 100 cancers are diagnosed at this stage.



What causes kidney cancer?
One of the main causes of kidney cancer is smoking. This is because many of the chemicals that we eat, drink, or breathe in pass through
the kidneys on their way out of the body in our urine. Tobacco smoke contains many
harmful chemicals that cause cancer.

Other things that make someone more likely to get kidney cancer include:


being a man. Kidney cancer is more common in men than in women, and it tends to be diagnosed
later in men than in women



being very overweight. Kidney cancer is more common in people who are classed as obese



having high blood pressure. But doctors aren’t really sure which way around it works - whether high blood pressure
makes kidney cancer more likely, or whether the cancer causes the high blood pressure



being older. Most people with kidney cancer are over 60



having had treatment for kidney disease in the past, such as dialysis or a kidney transplant


having any close relatives who have had kidney cancer (doctors call this having a
‘family history’ of a condition).



Your specialist cancer doctor (called an oncologist) will give your cancer what’s
called a TNM classification. This is a system that helps your treatment team to understand what treatments you
might need. It’s a complex system, but put simply:



The T stands for tumour. It means how big your tumour is and how far it has spread into the kidney and the
nearby tissues.



The N stands for nodes. This refers to whether the cancer has spread into nearby glands called lymph nodes.



The M stands for metastasis. Metastasis means spreading. So this refers to whether the cancer has spread (or
‘metastasised’) into other parts of the body.



Your oncologist will give each of these letters a score based on how far and where
your cancer has spread. Your doctor should explain your TNM score to you carefully.

What are the symptoms?
Early-stage kidney cancer doesn’t usually cause any symptoms. Cancers at this stage
are often found when someone sees their doctor for another problem. They might then
have a scan, which shows up the cancer.

For example, you might have a scan if your doctor thinks you have kidney stones or,
if you are a man, the cancer might show up if you are having a scan of your prostate
gland and urinary tract (which includes the kidneys).

Kidney cancer can have symptoms, which can include:


blood in your urine


back pain


a lump in your side


fever


general tiredness


muscle weakness


swelling in the scrotum (for men).


If you have blood in your urine you might not notice if it’s a small amount. But if
you notice that your urine is a brownish colour, this is probably blood.

If you see blood in your urine, see your doctor, even if it only happens once. It
can be a sign of kidney cancer or of bladder cancer.

If you have cancer that is very advanced, symptoms can include:


pain in some of your bones and


problems with your lungs, such as a bad cough that doesn’t go away.


If a scan finds a lump on your kidney, your doctor should refer you to a specialist
called a urologist. You will need to have tests on your blood and urine.

You might also have a biopsy, which is where a small piece of the growth on your kidney
is removed and tested to see if it is cancer.

What treatments work?
The treatment you need will depend on how advanced your cancer is. But in most people
it involves removing the kidney that is affected by cancer. This usually isn’t a problem,
as the body can manage well with one kidney.

Two common cancer treatments that you might have heard of are chemotherapy (anti-cancer drugs) and radiotherapy (radiation that kills cancer cells). But these treatments don’t work well for kidney
cancer, so you are not likely to be offered them.

Early-stage cancer
The usual treatment for early-stage kidney cancer is surgery to remove the affected
kidney. This operation is called a nephrectomy. If you have a small tumour you might just need to have part of the kidney removed.

Some people have a treatment called ablation. This means killing the cancer cells with either heat or extreme cold, without removing
the kidney.



Radiofrequency ablation delivers a hot electric current through a tiny probe, which kills the cells.



Cryoablation uses extreme cold to kill the cells. Small hollow needles deliver cold liquids onto
the cancer cells, which then die.



Some people have ablation because their tumour is small and their kidney can be saved.
Others have ablation if they cannot have surgery. For example, they might be too unwell
to have a major operation.

Surgery to remove a kidney can either be done with traditional surgery or sometimes
with ‘keyhole’ surgery. The treatment you are offered will depend on the specialist
skills of the surgeons where you are treated.

Locally advanced cancer
The usual treatment for locally advanced kidney cancer is surgery to remove the affected
kidney. It might also be necessary to remove nearby lymph nodes, and sections of major
blood vessels that serve the kidneys, if they have been affected by the tumour.

Some people have treatment with so-called biological drugs. These drugs help to stop tumours growing, and they can even shrink them.

People usually have this treatment when their tumour has spread so far that surgery
is not possible. But this treatment can sometimes shrink a tumour enough so that they
can then have surgery.

These biological drugs can cause side effects. Your doctor should discuss these with
you in detail. They can include:



high blood pressure


a condition called hand-foot syndrome, which causes pain and swelling in the hands
and feet



diarrhoea


thyroid problems


liver problems, and


heart problems.


Metastatic cancer
If you have kidney cancer that is metastatic, it has probably spread too far for surgery
to be possible.

But you might be able to have surgery if your cancer has only spread to a small number
of places and if you are well enough to have major surgery.

Treatment with biological drugs can help you to live longer - sometimes a lot longer.
But metastatic kidney cancer cannot usually be cured.

What will happen?
With treatment, more than 95 in 100 people with early-stage kidney cancer are cured.
But kidney cancer can sometimes come back. If that happens you will need more treatment.

If you have had surgery to cure kidney cancer you will need to have regular check-ups
to make sure there are no cancer cells left that can spread again.

You will probably need to have a scan and possibly a chest x-ray every few months
at first, and then less often after that.

If you need to take biological drugs for a while, your doctor will want to check on
you regularly to see how you are doing, and to make sure that you are not having too
many side effects.

Biological drugs are a fairly new treatment, and they have made a huge difference
to life expectancy for kidney cancer. And treatments are still improving.

For example, people with incurable metastatic kidney cancer used to have a very short
life expectancy. But with treatment these people can now live, on average, from just
under a year to about three and a half years after diagnosis.

About 10 in 100 people with metastatic kidney cancer are cured with treatment."

Jet lag can make you feel exhausted and spoil the first few days of a holiday or business
trip. There are some simple self-help strategies that can help you cope with jet lag
and feel better. A treatment called melatonin may also help.

We've looked at the best and most up-to-date research to produce this information.
You can use it to talk to your doctor and decide which treatments are right for you.

Why do people get jet lag?
Jet lag is a side effect of long-distance air travel. When you travel by plane between
different time zones, your body clock gets left behind in the place where you started.
It can take a few days to catch up with you in your new time zone. So, for a while,
your body tries to act as if you're still in the time zone of the place you travelled
from. You may feel wide awake at night and sleepy during the day.

Your body clock is driven by daylight and a hormone in your brain called melatonin.
Melatonin tells you when to sleep. Your body starts to make melatonin when it gets
dark outside, and it stops when it gets light.

In general, the more time zones you cross, the worse your jet lag. For example, a
flight from London to Los Angeles crosses eight time zones. This means the time in
Los Angeles is eight hours behind the time in London. If you arrive in Los Angeles
at 6 p.m., your body thinks it's 2 a.m.

As a rule, flying east seems to cause more problems for most people than flying west.
What are the symptoms?
The main symptom is tiredness, which can be severe. You might also have trouble sleeping
and concentrating. And you may stop eating properly, have an upset stomach, and feel
generally unwell.

What treatments work?
Jet lag gets better on its own after a few days. Some medicines can help you feel
better faster. There are also some things you can try before and during your trip
to minimise jet lag.

Things you can do for yourself
To help prevent jet lag
There are things you can do before your trip and during your flight that may help
prevent or lessen jet lag.



Your exposure to natural light plays a big role in helping you adjust to a new time
zone. Before your trip, you might wear sunglasses to restrict your exposure to daylight
when it would be dark at your destination. You might also try to go out in the daylight
at times when it would be light at your destination.



A few days before your trip, try to adjust your sleep and meal schedule to more closely
match the schedule you will have at your destination.



Make sure you are well rested before the start of your trip.


During the flight, drink plenty of fluids but avoid alcohol and drinks with caffeine.




Avoid sleeping during the flight unless it is night time at your destination.


If your trip is short (three days or less), you might try to keep your schedule in
the new time zone as close to your home schedule as possible, to avoid jet lag when
you return. However, this may not be practical if you are crossing several time zones,
or travelling for business.



To help get rid of jet lag
Once you've arrived at your destination, there are things you can try to cope with
your jet lag and feel better faster.



Avoid caffeine after midday at your destination, where it might interfere with sleep.




Stay awake until it gets dark after a long trip going west. You might also try to
book a flight that arrives at your destination at night.



Get up when it gets light after a long trip going east. It may also help to be outdoors
in sunlight during the afternoon.



Eat small meals at the right mealtimes for your destination.


Take some light exercise, such as walking or sightseeing, during daylight. But remember
that exercising just before bedtime can sometimes make it harder to sleep.



Medicines
If your jet lag is more severe, taking melatonin tablets for a few days may help you feel better faster. The melatonin in the tablets is similar
to the melatonin your body makes at night to help you sleep. You take these tablets
when it's bedtime in your new time zone. People usually start taking them the day
before their flight.

Melatonin is sold over the counter as a supplement in some countries (such as the
US) but it is available only on prescription in others (such as the UK).

Another option is to take sleeping tablets at bedtime for the first few nights after you arrive in a new time zone. This may
help you get over jet lag more quickly.

You shouldn't use sleeping tablets for more than a few nights. Taking them for longer
can make you dependent on them. This means you can get unpleasant effects when you
stop taking the sleeping tablets, such as anxiety. You may also have problems sleeping
when you stop taking a sleeping tablet.

What will happen to me?
Jet lag is always at its worst soon after you arrive. The more time zones you cross,
the longer it will take for your jet lag to wear off. Your body clock resets by about
an hour each day if you've travelled eastwards, and about an hour and a half each
day if you've travelled westwards.

Jet lag is inconvenient. But even without treatment, it usually lasts only a few days."

You might be worried if your new baby gets jaundice. But it's not usually serious.
In most babies the jaundice goes away in a week or two without any treatment. But
sometimes the jaundice can become more serious and cause problems in the baby's brain.
It's for this reason that doctors always watch jaundice in babies very carefully,
so that they can treat it before this happens.

What treatments work?
Jaundice in newborn babies is very common, affecting as many as 70 in every 100 babies
carried full term, and 80 in every 100 babies born early (prematurely). It happens
when there is too much of a substance called bilirubin in a baby's blood. This makes
the baby's skin, the whites of their eyes, and the inside of their mouth look yellow.


Bilirubin is made naturally in the body, when red blood cells that aren't needed any
more are broken down. Usually, the liver changes the bilirubin into a form the body
can get rid of as waste. But sometimes the liver can't process all the bilirubin the
body makes. When that happens bilirubin builds up in the body and makes the skin and
the whites of the eyes look yellow.

Most babies with jaundice won't need any treatment, as their jaundice will go away
on its own in a week or two. During this time, parents are advised to be watchful
for changes to their baby's jaundice and behaviour, and to have regular checks with
their doctor.

It's also important that parents make sure their baby stays well hydrated by providing
regular, on-demand feeding. Having enough fluids will help the baby's body break down
the extra bilirubin that is causing the jaundice.

Breast milk is the best first food for most babies. But, sometimes, something in the
breast milk is thought to cause a baby's jaundice (this is called 'breast milk jaundice').
If this is the case, your doctor may recommend using formula instead of breast milk
for a short time to improve the jaundice.

If your baby's bilirubin level is especially high or increasing, your doctor will
recommend having treatment. The main options are light treatment and exchange transfusion.


Light treatment (phototherapy)
Light treatment, also known as phototherapy, is a simple treatment that works well
to get rid of jaundice.

To have light treatment, babies are usually put in a cot with special lights over
their body. The lights help the baby's body process the extra bilirubin in their blood.
The baby's eyes are covered with a mask to stop the light hurting them. Most babies
need about one or two days of light treatment.

Light treatment has very few side effects, although there's a chance your baby could
become too warm or dehydrated, or get a skin rash or a tan.

Another form of phototherapy is called fibre-optic light treatment. For this treatment,
your baby is wrapped in or placed on a blanket made of material that contains optical
fibres. Light shines down these fibres. Sometimes regular and fibre-optic light treatment
are used at the same time.

Exchange transfusion
If light treatment hasn't helped your baby, or the level of bilirubin in your baby's
blood is rising very rapidly, doctors may do an exchange transfusion.

During this treatment some of your baby's blood is taken out and replaced with blood
from a donor. This is the fastest way to reduce bilirubin levels. The transfusion
may need to be done again, depending on how much bilirubin remains in your baby's
body.

Exchange transfusion can occasionally cause some serious side effects, such as internal
bleeding. But if your baby is healthy, apart from having jaundice, they are very unlikely
to be harmed by having an exchange transfusion.

body makes. When that happens bilirubin builds up in the body and makes the skin and
the whites of the eyes look yellow.

Sometimes newborn babies get jaundice because of an underlying illness, such as an
infection or a condition called rhesus disease. Here, we discuss jaundice that isn't
related to other problems.

Most newborn babies get jaundice for two main reasons:


They produce twice as much bilirubin as adults


Their liver isn't properly developed and can't process the extra bilirubin that their
body makes.



Jaundice usually starts in the first few days after a baby is born. By the time babies
are about 2 weeks old, they make less bilirubin and the jaundice clears up.

What are the symptoms?
Newborn babies who have jaundice may get a yellow tinge to:


Their skin


The whites of their eyes


The inside of their mouth.


It can be hard to tell if a baby's skin is yellow, especially if the baby has dark
skin. That's why doctors also look at babies' eyes and inside their mouth to spot
jaundice. They often also use a device called a transcutaneous bilirubinometer, which
helps them measure the yellowness of the skin.

Babies with severe jaundice may also:


Feed less well than normal


Seem less alert and harder to wake


Have a high-pitched cry


Seem limp.


If you think your baby has jaundice and seems to be unwell, you should tell your doctor
straight away. If your doctor thinks the amount of bilirubin in your baby's blood
is building up, they will do a blood test. This will help them decide if your baby
needs treatment.

What will happen to my baby?
For most babies, jaundice goes away in a week or two without any treatment.
But if your baby's bilirubin level builds up, light treatment or an exchange transfusion
should help to clear it.

If treatments don't work and a baby's bilirubin level gets too high, it can cause
serious problems. One problem, called kernicterus, can affect your baby's brain. It
can lead to hearing loss, learning difficulties, and late development. But this kind
of problem is very rare.

Ischaemic bowel disease can happen when the blood supply to your intestines (bowels)
becomes restricted. It can come on suddenly or develop over time. Treatment can help
many people, but it is a serious condition that can be life threatening.

What treatments are available?
Like all the body’s organs, the digestive system needs a healthy supply of blood to
work properly. Blood brings oxygen and nutrients and carries away waste products.
If the blood flow to the intestines is restricted for any reason it can cause ischaemic
bowel disease. The word ‘ischaemia’ means restricted blood supply.

Ischaemic bowel disease is not one specific condition. The name covers any problems
that can be caused by reduced blood supply to the bowel. For more background information
see our leaflet Ischaemic bowel disease: what is it?
The treatment you need will depend on which blood vessels are affected and on how
severe the problem is. But many people need surgery.

Mild ischaemic bowel disease
If the blood supply to your bowel is only slightly restricted, and if there are no
signs of infection, you probably won’t need surgery. Some types of mild ischaemic
bowel disease get better by themselves.

But even if your ischaemia is mild you will need treatment to make you comfortable
and stable and to prevent the problem getting worse.

First treatments
The first treatments you will be given will be to help make you stable. They may include
oxygen via a mask and intravenous (IV) fluids. You may need a tube inserted into your
stomach or treatment to correct an irregular heart rhythm.

You will also be given antibiotics. This is because any damage to the bowels can cause
bacteria to spread quickly around the body. If you have signs of heart failure you
will also be given medicine to help your heart pump more strongly.

Surgery
Many people with ischaemic bowel disease need surgery. This is usually done either
to remove a blockage from a blood vessel or to bypass a blocked or badly damaged portion
of a blood vessel.

Both these methods can help restore a healthy flow of blood. The type of surgery you
need depends on which blood vessels are affected and how badly.

You might also need surgery if the lining of your abdomen is inflamed (this swelling
is called peritonitis), or if there is a tear in your bowel. To begin with you will
need what’s called exploratory surgery.

This means that the surgeon makes a cut in the abdomen and is then able to see clearly
any swelling and damage. He or she can then remove any badly damaged section of bowel
and repair the more healthy parts.

After surgery
If you have surgery you will need drug treatment to help your recovery. You will probably
need to take at least one of the following drug treatments. You may need to take some
of them for some weeks or months:



Antibiotics to target any specific infection that has been identified


Drugs called anticoagulants to stop your blood from clotting too easily and to help
prevent more blockages while you recover



Other drugs to help dilate (open up) narrow blood vessels to improve blood flow. You
only take these for a few days.



If you have inflamed blood vessels you may need to take powerful anti-inflammatories
called corticosteroids to help relieve the swelling.

What to expect in the future
The follow-up care that you need will depend on whether you needed surgery.
If you didn’t have surgery you may need to have tests and procedures so that your
doctor can check for any damage to your digestive system.

If you had surgery you will need regular check-ups to make sure you are healing well.
But, whether you had surgery or not, you will need check-ups so that your doctor can
look out for signs of anything that might cause another episode of ischaemia. You
will also need treatment for any other problems that might have caused the ischaemia.


You will need to be aware of the symptoms of bowel ischaemia returning. If you have
any abdominal pain, bloating, bloody stools, nausea, or vomiting, seek medical help
straight away. And it’s vital that you take your follow-up medicines as instructed
by your doctor.

Unfortunately an episode of bowel ischaemia can be fatal, especially if it was diagnosed
late and there is already a lot of damage. The chances of survival also depend on
which blood vessels are involved and how bad the blockage is.

The outlook is better for people with chronic ischaemic bowel disease. With treatment,
between 70 and 90 in 100 people survive. For people whose large intestine is affected,
rather than their small intestine, the outlook is even better.

But acute ischaemic bowel disease tends to be more serious. More than half of people
with this type of ischaemia will die."

bowel disease. The word ‘ischaemia’ means restricted blood supply.

Ischaemic bowel disease is not one specific condition. The name covers any problems
that can be caused by reduced blood supply to the bowel.

But you might hear your doctor call it either colonic or mesenteric ischaemia.



Colonic ischaemia affects the part of the bowel called the large intestine.


Mesenteric ischaemia affects what's called the small intestine. This tends to be the more serious of these two types.



These problems can have various causes, but the most common is a blood clot in an artery that leads to the bowel. These blood clots often develop near the heart,
then travel along the artery and become lodged near the bowel. Ischaemic bowel disease
is more common in people with heart disease.

Other causes of ischaemic bowel disease include:


Swollen walls in the blood vessels. The swelling narrows the blood vessels, which
reduces the flow of blood. This can be caused by conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis
and lupus



Something pressing on an artery, such as another swollen body tissue or a tumour


Other conditions that cause reduced blood flow, such as heart failure


Some medicines and some recreational drugs


An infection


Recent surgery.


Ischaemic bowel disease is more common in women than in men. It is also more common
in older people and in people who have smoked for many years.

What are the symptoms?
Ischaemic bowel disease can happen suddenly or it can develop gradually over time.
This means that the symptoms can come on suddenly and be very severe or they can be
mild to begin with and gradually get worse.



Ischaemic bowel disease that comes on suddenly is called acute ischaemic bowel disease.



Ischaemic bowel disease that comes on slowly over time is called chronic ischaemic bowel disease



Chronic ischaemic bowel disease can be hard to diagnose, as the symptoms are similar
to those of many conditions that can cause abdominal discomfort. This means that many
people are not diagnosed until they are seriously ill.

The main symptoms are:


Pain and tenderness in your abdomen (tummy)


Blood in your stools


Diarrhoea, and


Weight loss. This can happen because the pain is worse after meals, which puts some
people off eating.



If your doctor thinks you might have ischaemic bowel disease, he or she won’t be able
to tell just by examining you. You will need to have a blood test and a scan.

This might be an external scan, such as an x-ray or a CT (computerised tomography)
scan. Or you may need an internal procedure, such as a colonoscopy, where a small camera is inserted into the rectum on the end of a tube. This helps
your doctor identify the problem and see how severe it is.

The follow-up care that you need will depend on whether you needed surgery. For more

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a condition that can cause stomach pain, cramps,
bloating, constipation, and diarrhoea. There isn't a cure for IBS, but lifestyle changes
and treatments can improve your symptoms.

You can use our information to talk to your doctor and decide which treatments are
right for you. To learn more about IBS and its symptoms, see our leaflet Irritable bowel syndrome: what is it?
Lifestyle and diet
Keeping a symptom diary
Certain things in your life, such as stress and certain foods, might bring on your
IBS symptoms. Your doctor might recommend that you keep a symptom diary.

This will allow you to track when you get symptoms, so you can see whether anything
seems to trigger them. Once you identify a possible trigger, you can take steps to
avoid it.

Managing stress
Many people get flare-ups of IBS symptoms when they are feeling stressed. So taking
steps to manage stress is often one of the first treatments doctors recommend. Things
you might try include:



deep breathing exercises


meditation


yoga


relaxation classes, and


taking regular exercise.


Talking to a counsellor or joining an IBS support group might also help. Your doctor
can help you explore your options.

Changing your diet
Sometimes people with IBS have difficulty digesting certain foods, which can make
their symptoms worse. These foods can include:



dairy products


foods that contain a type of sugar called fructose, and


coffee and other drinks that contain caffeine.


You might need to cut these out of your diet completely.
With the help of a symptoms diary you might be able to identify foods that make your
IBS worse. But it's a good idea to check with a doctor or a dietitian before you make
any changes to your diet. Avoiding certain foods can make your life difficult, and
it's easy to miss out on important nutrients.

Some people find that their IBS improves when they cut out a type of carbohydrate
that is difficult for the body to absorb. These carbohydrates are called FODMAPs.
You can ask your doctor or dietitian for details on a low-FODMAP diet, or look online.

If constipation is one of your IBS symptoms, you might benefit from eating more fibre. Fibre is a bulky substance that your body can't digest. The extra bulk helps make
your stools large and soft, and helps your bowels work properly. Good sources of fibre
in foods include:



wholegrain or wholemeal foods


cereals with bran in them


vegetables, and


fresh or dried fruits.


You can also get fibre supplements from pharmacies or health food shops. Some examples
are ispaghula husk and methylcellulose. Make sure you drink plenty of water if you're
taking fibre supplements. Fibre sometimes gives people wind or makes them feel bloated.

Probiotic supplements can hep improve IBS in some people. You can buy these as yoghurts or capsules that
contain 'friendly bacteria'.

The idea is that these add to the helpful bacteria that live in your bowels and aid
in digestion. Research suggests that one type of probiotic, called Bifidobacterium infantis, might be particularly helpful in IBS.

Medicines
If lifestyle and diet changes don't do enough to improve your symptoms, medicines
can also help. These include:



anti-spasmodic drugs, which help to control the muscles around your bowel


medicines for diarrhoea


medicines for constipation, and


antidepressants.


Your medicines might change depending on what symptoms you are having (for example,
constipation or diarrhoea).

Anti-spasmodic drugs
Anti-spasmodic drugs can help with IBS, especially if your main symptom is pain. These
drugs work by relaxing the wall of your bowel.

People often take anti-spasmodic drugs for a week or so at a time when their IBS gets
bad. It's better to take these medicines when your symptoms flare up, rather than
to take them every day. Anti-spasmodics can sometimes cause side effects, such as
nausea and an irregular heartbeat.

Peppermint oil works in the same way as anti-spasmodic drugs. It might help reduce
pain and bloating. You can buy peppermint oil as drops or tablets from a pharmacy.
Peppermint oil sometimes causes heartburn as a side effect.

Medicines for diarrhoea
Doctors often recommend a drug called loperamide to treat bouts of diarrhoea in IBS.
You can buy it yourself from a pharmacy. Some people get mild side effects from loperamide.
These include dizziness, drowsiness, and bloating.

If loperamide doesn't work for you, there are other options. Talk to your doctor about
what might be best for you.

Medicines for constipation
If one of your main symptoms is constipation, you might first want to try eating more
fibre or taking fibre supplements. If these don't help, you could also try a laxative
to help you go to the toilet.

If you aren't able to take laxatives, or if over-the-counter laxatives don't help
enough, your doctor might recommend treatments available only on prescription.

Antidepressants
Some antidepressants seem to help with IBS. Your doctor might suggest an antidepressant
if you have bad IBS and other treatments haven't helped you.

You need to take an antidepressant every day for it to help. You probably won't feel
the benefits for at least two or three weeks.

Antidepressants can cause side effects, including nausea, weight gain, fatigue, and
a dry mouth. However, doctors often prescribe antidepressants at a lower dose for
IBS than for depression. So there might be less chance of side effects.

Other treatments
Some people with IBS try hypnotherapy to help them relax and cope with their symptoms. If you have this treatment, a therapist
helps you focus on your symptoms and what you can do about them while you're in a
relaxed state.

There's some research to show that hypnotherapy might help with IBS, but it can take
up a lot of time and can be expensive.

Cognitive behaviour therapy is a talking treatment (a psychotherapy). It aims to help change the way you think
about your illness and give you more control over it. Studies have suggested that
it might help people get fewer symptoms of IBS."

If you have irritable bowel syndrome, you may want to talk to your doctor to find
out more. Here are some questions that you might want to ask.


How do you know I have irritable bowel syndrome?


Could it be a more serious illness?


Do I need any tests?


Do you know what's causing it?


What treatment do I need?


What should I do if treatment doesn't work?


What medicine can I take to help with pain, diarrhoea, or constipation?


What can I do myself to help control my symptoms?


Do I need to change my diet?


Does stress make my irritable bowel syndrome worse?


Are there any alternative or complementary treatments?"
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1508590614233/Irritable%20bowel%20syndrome,Irritable bowel syndrome,"Irritable bowel syndrome Last published: Jan 30, 2023
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a condition that can cause stomach pain, cramps,
bloating, constipation, and diarrhoea. It affects about 15 in every 100 adults in
Europe. Women are more likely than men to get IBS. There is no cure, but lifestyle
changes and treatments can help relieve your symptoms.

What is it?
IBS affects your large bowel (also called your large intestine). Your large bowel
turns food your body doesn't need into solid waste, which then leaves your body when
you go to the toilet.

Doctors aren't sure exactly what happens in your body if you have IBS. But they think
that the muscles that make up the wall of your bowel don't work as well as they should.
These muscles usually tighten (contract) and relax in a coordinated way to move food
along your bowel.

But these contractions might be stronger and last longer than normal if you have IBS,
which can cause bloating, cramping, and diarrhoea. Or they might be weaker than normal,
meaning that waste stays in your bowel for longer than usual. If this happens, too
much water might be absorbed from the waste, leading to constipation.

Doctors also think that IBS could be tied to problems with how the brain communicates
with the bowel, with the wrong messages sometimes being sent to the nerves controlling
the bowel muscles. Your brain might do this when you are under stress or feeling anxious.

That doesn't mean that IBS is all in your mind - signals from your brain cause real
physical changes in your body. But it explains why your mood or emotions can affect
your IBS.

We don't know why people get IBS. There is no obvious cause that doctors can test
for. And people with IBS don't have any serious structural problem with their bowels.
There are probably several different things that act together to cause the condition.

What are the symptoms?
IBS affects people in different ways. But everyone with IBS gets pain and discomfort,
which often goes away for a while once they have a bowel movement. You might also:




Have diarrhoea or constipation, or bouts of both


Feel bloated


Have slippery, thick fluid in your stools (mucus)


Feel as if your bowel isn't completely empty after a bowel movement.


The symptoms of IBS might flare up during times of stress and emotional difficulty.
Many people get these types of symptoms from time to time. But if you have IBS you
get these symptoms much more often than most people.

Sometimes people worry that their IBS might lead to a more serious illness, like cancer.
But IBS doesn't damage your bowel or cause more serious problems.

However, the symptoms of IBS can also be symptoms of more serious illnesses, so it's
important to get them checked out. You should also make sure you see a doctor if you:



get blood in your stools


lose weight for no reason, or


feel tired all the time.


To diagnose IBS, your doctor might recommend having tests to rule out other problems.
These might include blood tests, stool tests, x-rays, or a colonoscopy.

During a colonoscopy, a doctor inserts a thin, bendy tube with a small camera on its
end into your anus. By moving the tube up into your bowel, the doctor can check for
possible problems.

Many people with IBS try to cope with their symptoms themselves. But it can make a
big difference if you talk to your doctor. Together you can find ways to improve your
symptoms through changes to your diet and lifestyle, and with treatments. To learn
more, see our leaflet Irritable bowel syndrome: what treatments work?
What will happen to me?
Your symptoms might improve in time, but IBS doesn't usually go away on its own. You
might be reassured to know that IBS doesn't damage your bowels or lead to more serious
illnesses. How badly it affects you depends largely on whether it stops you doing
the things you want to do.

Learning about your IBS might help you feel more in control and manage your symptoms
better. Joining a support group might help. Your doctor might be able to recommend
one in your area."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1524774181187/Insomnia,Insomnia,"Insomnia Last published: Sep 20, 2021
Many people get insomnia, especially as they get older. But there are things you can
do to help you get the sleep you need. Sleeping pills aren't usually advised. But
a short course can help if your insomnia is severe and making life difficult.

You can use our information to talk to your doctor and decide which treatments are
best for you.

Why can't I sleep?
Insomnia is poor-quality sleep. It can last for just a few days or weeks: for example,
if you're jet-lagged or worried about something. Or you could have chronic (long-lasting)
insomnia.

Doctors say you have chronic insomnia if you've had problems sleeping on at least
three nights a week for at least three months.

Some people don't sleep well because of a medical or mental health condition, such
as depression or anxiety. Others sleep poorly because of conditions that cause them
pain.

If you think you might be depressed, or that you may have another condition that is
disrupting your sleep, you should see your doctor. Treating the condition that is
causing your sleep problems should also help with your insomnia.

Sleep problems are more common in people aged over 65. This may be because of changes
in your body clock (your circadian rhythm) that can happen as you get older.

How long people sleep, and what they think is a normal amount to sleep, varies a lot.
Most people sleep for between six hours and eight hours a night. But you will probably
need less sleep as you get older.

What are the symptoms?
There are three main types of sleep problem:


Difficulty falling asleep. This is the most common problem.


Difficulty staying asleep. Older people are more likely to have this problem.


Early morning awakening. You may wake up early and be unable to get back to sleep.
This problem is less common.



What treatments work?
Sleeping pills can help. But if your insomnia has a specific cause they will not treat
that problem. And they have side effects.

Non-drug treatments for sleep problems may work better than medicines in the long
term, with few (if any) side effects.

Things you can do for yourself
Certain habits can stop you sleeping well, whereas good habits can help you sleep
better. You may hear your doctor refer to the good habits as good sleep hygiene. This involves:



taking some exercise during the day, but not just before you go to sleep


avoiding eating a large meal before bed


avoiding tobacco and drinks that contain caffeine or alcohol for a few hours before
bedtime



thinking about how going to the toilet during the night affects your sleep. If you
can't get back to sleep after getting up to use the toilet, try to avoid drinking
any fluids for a couple of hours before bedtime



going to bed only when you feel sleepy


using the bedroom only for sleeping and for having sex


keeping your bedroom as cool and as quiet as possible


not trying to force yourself to sleep. If you can't sleep after about 15 or 20 minutes,
go to another room. Try reading with a fairly dim light. But don't watch television
as this gives off bright light that can keep you awake. Go back to bed only when you
feel sleepy



avoiding using a computer or electronic tablet just before bed. The bright light from
these can keep you awake in the way a TV can



trying to get up at the same time every morning


trying not to nap during the day.


Cognitive behaviour therapy
Having some sessions of a talking treatment called cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT)
is likely to help you sleep better. You can have this treatment with a therapist.
You might also be able to use a booklet or have therapy over the internet.

CBT helps address negative thoughts and encourage positive thoughts for many different
conditions. For insomnia, CBT helps you change the way you feel, think, and behave
about your sleep habits.

Medicines from your doctor
If your insomnia is severe, your doctor might prescribe sleeping pills to help you
sleep better. You may find that they help you get to sleep quicker, and stay asleep
a little longer.

Doctors used to prescribe sleeping pills called benzodiazepines. But newer drugs seem
to cause fewer side effects. The newer drugs also seem to be safer to take for longer
periods than benzodiazepines.

Newer drugs can still cause side effects in some people, including drowsiness the
day after you take them. For example, some of the newer drugs can affect your ability
to drive the next day.

For some of them, men and women may react differently. You should always be taking
the lowest drug dose possible that helps you sleep.

Other side effects include dizziness, headaches, and a blocked nose. If you get any
side effects from taking sleeping pills, stop taking them and see your doctor.

Sleeping pills are not suitable for pregnant women. They should also not usually be
taken by people with a history of alcohol or drug problems.

Other treatments
Relaxation techniques and meditation work well for some people.
Some people also try complementary, herbal, or alternative treatments, such as acupuncture
or homeopathy, to help them sleep. But research suggests that they probably don't
help.

You may be able to buy some sleep treatments from pharmacies without a prescription.
Most of these contain antihistamines, which are medicines usually used to treat allergies.
There is not much evidence to suggest that they help to relieve insomnia.

What will happen to me?
Being unable to fall or stay asleep can be distressing. You may also find that you
are tired and irritable during the day and struggle to concentrate. So practising
good sleep hygiene or getting help from your doctor is important."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/3000258/Insect%20bites%20and%20stings,Insect bites and stings,"Insect bites and stings Last published: Jan 05, 2022
Bug bites and stings (we include spiders here, although they are not insects) are
common in most parts of the world, especially in the warmer months.

The effects of these bites and stings can vary in severity from harmless to fatal.
But dying from bites and stings is much more rare than most people think.

What are insect bites and stings?
Bites
A bite is when a bug uses its mouthparts, either to try to feed on you (usually on your
blood) or in defence. Some bites happen without you feeling them, while some can be
painful. Common biting insects include:



mosquitoes. Mosquitoes are found almost everywhere in the world, including Europe
and the UK. The species that carry malaria are mostly found in parts of Africa and
Asia. But many species can still give annoying bites that sometimes become infected



ticks. Ticks are mainly found in countries with warm, damp climates. They can carry
several diseases, most notably Lyme disease. Lyme disease is most commonly found in
Asia, parts of North America, central Europe, and Scandinavia. It is less common in
the UK and southern Europe



kissing bugs (assassin bugs), which are found in Central and South America, and


some flies (including horseflies).


Spider bites are much more rare than people think. Most 'spider bites' are not bites at all, but
are caused by something else, such as a minor local skin infection.

Fatal spider bites are extremely rare. Most bites from venomous spiders can be treated.
When spiders do bite people it’s a defensive reaction, often when someone sits on
them or touches them by accident. Spiders that bite include:



black widows, which are found in many parts of the world


Australian redbacks, which are found mainly, but not only in Australia, and


brown recluse spiders, which are mostly found in the southern United States.


Stings
A sting is when an insect, such as a wasp or fire ant, uses a stinger to inject venom or other
chemicals. Insects can sting in defence or attack. Stings are almost always painful.

Despite regular media stories about 'killer bees' and other dangerous bugs, deaths
from stings are rare.

For example, in the US, a country of 330 million people, about 60 people die each
year after stings from hornets, bees, and wasps.

Most of these people die because they are allergic to the stings. If you are not allergic,
these stings are unpleasant but not usually dangerous.

What are the symptoms?
Sometimes when someone is stung or bitten it’s obvious what has happened. For example,
they might have seen the bug and felt the sting.

But some bug bites happen without you knowing. The symptoms can vary. But many bites
share some of the same symptoms, which can include:



swelling, warmth, and itching around the bite


visible marks of a bite


wheal and flare: this means a raised pale area surrounded by a reddish area. This
is obviously harder to see on some skin tones.



Some bites - for example, from a black widow spider - can cause more severe symptoms.
These can include:



fever


nausea and vomiting


numbness


shaking


general pain


stomach pain


headache, and


muscle cramps.


The symptoms above are those of bug bites without a severe, systemic (whole body)
allergic reaction. The symptoms of a severe allergic reaction to a bug bite can be very different.
If you think someone is having a severe allergic reaction, get medical help straight away.

The symptoms of a severe allergic reaction can include:



wheezing, unusual breath sounds, and other breathing problems. This suggests dangerous
swelling in the airways



swelling around the lips, tongue, mouth, and throat. This is very dangerous, as it
can lead to breathing problems



a fast heartbeat (called tachycardia), and


sudden reddening of the skin.


What treatments are available?
Prevention
You can’t always avoid being bitten or stung, but there are some things you can do
to make it less likely in some situations. Depending on where you are, these could
include:



being aware of the times that bugs are most active. For example, mosquitoes are most
active around dawn and again at dusk



avoiding perfumes and scented cosmetics that might attract insects


using insect repellent where appropriate


wearing long trousers and long-sleeved tops at times when insects are most active


looking carefully before reaching around blind corners or into the backs of cabinets
to help avoid spider bites and wasp stings.



Treatment
Bites and stings that aren’t serious don’t need medical treatment. It’s normal for
swelling and itching from some bites to last up to 10 days. This can be annoying,
but it’s not serious. Simple things you can do include:



not scratching around bites and stings. Scratching bites can make the swelling worse
and can spread infection, and



using creams that reduce itching. Ask your pharmacist about what might help.


Bug bites can sometimes become infected. If this happens it will usually clear up after a few days without treatment. But
some infections need treatment with antibiotics.

Signs of an infected bite that needs treatment include:


stiffness in joints near the bite, and


redness, warmth, and swelling spreading quickly farther from the bite. Swelling and
warmth are also symptoms of a bite that is not infected. But new swelling and warmth that develop a few days after a bite is more likely to be caused by an infection.



If you have symptoms like these, seek medical attention.
Treatment for allergic reactions to bites and stings
If you have medical treatment for bug bites or stings, the first thing your doctor
will do is check for an allergic reaction.

If you have had a severe allergic reaction you will need emergency treatment. This
will probably include:



injections of adrenaline (epinephrine). This is a standard medicine for combatting all types of allergic reaction



help to breathe normally. This might involve putting a tube into your lungs (this
is called intubation), and



observation. After a serious allergic reaction your doctor will want to keep you in
hospital for at least a few hours to keep an eye on you.



Bites and stings with no allergic reaction
If you haven’t had an allergic reaction, the treatment you need will depend on how
severe your symptoms are, and on what it was that bit or stung you.

Local reactions
A local reaction just means what happens near the bite. Treatments might include:


washing the area


reducing swelling: for example, by cooling it with ice wrapped in a towel, or by elevating
(raising) the affected area, if possible



removing any stingers: for example, from bee stings, and


possibly a tetanus vaccination.


Your doctor might also suggest medicines to help. These might include:


anti-inflammatory medicines called corticosteroids. These can help to reduce swelling



antihistamines. These medicines are usually used to treat allergic reactions. But even if you haven’t
had an allergic reaction, they can help to reduce itching and swelling



simple pain relief medicines such as paracetamol, and


non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, to help reduce pain and swelling.



Black widow spider bites
Black widow bites can be fatal, but this is extremely rare. Most people get better
after treatment.

Black widow bites usually only cause pain and swelling around the bite. But this pain
can be severe, and it often needs treatment with powerful opioid painkillers.

People who have more severe reactions might also need treatment for muscle spasms and raised blood pressure.

Antivenoms for black widow bites are available. But research suggests that they probably don’t
help much.

Recluse spider bites
Recluse spider bites can usually be treated with painkillers, and with antibiotics
if they become infected.

Rarely, these bites can cause what’s called necrosis. When this happens, tissue near to the bite, such as skin and muscle, doesn’t get
enough blood flow and dies.

Necrosis can often be treated with medicine. But some people need surgery to remove
the dead tissue and to stop the necrosis from spreading.

What to expect in the future
If you have had a severe allergic reaction to a bug bite or sting, your doctor should
talk with you about what to do if it happens again.

This will probably involve you needing to carry auto-injectors. You might have heard of these being called EpiPens, although this is actually a brand name and several others are available. These devices
contain epinephrine (adrenaline). You use them to inject yourself if you have an allergic reaction.

Your doctor might also refer you to a specialist who deals in allergies.
It’s possible to have what’s called rebound reactions as your allergy medicines wear off. If this happens, and you have symptoms
such as breathing problems, or swelling or tingling in your mouth or throat, you should
return to hospital.

People recover well from most types of bug bite. For example, bites that cause only
local reactions usually get better by themselves after about 5 to 10 days.

The pain of a black widow bite can take several days to go, but long-term effects are rare.

Bites from brown recluse spiders can cause longer-term problems. These vary in severity, and can include visible scarring
caused by necrosis."

You might notice an inguinal hernia as a bulge you can see or feel in your groin.
It may be tender or uncomfortable and you may not like the way it looks. Doctors usually
recommend surgery to repair a hernia.

Hernias can happen in several different parts of your body. But this information is
about inguinal hernias, which are the most common type of hernia that happens in your
lower abdomen or groin (the word inguinal means groin).

You can use our information to talk to your doctor about which treatment approach
is right for you.

What is a hernia?
A hernia can happen if there's a weak spot in the muscles in the wall of the abdomen
(belly). A section of bowel or fatty tissue can poke through the weak spot. This causes
a bulge in your groin or the lower part of your abdomen.

Hernias happen in one of two ways:


You may have been born with a weak spot in your muscles.


Something may have damaged your muscles. This could be another medical condition.
Things like heavy lifting, a bad cough, or straining when you go to the toilet can
make hernias worse, but they don't cause them in the first place.



What treatments work?
Surgery is the only treatment for a hernia. But if your hernia doesn't cause you any
problems your doctor might suggest that you try watchful waiting. This means that you delay having surgery until your hernia is bothering you. Some
people never need to have surgery.

There are two main types of surgery that can repair a hernia.


Open surgery is done through a cut that opens up your groin.



Keyhole surgery (also called laparoscopic surgery) involves making several smaller cuts. The surgeon
works through the cuts, using a camera to see inside your groin.



You may have heard of supports or trusses to hold in a hernia. But they don't cure the problem. Doctors sometimes suggest using
them if you need to wait a while before you have surgery. But otherwise they are not
used much any more.

Open surgery
If you have open surgery your surgeon makes a cut between 5 and 10 centimetres (about
2 to 4 inches) long down the crease of your groin. He or she then pushes the hernia
back into place or cuts it away. A mesh patch is usually used to cover the weak spot
in your stomach muscles.

Stitches can be used in your muscle instead of a patch but mesh is more suitable for
most hernias. The cut in your skin will then be closed with stitches. These are usually
the kind that dissolve.

Open surgery often works best for simple hernias that are only on one side of the
body (unilateral hernias). People who have open surgery for this type of hernia are less likely than those
who have keyhole surgery to need a second operation.

Keyhole surgery
If you have keyhole surgery your surgeon makes a small cut near your belly button
(umbilicus). The cut is about a centimetre (half an inch) long. A thin tube with a
camera on the end is put through the cut. The camera sends pictures to a screen so
the surgeon can see inside your groin.

The surgeon also makes one or more small cuts lower down your abdomen. He or she puts
small tools through these cuts to push the hernia back into place. A mesh patch is
used to close the hole in your stomach muscles.

Keyhole surgery seems to work best for hernias that are on both sides of the body
(bilateral hernias). This type of surgery also seems to work better than open surgery for people whose
hernia has been operated on and has then come back (recurred).

Keyhole surgery can have some advantages over open surgery. For example, people who
have keyhole surgery tend to:



have less pain after the operation


have less scarring, and


be able to get back to their normal activities a bit sooner.


What are the benefits of surgery?
Most people with a hernia have surgery. If you don't have treatment there's a small
chance that your stomach muscles could trap the section of bowel that's poking through
and cut off the blood supply (called a strangulated hernia). This is very dangerous.

But strangulated hernias are rare in men whose hernias don't bother them and who choose
to wait before having surgery.

What are the risks?
All operations have risks. You and your surgeon should discuss these before you have
your hernia repaired.

Some people feel sick or vomit when they come round from the anaesthetic. More serious
problems, such as an allergic reaction to the anaesthetic, are rare.

Some people bleed heavily under the skin after their operation. This can cause a large
bruise called a haematoma. Some people get a build-up of fluid under their skin. This is more common with keyhole
surgery.

Sometimes the surgeon might accidentally damage an organ. For example, you could get
damage to your bladder. Damage to an organ is very rare during open surgery.

There's a small chance that your hernia will come back after surgery. You can have
another operation if this happens.

What will happen to me?
Most people with an inguinal hernia have surgery. But if your hernia is small and
you don't have any other symptoms (like a sore groin), you can talk with your doctor
about whether you need to have it repaired straight away. You might be able to wait
and see what happens before you decide about treatment.

If you decide to try 'watchful waiting' your doctor should make sure that you are
checked every six months in case your hernia is becoming more of a problem.

Choosing not to have surgery right away does not increase your chance of having problems
or of having a worse outcome from surgery in the future.

Most people recover well after surgery and only need one follow-up appointment to
check that they are healing and recovering well. But you should go back to hospital
right away if you are in a lot of pain or if you vomit. One or two in every 100 people
who have mesh surgery for a hernia will need a second operation.

You should avoid straining, heavy lifting, or strenuous exercise until you are recovered.

What are the symptoms?
The main symptom is a bulge near your groin. It may be on one side of your groin (unilateral)
or on both sides (bilateral). The bulge may get bigger when you cough, bend, lift,
or strain. You may not be able to feel it when you sit or lie down.

Your groin may feel uncomfortable or even painful, especially when you bend or lift.
Some people can push their hernia back in but it's likely to come out again. If you
have a hernia that you could push back in at one time but can't any more, make sure
you see your doctor right away.

In men, the lump can move into the scrotum (the sac that holds the testicles). This
can cause swelling and can be painful.

Some people have hernias that don't cause them any problems. It may be possible to
wait and then see if you need treatment later. However, there is a small chance that
your stomach muscles could trap the piece of bowel that's poking through and cut off
its blood supply. This is called a strangulated hernia. It's very dangerous and needs emergency surgery.

See a doctor straight away if your bulge is painful, if you feel sick or have a fever,
or if the bulge turns red, purple, or black.

What is an inguinal hernia repair?
An inguinal hernia is a bulge that you can see or feel in your groin. The word inguinal means groin. To repair the hernia, a surgeon will usually push the lump back into
place and cover it with a patch of mesh to keep it there.

The hernia is caused by a weak spot in the muscles in your abdomen. Tissue such as
fat and a section of your bowel can slip through a weak place in the muscle and down
into your groin.

Inside your abdomen, your bowel is covered by a thin film of tissue called the peritoneum. When the bowel slips through the weak spot in the muscle, this film of tissue falls
with it.

The hernia is like a pouch with fat, tissue, and bowel in the middle of the peritoneum.
Doctors call this pouch the hernia sac.

Usually, the muscles in your abdomen are tight and strong enough to keep your bowel
in place. But weak points can occur in two ways, causing two different kinds of hernia.

Both types of hernia are more common in men than in women.
Indirect hernia
If you have an indirect hernia, you are born with a weakness in the muscles in your
abdomen.

By the time boys are born, or soon after, the testicles drop from the abdomen into
the scrotum through a gap in the abdomen muscles, called the inguinal canal.

This gap usually closes soon after birth. But if the gap stays open, part of the bowel
can fall through it.

Women can have this type of hernia, too.
Direct hernia
A direct hernia happens when you strain your abdomen. It’s called a direct hernia
because the hernia pushes directly through the weak point in the muscles. This can
be caused by:



severe coughing


straining when urinating or having a bowel movement, or


lifting heavy objects.


Why might I need this operation?
There are several reasons why you might want a hernia operation.
To remove the bulge and relieve symptoms
An inguinal hernia can be uncomfortable and feel tender, especially when you bend
or lift. The symptoms might go away by themselves after a while, but you'll still
have the bulge in your groin.

In men, the lump can move into the scrotum (the bag that holds the testicles), making
it swollen and sore. Some people can feel gurgling in the part of the bowel inside
the lump. Others feel a burning sensation in their groin.

Untreated hernias can get bigger and become more painful and uncomfortable. Some people
find that it stops them playing sport or having sex.

Not everyone with a hernia has symptoms, but most people don't like having the bulge
in their groin.

To prevent a blocked bowel
The part of the bowel in the bulge can become squeezed by the small opening it has
slipped through. This can cut off the blood supply to the bowel.

If blood stops flowing to this part of the bowel, it can die. Doctors call this a
strangulated hernia. It's very serious and you'll need to have an operation to repair the hernia straight
away.

Untreated strangulated hernias can cause death. About 5 in 100 people need emergency
surgery for a first hernia.

To repair a hernia that has come back
Hernia surgery works well for most people, but it is not uncommon for hernias to come
back and for people to need a second operation.

Does every hernia need surgery?
Doctors usually suggest that people with a hernia should have it repaired. But if
your hernia is small and you don't have any other symptoms (such as pain or redness),
you might not need it repaired straight away. You can wait until it's convenient.


Some people can push the hernia back in, but it's likely to come out again. Babies
and children tend to have hernias fixed straight away, because hernias in children
are more likely to become strangulated.

If you are older and have another serious illness, such as heart problems or breathing
problems, talk to your doctor about whether it’s best to have hernia surgery or to
leave it alone.

What will happen?
The operation takes between 30 and 50 minutes. You might be able to go home the same
day, but some people stay in hospital overnight.

Before the operation you'll need to go to the toilet to empty your bladder. A full
bladder is more likely to be damaged during the operation or to block the surgeon's
view of your hernia.

There are two ways to do this operation:


With open surgery the surgeon opens up your groin so that he or she can see inside



With keyhole surgery the surgeon uses a tiny camera to see inside your groin, so a large cut is not needed.



Open surgery
Open hernia surgery can be done with either a general or local anaesthetic.
With a general anaesthetic you'll be asleep during the operation. With a local anaesthetic
in the groin or an epidural (a pain-killing injection into the spine) you’ll be awake
but you won’t feel any pain.

You'll need to have the hair in your groin area shaved off.
During the operation:


your surgeon makes a cut through your groin. The cut will be about 5 to 10 centimetres
long (about 2 inches to 4 inches)



the bowel and fat are pushed back into place


the surgeon usually covers the hole in the muscle with a patch of mesh. This strengthens
the muscle to stop your bowel slipping through again. You'll probably need stitches
to close the wound. These will eventually dissolve.



Keyhole surgery
During this type of hernia surgery:


you'll have a general anaesthetic to make you sleep. The surgeon makes a small cut
in, or just below, your belly button.



a thin tube with a light and camera on the end (called a laparoscope) is put through
the cut and down to your groin. The camera sends pictures to a screen so the surgeon
can see inside your abdomen.



instruments to repair the hernia are inserted through another small cut lower down
your abdomen. Your surgeon pushes the section of bowel in the hernia back into your
abdomen and closes the hole with a mesh patch.



Which type of surgery is best?
You might be able to choose what type of surgery you have. Often, the type of surgery
you are offered will depend on what is usually used where you are being treated.

For example, it might be that your surgeon has a lot of experience with one technique.
You should ask your doctor about what type of surgery you will have and why.

There are advantages to each type of surgery. Some doctors recommend keyhole surgery
for several reasons. For example:



your scars will be smaller. Keyhole operations leave two small scars near your belly button. Each scar is about 1 centimetre (half
an inch) long. If you have open surgery you'll have a scar in your groin that's about 5 to 10 centimetres (2 to 4 inches)
long



you might be able to leave hospital a few hours sooner than if you have open surgery


you'll probably recover faster. People who have a keyhole operation can usually get
back to their normal daily activities a few days sooner than people who have open
surgery



you might have less pain and numbness in the days after your surgery, so you won't
need to take as many painkillers



you are less likely to have pain that drags on for months or even years after the
hernia has been repaired (doctors call this chronic groin pain).



But one downside of keyhole surgery is that you will need a general anaesthetic, while
open surgery can be done with a local anaesthetic. A local anaesthetic is less likely
to cause problems such as nausea and, rarely, allergic reactions.

Serious problems, such as damage to other organs, are rare. But they might be more
likely to happen with keyhole surgery.

What are the risks?
All operations have risks, and your surgeon should discuss them with you before you
have your hernia repaired.

Anaesthetics can have side effects. These are more common with general anaesthetics. The most
common side effect is feeling nauseous for a while after you wake up.

Anaesthetics can also cause allergic reactions in some people. You should tell your
doctor before your operation if you have any allergies.

The list of possible complications below might look long and worrying. But remember,
these are just things that might happen, not that definitely will. Most people have
no problems with hernia surgery.

You are more likely to have problems during or after hernia surgery if you smoke or
if you are very overweight.

Problems that can happen in the short term
Complications that can happen during or soon after the operation include:


heavy bleeding under the skin after the operation. If the blood builds up and clots,
your groin will swell and feel tender. This causes a large bruise called a haematoma. Haematomas often go away by themselves. But if the bleeding doesn't stop you might
need an operation to stop it



a temporary build-up of fluid in the groin area. Doctors call this a seroma


an infection deep inside your groin or in the wound on your skin. This is very rare.
But if it happens you will need antibiotics to treat it



injured blood vessels and organs. This is more common with keyhole surgery. In men,
it's possible to damage the tube (called the vas deferens) that carries sperm from
each testicle to the penis. If this happens, you might not be able to produce sperm



switching to an open operation. Your surgeon might start the operation using the keyhole
method but then might need to cut open your groin part way through



temporary swelling in the testicles. It's common for men to have slightly swollen
testicles for a few days after the operation. But in some men, the testicles become
very large and painful. This is called testicular atrophy. It happens if the blood supply to the scrotum or testicles is cut off during the
operation.



Possible longer-term problems
Problems that can last a long time or that can start some time after your operation
include:



long-lasting groin pain. This is a common complication of this kind of surgery. It
happens to about 10 in 100 people. Some people have pain that drags on for months
or even years. This is called chronic groin pain. This probably happens when nerves get trapped in the stitches or mesh or become
damaged during the operation.

People describe it as a stabbing, gnawing, and tugging pain in their groin and upper
thigh. It can be bad enough to affect people’s quality of life. For example, it can
affect your mood and your relationships. In some people it’s so serious that it affects
their sleep and their ability to walk.

Chronic groin pain seems to be more common in people who were in a lot of pain before
their operation, and it seems to happen more often with open surgery than with keyhole
surgery



numbness in your groin. If nerves are damaged during the operation your groin area
might go numb. The feeling might return, but in some people it takes months or even
years. This problem is more common after open surgery



your hernia coming back. This affects about 2 in 100 people. Your hernia might be
more likely to come back if you smoke, because smoking affects the healing process.



What can I expect afterwards?
Straight after the operation: a nurse will take your temperature, pulse, and blood pressure regularly. You might
feel a little nauseous from the anaesthetic. But you should be able to get up and
eat and drink normally within a few hours.

Your groin will feel sore and uncomfortable for a while after your operation. But
you'll be given painkillers. If you’re still in pain, you should tell your nurse.
Being in pain can slow your recovery. You might need a higher dose or a different
painkiller.

If the pain is severe or lasts longer than a week, you should see your doctor, as
you could have an infection or a trapped nerve.

People who have keyhole surgery tend to have less pain than those who have open surgery.
At home: taking gentle exercise when you get home can help healing, but you should avoid doing
sport or heavy lifting for a while.

Drink plenty of water and eat foods that are high in fibre (such as wholemeal bread
and green vegetables) to prevent constipation. Straining to empty your bowels can
put pressure on your abdomen.

If you had open surgery, the dressing stays in place for two to five days. Most dressings
are waterproof, but check this with your surgeon or a nurse before you take a shower
or bath.

You'll have scars either in your groin or on your abdomen, but the redness should
fade.

Back to work. It will take two to three weeks before you can get back to your usual activities,
such as walking, working, and sport. But you might recover faster if you've had a
keyhole operation.

People with physically demanding jobs take about four weeks off, while people who
work sitting down tend to take less than two weeks off.

Sex. You might find sex painful or uncomfortable at first, but it's fine to have sex
as soon as you feel ready.

Driving. It's best not to drive for the first few days while your groin is healing. This
is because you might not be able to brake suddenly if you need to, and the impact
of stopping might hurt and could cause the hernia to come back."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1232121552247/Impetigo,Impetigo,"Impetigo Last published: Sep 11, 2020
Impetigo is a common skin infection that is easily spread from person to person. It
can be annoying, but with the right treatment it usually clears up quickly.

You can use our information to talk to your doctor and decide which treatments are
best for you or your child.

What is impetigo?
Impetigo is a skin infection, usually caused by bacteria called Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes. In Europe, Staphylococcus aureus is the most common cause. You might also hear this called 'golden staph'.
Impetigo spreads easily from person to person. You’re more likely to catch it if you
have broken skin - for example, from a graze or an insect bite. It tends to happen
on the face, often around the nose or mouth. Impetigo is more common in children than
in adults, but it can affect people of any age.

There are two types of impetigo. The most common is called crusted or non-bullous
impetigo. It starts as small blisters, which quickly burst and crust over. The other
type, called bullous impetigo, causes large blisters that break easily. It’s less
common, and mainly affects babies.

What are the symptoms?
The most obvious symptom of impetigo is the crust that forms when the blisters burst.
It’s a golden, dark-yellow colour and sticks to the skin. Some people say it looks
a bit like cornflakes stuck to the skin.

The patches can sometimes be sore or itchy, but most people don't get these symptoms.
Doctors can usually diagnose impetigo just by looking at your skin.

But doctors sometimes test what type of bacteria is causing the problem. This is done
by rubbing a cotton swab over a patch of impetigo to collect a sample and then sending
it to a laboratory for testing.

What treatments work?
It's important to clean the affected skin twice daily with soap and water or an antibacterial
cleanser, such as chlorhexidine. This will reduce the amount of bacteria on the skin.
However, chlorhexidine isn't recommended for babies or young children.

The usual treatment for impetigo is a cream or ointment containing an antibiotic.
This works for most people. These antibiotic creams require a prescription from your
doctor.

If antibiotic creams or ointments haven’t worked, or if you have a more severe infection,
your doctor may prescribe antibiotic tablets instead. You will probably take the antibiotics
for seven days.

If antibiotic tablets don’t help, your doctor may do a swab test to find out what
type of bacteria is causing the infection. This is because some antibiotics work better
for certain infections.

If the infection spreads deep in your skin or to your blood, you will be treated in
hospital with antibiotics given through a drip (an intravenous infusion or IV). This
doesn't happen to most people.

Newborn babies and people with a weak immune system are usually treated with oral
antibiotics (such as tablets or syrups) or an antibiotic drip instead of an antibiotic
cream or ointment. This is because the infection is more likely to spread and lead
to serious problems for these people.

Things you can do to stop the infection spreading
Because impetigo spreads so easily, it’s important to try to avoid passing it on to
other people. The best way to stop impetigo spreading is to be careful about washing
and drying your hands.

You should wash your hands with soap whenever you’ve touched an area of impetigo (for
example, when putting on antibiotic cream). Keeping your nails short can also help.

Parents are often advised to keep their children home from school or playgroups until
they’ve been treated for impetigo. But advice about this varies.

At home, try to keep the towels, facecloths, and bed linen of anyone with impetigo
separate from those of people who haven't been infected.

What will happen to me?
Without treatment, impetigo usually goes away within a few weeks. But most people
are advised to have treatment, because it spreads so easily.

Treatments usually work within a few days. But impetigo may come back. If it comes
back regularly, you might be carrying the Staphylococcus aureus bacteria in your nose. Your doctor can do a swab test to check. You can use an antibiotic
cream inside your nose to get rid of it."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/3000195/Hysterectomy,Hysterectomy,"Hysterectomy Last published: Sep 14, 2022
A hysterectomy is an operation to remove the uterus (womb). Having a hysterectomy
can help to treat or cure several conditions, including heavy periods, fibroids, and
some cancers.

Here, we look at how and why it’s done, and what the risks might be. You can use our
information to talk with your doctor about how this operation might help you, and
to ask any questions that you have.

What is a hysterectomy?
There are several types of hysterectomy:


With a total hysterectomy the uterus is removed along with the cervix. The cervix is the neck of the womb.
It sits between the uterus and the vagina.



With a subtotal hysterectomy just the uterus is removed.



Some women have other tissue and organs removed during a hysterectomy, depending on
their medical needs. For example, some women need to have the ovaries and fallopian
tubes removed, along with other nearby tissue.

These other tissues are often removed as part of an operation to remove a cancer.
But your doctor might suggest removing them even if you don’t have cancer, because
it can help prevent cancer and cysts from developing in the future.

Why might I need a hysterectomy?
A hysterectomy can be used to treat several conditions, including:


heavy periods. After a hysterectomy you won’t have periods any more. So you won’t have any more
symptoms linked to heavy periods, such as cramps, backache, and bloating



fibroids (lumps in the womb). If you have fibroids, these will be removed during a hysterectomy.
So you won’t have any more of the problems that fibroids can cause (such as pain or
heavy periods), and the fibroids won’t come back



cancer. Several types of cancer, including endometrial cancer (cancer of the womb) and cervical
cancer can be treated with a hysterectomy. If the cancer is at an early stage, this
treatment can often cure it completely



endometriosis. This happens when small pieces of your womb lining stick to other parts of your
body, such as your ovaries or your bladder. Your doctor might suggest hysterectomy
if other treatments haven’t worked



pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) can cause severe pelvic pain. Pain that doesn’t get better with other treatment can
be treated with a hysterectomy



a prolapsed womb. This happens when the muscles and other tissues called ligaments, which support
the womb, get weaker, causing the womb to drop.



Rarely, an emergency hysterectomy is needed. This happens when a woman has severe bleeding after giving birth. The
hysterectomy is done as a last resort to stop the bleeding and save the mother’s life.

Will I feel better?
For treatments other than cancer, hysterectomy is not life saving. But it can help
you feel better and more able to live life normally and with less pain.

It’s not possible to predict what will happen to individual women. And hysterectomy
isn’t a miracle cure. But it can help many women to feel better about themselves,
have less pain, and feel more able to enjoy the normal activities of life, such as
work, being active, family time, and socialising.

What will happen?
A hysterectomy can be done in several ways.


With abdominal surgery, the surgeon removes the womb by making a cut low down on your abdomen (tummy).



With keyhole surgery (also called laparoscopy), the womb is removed through several small cuts in the
abdomen.



The womb can also sometimes be removed through the vagina, so that there is no need for any cuts in the abdomen.



Whatever type of surgery you have, you might have an assessment appointment a few
days before the operation. At this appointment your doctor might ask you about your
general health, how you are feeling, and whether you have any questions.

Abdominal surgery
This operation is done under general anaesthetic. The surgeon makes a horizontal (sideways)
cut low on the abdomen, just above your pubic hair. If your womb is very large, or
if you have a large fibroid, the surgeon might make a vertical cut.

The womb (and any other tissues that need to be removed) are taken out through the
incision. The incision is then sewn up. The operation often takes less than an hour.

Keyhole surgery
This operation takes a little longer than abdominal surgery. It’s usually done under
general anaesthetic.

The surgeon makes a small cut in the abdomen and then feeds a tiny camera into the
incision. He or she can then see inside your womb without making a larger cut.

Your uterus, and any other tissue that needs to be removed, can then be taken out
through other small incisions in the abdomen, or through your vagina.

Vaginal hysterectomy
Like keyhole surgery, this operation can sometimes be done with a local anaesthetic.
The surgeon doesn’t usually need to make any cuts in your abdomen. He or she inserts
the surgical instruments through the vagina, and removes the womb by the same route.

What are the risks?
As with any surgery, having a hysterectomy carries some risks. Some of these are minor
problems while others are more serious.

Minor problems that can happen include:


problems with anaesthetics. Anaesthetics can make you feel nauseous. And some people
are allergic to them. But you will be carefully monitored for problems



unusually heavy bleeding during the operation. This is more common with abdominal
surgery



infection. If this happens you will need treatment with antibiotics


bruising. This can look worrying but it’s not serious and will go away after a while.


More serious problems are rare, but they can happen. They include:


damage to the bowel or bladder during the operation. If this happens you might need
another operation to repair the damage



needing to change to abdominal surgery once your operation has started. Your surgeon
might start by doing a vaginal hysterectomy. But an abdominal cut might be needed
if he or she cannot remove your womb through your vagina



blood clots forming in your legs. If these clots break away they can travel to your
lungs and stop you breathing properly. This is rare, but it’s serious when it happens.
You might be given special support stockings to wear after your operation to improve
your blood flow and help prevent clots



dying during the operation. This is very rare. But your doctor should discuss this
and all the risks with you.



Some problems happen some time after the surgery. They include:


symptoms of the menopause. This often happens to women who have their ovaries and
fallopian tubes removed. These symptoms include a dry vagina and hot flushes. Some
women decide to take HRT if this happens



vaginal prolapse. This means that the vagina can no longer be supported by the muscles
around it, and other organs can push it out of shape, causing discomfort. If this
happens you might need an operation to correct it



bladder problems. Having a hysterectomy can increase your chance of being incontinent
in later life. This means that you might need to urinate more often, often without
much warning, or leak urine.



What can I expect afterwards?
Recovery in hospital
If you’ve had a general anaesthetic, you might feel tired and sore when you wake up.
You will be given painkillers, probably through an intravenous (IV) drip in your hand.

Whichever type of operation you have had, you might also need:


a catheter fitted to remove urine, and




a tube in place to remove any fluid from your abdomen.


These tubes usually only stay in for a day or so. You’ll be encouraged to eat and
drink normally when you feel like it, and to get up and move around.

You might get some watery, blood-stained discharge from your vagina for a few days
after the operation. This will gradually clear up.

Recovery at home
When you can go home depends on several things, including:


what type of operation you had


your general health, and


your age.


If you had abdominal surgery you will need to recover in hospital for about four days.
With the other types of operation you can usually go home a day or two earlier.

Once you're home, it's important to take it easy for a few days. But you should try
to do some gentle walking each day. Don't lift anything too heavy (no heavier than
a full kettle) for the first six weeks, as your body needs time to heal.

You might feel low or tearful for a few days after your operation and your moods might
change. This is normal. Your body has been under quite a lot of stress and these feelings
are natural.

If you are in pain, paracetamol or ibuprofen can help. But don’t take more than the
recommended dose.

You might need a couple of months to recover and get back to normal. But if you've
had your womb removed through your vagina, your recovery will be quicker.

When you can get back to work depends partly on the kind of work you do. But it will
be at least a few weeks.

And it will be between a few weeks and a couple of months before you can start driving
again. As a guide, you're probably OK to drive when you feel you could make an emergency
stop without thinking about whether it might hurt.

The longer term
The way that women feel about themselves, their bodies, and their wellbeing after
a hysterectomy varies a lot.

For example, if you had a hysterectomy to remove cancer, you might think of it as
something that was just necessary to cure you. Any other feelings about it might come
second.

But if you had a hysterectomy for another reason - for example, heavy periods - your
feelings might be more complex. After all, it’s a big physical change that can affect
your emotions and take time to come to terms with.

For example, you might worry that having your womb removed will make you feel less
feminine or affect your sex life. And it’s true that after a hysterectomy some women
find that they have difficulty becoming aroused, and have a lower sex drive.

But it can work the other way, too. Many women feel much better about themselves after
their hysterectomy than they have done for months or years. For example, they have
fewer problems with depression and anxiety, and their sex life improves.

It takes time for your body to settle down, though. For example, it's best to wait
until about four to six weeks after the operation before you have sex. By this time,
your discharge will have stopped and your vagina should have healed. You won't need
to use contraception because you don't have a womb anymore.

If sex is uncomfortable it might be because your vagina is dry. This is more likely
to happen if your ovaries were removed during your hysterectomy. You can use a vaginal
lubricant, which you can buy at a pharmacy. Or you might want to talk to your doctor
about hormone replacement therapy (HRT).

There might be other changes, too. For example, if you've had a total hysterectomy
your cervix will have been removed, so you won’t ever need to have cervical cancer
screening again (what used to be called a 'smear test' or 'PAP smear').

You might find it helpful to talk to your partner, or to friends or family about how
you feel after your operation. Emotional support can be helpful in helping you to
recover, adjust, and hopefully feel better."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/3000300/Hyponatraemia,Hyponatraemia,"Hyponatraemia Last published: Jan 18, 2023
​Hyponatraemia happens when you don’t have enough of a mineral called sodium in your
blood. It is common in people being treated in hospital. You may have heard it called
'low blood sodium'.

If not treated, hyponatraemia can cause serious problems, including swelling in the
brain, and even death. If you think that you or someone you are with has symptoms
of low blood sodium, seek medical help straight away.

What is hyponatraemia?
Hyponatraemia means that you don’t have enough of a mineral called sodium in your blood. It can be caused by having too much water in your body, but also by
having too little (being dehydrated).

Hyponatraemia is very common in people treated in hospital, especially older people.
Treating hyponatraemia is fairly simple. But leaving it untreated can cause serious
problems.

Why is sodium important?
Sodium helps to control how water flows through the cells in your body. If you don’t
have enough sodium, too much water can flow into certain parts of your body, especially
the brain. This can cause the brain to swell.

This swelling in the brain (also called cerebral oedema) is more likely to happen when hyponatraemia comes on quickly. If this happens it
is a medical emergency that needs immediate treatment.

There are several kinds of hyponatraemia. For example:


Hypertonic hyponatraemia means that you have enough sodium in your body, but it’s mainly in
your cells and not in your blood, while



Hypotonic hyponatraemia happens when you don’t have enough sodium. This is the most common
type of hyponatraemia, and the type we look at here.



What causes hyponatraemia?
Low blood sodium can be caused either by having too much water in your body or too
little.

Several things can cause you to have too much water in your blood. They include:



Kidney problems


Congestive heart failure


A liver problem called cirrhosis, and


Drinking a very large amount of water. This can happen after someone has done a lot
of strenuous exercise: for example, during military training or after taking part
in a marathon. It can also happen to people with a condition called polydipsia, where they feel a powerful urge to drink a lot of water.



Things that can cause too little water in your blood (dehydration) include:



Severe diarrhoea or vomiting


A kidney condition called nephropathy


A history of head injuries that means that you don’t have enough sodium in your brain.
This is called cerebral salt wasting, and



Conditions that cause something called third spacing of fluids, where fluids settle in the spaces between cells in your body, rather than in the
cells themselves. Pancreatitis is one condition that can cause this to happen.



Some medicines and some recreational ('street') drugs can cause low blood sodium. These include:



Drugs called vasopressors, which are used to treat conditions such as diabetes insipidus,
where the body loses water too quickly



Opioid painkillers and some antidepressants


Some non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (drugs that treat swelling and the pain
it causes)



Some drugs used to treat epilepsy


Some drugs used to treat psychosis (seeing and hearing things that aren’t real)


Methylenedioxy-methamfetamine (MDMA or ecstasy), and


Some laxatives that you take before a colonoscopy (when a camera is inserted into the anus so your doctor can look for bowel problems).



What are the symptoms?
Symptoms of hyponatraemia can include:


Changes in someone’s personality


Feeling tired and slow, and


Confusion.


Cerebral oedema (swelling in the brain) is more likely when hyponatraemia develops quickly (usually within 24 hours).

People with cerebral oedema usually have more severe symptoms, which can include:


Nausea and vomiting


Drowsiness


Seizures, and


Coma.


If your doctor thinks that you may have hyponatraemia, they will probably ask you
questions about your symptoms. For example, they may ask you about:



How much water or other fluids you have drunk recently


Whether you have had any stomach problems, such as diarrhoea or vomiting


If you suffer from kidney problems


What medicines, if any, you are taking


Whether you use recreational drugs


Whether you have thyroid or other hormone problems.


Your doctor will also want to do blood and urine tests, and possibly scans.
What treatments are available?
The simplest way to treat low blood sodium is with salt water (saline) given directly into a vein. Salt contains a lot of sodium (the chemical name for
salt is sodium chloride).

How much saline you will need, and how quickly, will depend on how severe your symptoms
are.

Your doctor will want to be careful not to give you too much. Giving someone too much
saline can cause serious problems with the nervous system. So your doctor should monitor
you closely.

Some people with severe symptoms may also be given oxygen, and medicines to control seizures.

You may need to stay in hospital for a while and have your sodium levels tested every
few hours, or every day. Many people with hyponatraemia are already being treated
in hospital for other conditions.

If your hyponatraemia has been caused by another condition, such as heart failure
or kidney problems, your doctor may discuss with you how this should be treated.

What to expect in the future
Hyponatraemia is common in people who are being treated in hospital for a variety
of reasons, and it’s often hard to avoid. But the staff treating you should be aware
of it, and should know what to look out for.

But there are things that some people can do to help prevent it. For example, if you
are taking certain medicines, such as some antidepressants, you should avoid drinking
excessive amounts of water or other fluids.

This also applies if you have certain medical conditions, including heart failure,
cirrhosis, and kidney problems. If you are not sure about what is a safe amount of
fluid to drink for your condition, ask your doctor."

Huntington’s disease is an inherited condition that affects the nervous system. It
causes problems with movement, memory, and concentration.

There are treatments that can help with some of the symptoms, but there is no cure.
Huntington’s slowly gets worse over a number of years and eventually leads to death.

If you are affected by Huntington’s, you can use our information to talk to your doctor
about the treatments available and planning for the future.

What is Huntington’s disease?
If you've got Huntington’s disease, a part of your brain stops working properly. This
affects the nervous system, causing problems with movement, memory, speech, and concentration.

Huntington’s is an inherited condition. About half of people with a parent with Huntington’s will go on to develop
it. It is not infectious. You can’t catch Huntington’s from someone else or pass it
on like a virus or a bacterial infection.

Symptoms can start at any age, but it’s usually between the ages of 30 and 50.
There is no cure for Huntington’s. The symptoms slowly get worse over time, and most
people die from it about 20 years after they first have symptoms.

Men and women are equally likely to get it. But it’s much more common in people of
white, northern European descent than in people of most other ethnic groups.

What are the symptoms?
The symptoms of Huntington’s affect people in three main ways. These are:


Thinking and memory: the medical term is cognitive impairment


Changes in behaviour, and



Problems with movement. Doctors call these motor symptoms.



Cognitive impairment symptoms
Symptoms that affect thinking and memory are often some of the earliest symptoms of
Huntington’s. They include:



Problems with concentration. For example, you may notice that your work is suffering


Anxiety about work, and not caring about your work as much as you used to


Needing help from family or friends with things that you used to be in charge of,
and



Making poor decisions when you need to concentrate. For example, you may be more likely
to have a car accident.



Behaviour symptoms
Huntington’s can affect someone’s behaviour in many ways, including:


Being irritable


Being impulsive. For example, you may make quick decisions without thinking much about
them



Not paying attention to how you look, or to personal hygiene


Personality changes. For example, someone’s friends and relatives may notice changes
in their habits and interests.



Problems with movement (motor symptoms)
Huntington’s affects the nerves and the muscles that they control. This can lead to
symptoms including:



Twitching and jerking movements that you can’t control. Doctors call this chorea


Seeming restless and unable to stop moving


Problems with coordination


Moving slowly. For example, walking more slowly than you used to, and stiff muscles
that don’t relax.



People with Huntington’s often develop depression. It’s not clear whether this is a symptom of the changes in the brain that Huntington’s
causes, or whether it’s a reaction to having the condition.

If you see your doctor with symptoms similar to those of Huntington’s, your doctor
will ask you if you know whether either of your parents had the condition.

It may be possible to have genetic testing to find out if you have inherited Huntington’s. But other tests and scans are not
always needed, especially at first.

Being diagnosed with Huntington’s can be hard to deal with. You may want time to think
about it before making any treatment decisions.

And you may want to think about having counselling to help you cope. Your doctor may
be able to help in arranging this.

What treatments are available?
Unfortunately there is no cure for Huntington’s. And, while there are treatments that
can help with some of the symptoms, there are none for the condition itself.

But this is likely to change as we find out more about the condition. For example,
there is currently a lot of research into how to stop the Huntington’s gene from causing
problems. These treatments are some years away, but they should offer hope for the
future.

The medicines currently used to help people with Huntington’s can have side effects in some people. Your doctor should talk to you about them, and about what to do if
they happen.

For example, you may be able to switch to a different medicine or dose. But don’t
just put up with them.

Depression
Depression and anxiety are common in people with Huntington’s. But treatments such as medicines and counselling
can help.

Counselling for depression linked to Huntington’s is different from counselling for
depression from other causes. It focuses on issues that concern the person and their
carers. For example, you may learn about:



How Huntington’s can affect your behaviour and your thoughts, and


What you can reasonably expect from yourself, and how your carers can help.


Obsessive-compulsive behaviours
Many people with Huntington’s develop some types of obsessive-compulsive behaviours.
For example, they may want to stick to rigid routines or to wash their hands a lot.

Some people develop new interests that they become obsessed with and anxious about.
Of course, there’s nothing wrong with having routines or new interests. But if these
cause anxiety and other problems, there are medicines that can help someone to relax and be less obsessive.

You can talk to your doctor about whether medicines like these would be suitable for
you.

A talking treatment called cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) can also help people to understand the changes in their behaviour and deal with them.


Behaviour and mood problems
Problems with behaviour and mood can get worse as Huntington’s gets worse over time.
For example, some people have problems with:



Being irritable


Mood swings


Aggression, and


Outbursts of bad temper. Some people with Huntington’s sometimes become physically
and verbally abusive.



Several types of medicine have been found to help with these symptoms, including:


Antidepressants


Mood stabilisers, and


Antipsychotics.


Antipsychotic medicines may sound like an alarming treatment. But these medicines are often used
to treat conditions other than psychosis. For example, they often just help people
to feel calmer and less anxious.

These medicines aren’t suitable for everyone. For example, some people find that they
make their mood worse. So it may take a while to find out which medicines are most
suitable for an individual.

Problems with movement
Symptoms such as twitching and jerking can be difficult to treat, partly because the
medicines that can help can make some of the other symptoms of Huntington’s worse.
For example, they can affect your mood, concentration, and coordination.

So it can take time to find something that helps you without causing other problems.
Physiotherapy can help with some of these problems. Your doctor may be able to help you find a
suitable therapist.

Pregnancy and medicines
Medicines called valproates are sometimes used to help with some of the symptoms of Huntington’s.

If you are a woman or girl of childbearing age, you should not become pregnant while taking medicines that contain valproates. Valproates cause severe birth defects.

If you need to take these medicines, your doctor should discuss them with you carefully
and help you to make a pregnancy-prevention plan.

What to expect in the future
If you have relatives with Huntington’s, you can have a blood test to tell whether
you have the Huntington's gene. You don’t have to have the test, and many people prefer
not to.

If you decide to have the test, your doctor may first refer you to a genetic counsellor, who can discuss with you the pros and cons of having the test.

While many symptoms of Huntington’s, such as depression and mood changes, can be helped
with medicine and therapy, the condition is not curable and it is eventually fatal.

Most people live for about 20 years after diagnosis, but the symptoms will get worse
over time. This means that it’s a good idea to try to look ahead and plan as well
as you can.

For example, you may be able to keep doing things like working, driving, and cooking
for yourself for years. But it’s a good idea to think about putting plans in place
for when you can’t.

But there’s no need to rush most decisions. Huntington’s usually gets worse slowly,
over a number of years. There is usually time to take in the news of your diagnosis
and immediate treatment needs before dealing with the stress of making longer-term
plans.

After your diagnosis, your doctor will probably want to check on you every three to
six months. But you should see them more often if you feel you need to.

When you see your doctor they will check on what things you are still able to do for
yourself, for example, how you are coping with work, and whether your treatments are
helping.

They will also want to check on your mental health. Depression is a common problem in people with Huntington’s, and your doctor will
want to do whatever is possible to help.

Over time, long-term complications of Huntington’s get noticeably worse. For example, most people lose weight, have
trouble swallowing, and struggle to do many things for themselves.

Support for carers
People with Huntington’s will need a lot of care at some point. Caring for someone
with the condition can be difficult and demanding.

Support for carers of people with Huntington’s should be a part of the care someone
receives, and your doctor should be aware of this each time they see you.

Support groups can offer many kinds of help, including practical information about
financial and community support.

For example, in the UK, the Huntington’s Disease Associatio (hda.org.uk) is a vital resource for many people. The International Huntington Association (huntington-disease.org) is another well-known organisation that helps many people.
Your doctor may be able to help you find support in your area, or you can search online."

The HPV vaccine is designed to protect against the human papillomavirus (HPV).
HPV is the main cause of cervical cancer, which kills many thousands of women each
year.

What is human papillomavirus?
HPV is probably most commonly known as the virus that causes warts, including genital warts.

But HPV is usually harmless and causes no symptoms at all.
Most people who are not vaccinated will be infected with HPV at some point during
their lives, usually with no ill effects, as the body’s immune system fights off the
infection.

HPV and cervical cancer
In some people, the immune system doesn’t manage to fight off the infection. If this
happens, it can cause serious health problems. For example, HPV is the main cause
of cervical cancer.

In 2020 about 850 women in the UK died of cervical cancer. In the US the number was
more than 4,000.

Cervical cancer affects the cervix, which is the lower part of the uterus (womb). It sits between the lower part of
the uterus and the vagina.

Women who are diagnosed with early-stage cervical cancer can usually be cured with
surgery. But most women diagnosed with late-stage cervical cancer will not survive.

HPV can also cause other types of cancer, including cancers that affect the vulva,
vagina, penis, anus, and the mouth and throat (called oropharyngeal cancer).

Who needs the HPV vaccination?
Young people
HPV spreads easily through unprotected sex. It is the most common sexually transmitted
infection (STI).

But it can also spread through other kinds of intimate touching, without actually
having sex. For example, the virus is commonly present on the hands, in the mouth,
and around the genitals.

For example, in the UK, boys and girls are offered the vaccine when they are around
12 and 13 years old.

The vaccine is given in two doses. The second dose is given between six months and two years after the first dose.
It’s important to have both doses for the best protection.

Catch-up vaccines
Young people who missed out on the vaccine programme at school might still be able
to have the vaccine, depending on where you live.

For example, in the UK, you can still have the vaccine up to the age of 25 years.
So if you (or your child) missed out on the vaccine for any reason, or just missed
one of the doses, talk to your doctor about getting the vaccine.

Men who have sex with men
Men who have sex with men (or MSM for short) might be able to get the vaccine over
the age of 25, depending on where you live. For example, in the UK, this group is
offered the vaccine up to the age of 45 years.

Transgender people
Some transgender people might have an increased chance of HPV infection. So, depending
on where you live, you might be able to get the HPV vaccine.

For example, in the UK, many transgender people can have the vaccine up to the age
of 45 years. If you are a trans person and you think you might benefit from the HPV
vaccine, talk to your doctor.

Is there anyone who shouldn’t have the vaccine?
It’s very rare, but some people have a severe allergic reaction to the vaccine. You
shouldn’t have this vaccine if you are allergic to any of its ingredients. Tell your
doctor or the medical staff giving the vaccine about any allergies you have.

For example, you shouldn’t have the second dose of the vaccine if you had an allergic
reaction to the first dose.

The staff giving the vaccine will have been trained in how to treat a severe allergic
reaction.

Is it safe?
The HPV vaccine is fairly new compared to some vaccines that have been used for many
years, such as the tetanus vaccine. But many millions of people have now been vaccinated,
and no major safety issues have been found.

Like all vaccines, the HPV vaccine can cause side effects in some people. These are
usually mild and short term. They include:



redness, swelling, and pain where the injection was given (called the injection site)


a headache


fever


nausea


pain in the arms or legs, and


a rash.


Some people also have breathing problems after this vaccine, but this is extremely
rare.

How is the vaccination given?
The HPV vaccine is given as an injection into the upper arm. The second dose is given
between six months and two years after the first. It’s important to get both doses
for the best protection.

How well does the vaccine work?
The HPV vaccine is fairly new compared with some vaccines, so we don’t have as much
information about how well it works as we do for other vaccines.

For example, the cancers caused by HPV can take many years to develop, so it will
be some years before we have a clear picture of how many cancers have been prevented.

But studies suggest that there has already been a large fall in the number of dangerous
infections, and in cervical problems in women who have been vaccinated.

The vaccine only seems to offer protection against HPV for about ten years. This means
that it’s important for women to keep up with their cervical cancer screening (PAP
smear) appointments.

To find out more about screening, see our leaflet on Cervical cancer."

Taking certain steps might lower your child’s chance of ear infections. There hasn't
been enough research to show for certain that these things work, but they might be
worth trying.



Don't smoke near your child, and make sure no one else does either. Exposing your
child's ears to cigarette smoke may increase the chance of ear infections.



Try to keep your child away from other children who have colds or other infections
whenever possible.



Make sure your child washes hands frequently, particularly before eating.


If you're pregnant or you've just had a baby, consider breastfeeding your newborn,
even for just a few months. Breastfeeding rather than bottle-feeding seems to lower
a child’s chance of ear infections in the years to come.



If you bottle-feed, try not to let your child use a bottle lying down. Babies who
drink from a bottle lying down seem to get ear infections more often.



If your child has an allergy, try to remove the thing that triggers an allergic reaction,
such as animal hair. Some research has shown that allergies are linked to ear infections.
(An allergy happens when the body's immune system overreacts to a substance that's
usually harmless, such as pollen.)



Make sure your child’s immunisations are up to date.


It's not clear from the research whether sucking a dummy can increase the chance of
ear infections. There might be a risk for children who are prone to these infections.
If your child gets lots of ear infections and is over 1 year old, it might be worth
trying to wean your child off his or her dummy."

There are a lot of things you can do to reduce your chances of getting a fungal infection
in your nails or on your skin. The itchy, flaky skin that people get on their toes
when they have athlete's foot is also caused by a fungus.

Keeping your feet and hands clean and dry is your best protection. But there are several
other things you can also do.

Tips for avoiding infections
Your shoes and socks


Take off your shoes when you're at home, and let air get to your feet. If your shoes
get sweaty, let them dry out before wearing them again.



Wear sandals to let the air get to your toes (if you have diabetes, you may need to
wear special sandals - talk to your doctor). Or wear shoes made from leather or canvas.
These natural materials let your feet breathe more than materials that are man-made.




Don't spend any more time than you need to in sweaty sports shoes.


Try to find shoes that don't have any seams on the inside near your toes, so they
don't damage your toenails.



Make sure your shoes fit well. If your shoes are too short, they can damage your toenails
by rubbing against them. If they are too long, they can damage your nails because
your foot moves around too much inside the shoe. You should also make sure your shoes
aren’t too tight.



Don't borrow other people's shoes.


Wear socks that absorb sweat. Fabrics that wick away moisture include wool, nylon,
and polypropylene.



Change your socks every day, especially when it's warm. Washing your socks kills the
fungus that causes nail infections.



In public places


Dry your feet well, especially after using communal changing areas. Make sure the
skin between your toes is dry.



Don't walk barefoot in public areas (for example, around gyms). Wear flip-flops or
sandals.



Don't borrow other people's towels.


Tips for keeping your nails healthy


Keep your toenails short and trim them straight across.


File down any thick areas.


Never use the same scissors, files, or nail clippers on infected and uninfected nails.
If you do, the infection may spread.



Don't pick at the skin around your nails. This can give the infection an easy way
in.



If you get a manicure or pedicure, make sure you go to a reputable nail salon that
sterilises its instruments between customers.



If you do get an infection


Get it treated. This will stop the infection spreading to other nails. And use an
antifungal powder in your shoes.



Don't use nail polish or artificial nails. This can trap moisture and make your infection
worse.



If you have athlete's foot, get it treated and check everyone in your family. Make
sure they are treated if they have it. The fungus that causes athlete's foot can spread
to your nails. If you've had athlete's foot, spray the inside of your shoes with an
antifungal spray so you don't catch it again."

You should see your doctor if any of the following is true:


Your child is waking up at night more than usual with asthma symptoms


The inhaler you use to treat your child's symptoms quickly (the reliever) doesn't
help their breathing for very long, or doesn't help at all, or you are using it more
often



Your child can’t breathe out as much air as usual, as indicated by their PEFR meter
(PEFR is short for peak expiratory flow rate). Doctors sometimes recommend that older
children use these meters at home to regularly check their breathing.



You should seek emergency treatment if:


It's hard for your child to talk because of asthma


Your child cannot eat or drink because of asthma


Your child is breathing very quickly


Your child's neck muscles are straining and moving quickly


Your child's heartbeat or pulse is very fast


Your child finds it hard to walk


Your child's lips or fingernails turn grey or blue


Your child is exhausted for no apparent reason


Your child seems agitated or confused and is losing consciousness (blacking out).




Your child's doctor, or a practice nurse with special training in asthma, should regularly
check that your child's asthma is under control. They may ask you these types of questions
about your child's symptoms:



Has your child had difficulty sleeping because of their asthma symptoms (including
coughing)?



Has your child had any symptoms during the day (coughing, wheezing, chest tightness,
or breathlessness)?



Has your child's asthma stopped any activities (such as going to school)?


Depending on your answers, they may decide to change your child's treatment."

At least once a year, your doctor, or a nurse with special training in asthma, should
check that your asthma is well controlled. They may ask you questions about your symptoms,
such as:



Have you had difficulty sleeping because of your asthma symptoms (including cough)?


Have you had your usual symptoms during the day (cough, wheeze, chest tightness, or
breathlessness)?



Has your asthma stopped you doing anything (such as your job or housework)?


Depending on your answers, they may suggest that you change your treatment. They may
also do tests to measure your lung function.

If your lung function is poor, or if your symptoms are getting worse, you may need
to increase your dose of medicine, or to add more medicines to your treatment. This
is called stepping up.

But if your asthma is under control, you may be able to reduce your medicines. This
is called stepping down."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/3000138/HIV%3A%20what%20is%20it%3F,HIV: what is it?,"HIV: what is it? Last published: Aug 05, 2021
HIV is a virus that harms the immune system and makes it harder for you to fight infections.
But there are treatments that can help people with HIV stay healthy.

There are also simple things you can do to stop you getting the virus in the first
place. And, if you are in a high-risk group, you should get tested regularly.

What is HIV?
HIV stands for Human Immunodeficiency Virus. If you are infected by the HIV virus it damages your immune system. This makes it
harder to fight off some types of infection, and easier for some cancers to develop.

Without treatment, HIV infection can lead to AIDS. AIDS stands for Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome.

AIDS is the name given to the group of infections and illnesses that develop as the
HIV virus gradually weakens your immune system. Without treatment, AIDS usually develops
between 6 and 9 years after infection with HIV.

HIV spreads in several ways. The most common ones are:


through sexual contact


infection passing from mother to baby, either in the womb or during birth


during breastfeeding, and


sharing infected needles and syringes when injecting 'street' drugs.


Myths and mistakes
When HIV was first known about in the early 1980s, there was no real treatment. In
those first years, millions of people across the world developed AIDS and died.

But good treatments now mean that many people with HIV live fairly normal lives and
don’t die as early.

This is good news. But it also means that many people seem to think that HIV is no
longer a problem and has 'gone away'. This is not true.



In 2019 there were nearly 700,000 HIV-related deaths worldwide.


In the same year, 1.7 million people around the world were infected with HIV.


In parts of Africa the number of people infected with HIV is still growing.


Many people still believe other things about HIV that aren’t true. For example, some
people still think that HIV mainly affects men who have sex with men, or people who
inject illegal drugs.

But the most common way that HIV spreads now is through heterosexual or 'straight'
sex (sex between men and women).

What are the symptoms?
Some of the symptoms of HIV infection can feel a bit like a bout of flu that doesn’t
go away. Symptoms that suggest HIV can include:



fevers and night sweats


tiredness


feeling generally unwell


sore throats and swollen glands in the throat


weight loss


skin rashes


a fungal infection called candidiasis in the mouth


canker sores


diarrhoea


headaches and muscle pain.


If your doctor thinks that you might have HIV, he or she will suggest that you have
an HIV test.

Before the test, your doctor might ask you questions about your medical history and
your lifestyle. This helps you and your doctor to understand whether it is likely
that you have HIV.

For example, your doctor might ask about things that make people more likely to get
HIV, such as:



whether you inject illegal drugs


your sex life: for example, how many sexual partners you have had recently, and whether
you use condoms when you have sex



whether (if you are a man) you have sex with other men


whether any of your sexual partners have HIV


any sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) you have had in the past, including hepatitis.




Your doctor might also want to examine you. This examination might include:


checking your height and weight


checking your skin for rashes and signs of fungal infection


looking inside your mouth to check for candidiasis


listening to your heart and lungs


checking your abdomen to see if your liver is swollen


checking your genitals for signs of STDs.


Sometimes people ask for an HIV test for reasons other than having symptoms. For example,
they might want a test:



if they think they might have been infected through unprotected sex


after an accidental needlestick injury (this sometimes happens to healthcare workers),
or



if they have been injecting drugs unsafely.


In most countries, all pregnant women are routinely tested for HIV.
If you have an HIV test your doctor should explain what might happen if the test is
positive. For example, he or she should explain what treatment you might need to have,
and how having HIV might affect your life.

You should feel free to ask your doctor any questions at any point.
What will happen?
It’s not possible to say what will happen to individual people with HIV. As with all
illnesses, some people do better than others.

But in most people the condition progresses slowly. This means that most people don’t
suddenly become more ill. It usually takes years.

And, with modern antiretroviral treatment (ART), the progress of the disease can be
slowed almost to a standstill, so that you can live a pretty normal life.

ART gives the best results only when you take your medications exactly as prescribed.
Your medical team should give you all the information you need about how to take your
medications, and you should ask them anything you want, at any time.

Because of ART, people with HIV live much longer than they used to. In many countries,
the average life expectancy of people who start ART at age 20 is now between 63 and
67 years old.

But HIV is still a serious illness that can cause lifelong difficulties for many people.
People with HIV have an increased chance of certain other serious health problems,
including heart disease, kidney disease, cancer, and some bone problems.

If you have HIV you should see your doctor regularly, and be aware of the symptoms
of other problems that can happen.

For more information, see our leaflets HIV: long-term complications and HIV: common infections in people with HIV.
Most people find that living well with HIV is easier if they have the support of the
people closest to them. Talking about HIV with your loved ones can be an important
part of staying well.

It’s important that your sexual partners know that you have HIV. If you are anxious
about telling them, talk to your doctor. Your doctor or another person (sometimes
called a facilitator) might be able to help you talk to them, and to anyone else you
are worried about telling.

Staying healthy when you have HIV doesn’t just depend on taking your medications properly.


Good nutrition is crucial when you have an illness that affects your immune system. Talk to your
doctor or nurse about how to eat well.

Practising safe sex helps to keep your sexual partners safe. That means using condoms, and educating
yourself about other safe sex practices.

It’s much easier to stay healthy with HIV when you don’t use drugs, drink alcohol, or smoke. All these things can affect your immune system and make you weaker.

If you can’t stop injecting drugs, talk to your treatment team about how to get clean
needles and syringes. Your doctor might be able to help you get onto a drug treatment
programme.

Many organisations and support groups offer help and information to people with HIV.
Your doctor might be able to help you find support in your area, or you can easily
search online."

An HIV test tells you if you have the HIV virus. Being tested can be worrying, but
modern treatments have dramatically improved the outlook for people who test positive.


If you think you have been exposed to HIV for any reason, see your doctor and get
tested as soon as possible. If you test positive, early treatment leads to the best
possible outcomes.

What is HIV testing?
HIV stands for Human Immunodeficiency Virus. If you are infected by the HIV virus it damages your immune system. This makes it
harder to fight off some types of infection, and easier for some cancers to develop.

HIV spreads in several ways. The most common ones are:


through sexual contact


infection from mother to baby in the womb or during birth


during breastfeeding, and


sharing infected needles and syringes when abusing 'street' drugs.


An HIV test is simply a blood test that can tell if you have been infected with the
HIV virus. Testing can also tell how severe the infection is: this means how much
the virus has multiplied inside the cells in your body.

Who needs an HIV test?
Some people have an HIV test routinely in certain situations. For example, in most
countries, all pregnant women have an HIV test.

And you might have to have an HIV test if you:


apply for certain types of life insurance


apply for certain jobs: for example, as a healthcare worker


visit your doctor and he or she can’t tell straight away what is making you ill


have symptoms similar to those of HIV


have a health condition that is often linked to HIV, such as hepatitis


give blood.


Some people ask to have an HIV test. This is usually because they think they might
have been exposed to the HIV virus.

The main things that can expose you to the HIV virus are:


sharing needles when injecting illegal drugs


having multiple sexual partners, or changing sexual partners often, and not using
condoms when you have sex



being a man who has sex with other men


having sexual partners who have HIV.


If you ask your doctor for a test because you think you might have been exposed to
HIV, he or she will ask you about any symptoms you have been having.

Some of the symptoms of HIV infection can feel a bit like a bout of flu that doesn’t go away. Symptoms that suggest
HIV can include:



fevers and night sweats


tiredness


feeling generally unwell


sore throats and swollen glands in the throat


weight loss


skin rashes


a fungal infection called candidiasis (thrush) in the mouth


mouth ulcers


diarrhoea


headaches and muscle pain.


Before you are tested your doctor should talk to you about what will happen, however the test turns out.

For example, for a positive test, your doctor should talk to you about treatment, how to keep yourself and your loved
ones healthy, and how to talk to your loved ones about HIV.

For a negative test, your doctor should discuss with you how to protect yourself from HIV in the future.
This might include things like using condoms during sex, and safe needle use if you
inject drugs.

As well as HIV, you should also be tested for health problems that often go alongside
HIV, such as:



hepatitis


sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), and


tuberculosis.


You might also be tested for diabetes, and have tests to see how well your liver is
working.

In many countries, people being tested for HIV have two tests. This is because the
main HIV test, called the ELISA test, is not always totally accurate.

So a second, different test, called the Western blot test is used to get a result that’s as accurate as possible.

If you test positive for HIV your doctor should examine you to check on the level
of your general health. This helps your doctor to understand what treatment you need.


So your doctor might check:


your height and weight


the glands in your neck and other areas, for any swelling


your skin, for any signs of rash, fungal infections, or other skin problems


inside your mouth, for thrush (candidiasis, a type of fungal infection), and other
mouth problems that can suggest HIV



your heart and breath sounds, for signs of heart or lung problems


whether you have any swelling in your abdomen


your genitals, for signs of STDs, and


your eyes.


Your doctor might also ask about your mental health. People dealing with mental-health problems sometimes struggle to look after themselves
physically.

Talking to a doctor or healthcare worker about how to deal with HIV and mental-health
issues can help you to keep you safer and healthier.

Some myths and wrong ideas about HIV testing still persist. For example, many years
ago, having an HIV test could affect people’s ability to get life insurance, or might
make it more expensive.

But with modern treatments, and HIV testing being so common now, things like this
should no longer be a problem anywhere.

What will happen?
If you have an HIV test because you think you might have been exposed to the HIV virus,
it’s possible that your lifestyle means that you could be exposed to it again.

So, even if your test is negative, you and your doctor should make a plan to reduce your chance of being exposed to the virus in future. This could involve
things like using condoms for safer sex, or using needles safely if you inject drugs.


If your test is positive, your doctor will want you to start treatment as soon as
possible.

The main treatment for HIV infection is antiretroviral treatment (ART). It works very well, and most people who take it live for many years in fairly good
health. But for it to work you need to take it exactly as prescribed.

If you need to take ART, your doctor will explain exactly how you need to take your
medication. For more information on ART, see our leaflet HIV: antiretroviral treatment (ART).

If you are upset or distressed by a positive test result, or if you are worried about
telling your loved ones, your doctor might be able to arrange for you to have counselling
to help you.

Many organisations and support groups offer help and information to people with HIV
and AIDS. For example, in the UK, the Terrence Higgins Trust (tht.org.uk) has been
providing these services for many years.

Your doctor might be able to help you find support in your area, or you can easily
search online."

If you are at high risk of being infected with HIV - for example, if you are a man
who has sex with men, or if your partner has HIV - your doctor might suggest that
you start treatment with antivirals to protect against infection with the virus.

If you want to know more about PrEP treatment, talk to your doctor.
What is PrEP?
HIV stands for Human Immunodeficiency Virus. If you are infected by the HIV virus it damages your immune system. This makes it
harder to fight off some types of infection, and easier for some cancers to develop.


Without treatment, HIV infection can lead to AIDS. AIDS stands for Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome.

The treatment for HIV is called antiretroviral treatment, or ART for short. People with HIV who are being treated with ART take several antiviral
drugs every day, for the rest of their lives.

These drugs help stop the virus from multiplying in the cells in their bodies. Controlling
the virus in this way limits the damage that it can do, and helps stop people from
becoming more ill.

But many people who don’t have HIV also take a type of ART called PrEP.

PrEP stands for pre-exposure prophylaxis. Prophylaxis is another word for prevention.

If you are at high risk of being infected with HIV, taking PrEP reduces your chances
of being infected.

Reasons why someone might be at high risk of HIV infection include:


being a man who has sex with men


having a partner with HIV


being someone who injects recreational 'street' drugs, such as heroin


being a heterosexual (straight) man or woman who is considered at high risk of infection.


If you take PrEP, you will usually take two antiviral drugs every day. For it to work
properly you have to take it regularly, as prescribed, without missing doses.

Some men who have sex with men might be able to take PrEP in a more as-needed or 'on
demand' way, usually if they only have sex with men occasionally. But this type of
prescribing might not be available everywhere.

Ask your doctor about how PrEP is available where you live.
PrEP has helped to reduce the spread of HIV. But it shouldn’t lead to people becoming
complacent. For example, research suggests that men who take PrEP might be less likely
to use condoms.

PrEP can work well for many people, but it isn’t a 'magic bullet'.
Using a condom can still be the safest way to have sex. This is partly because, while
PrEP can protect against HIV in many people, it doesn’t protect against other sexually
transmitted diseases.

What will happen?
PrEP is hugely helpful in preventing the spread of HIV. But it’s not possible to say
whether it will work for you as an individual.

Also, PrEP it is not a vaccine, and it is not perfect. You have to take it every day,
exactly as prescribed, for it to work properly.

Using condoms is still the most easily available way of preventing the spread of HIV
and other sexually transmitted diseases.

If you think you are at high risk of HIV infection for any reason, talk to your doctor."

Modern treatments mean that HIV can be managed much better than in the past, so that
many people with the infection can live long and fairly healthy lives.

But having HIV can make you more likely to have some other health problems, some of
them serious. Being aware of these problems, and talking to your doctor about any
symptoms you have, can help you stay as healthy as possible.

What is HIV?
HIV stands for Human Immunodeficiency Virus. If you are infected by the HIV virus it damages your immune system. This makes it
harder to fight off some types of infection, and easier for some cancers to develop.


Without treatment, HIV infection can lead to AIDS. AIDS stands for Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome.

AIDS is the name given to the group of infections and illnesses that develop as the
immune system is weakened by the HIV virus. Without treatment, AIDS usually develops
between 6 and 9 years after infection with HIV.

What does 'long-term complications' of HIV mean?
Many medical conditions have what are called 'complications'. It just means that if
you have a certain health problem, it makes you more likely to get certain other ones.

For example, people with diabetes are more likely to have heart problems. This is
because diabetes damages your blood vessels.

HIV is a complicated condition. It affects your immune system and the way many of
the organs in your body work. This means that there are many possible complications.

How likely are complications?
It’s not possible to say what will happen to you as an individual. Some people are
affected by several complications, while some people are not affected by any. And
some complications are more common than others.

But remember, while the list of complications might look scary, these are just possible
problems: they might not happen to you at all.

What we do know is that learning about possible complications, and about their signs
and symptoms, can help you to stay healthy.

What are the main complications I should know about?
The main long-term complications of HIV are listed below. Some are caused by the effect
on the body of the HIV virus. But some are linked to the effects of antiretroviral
treatment (ART), the main treatment for HIV.

This is not really surprising, as all medicines can cause side effects in some people.
The important thing to remember is that knowing about these complications can help
you to stay as healthy as possible.

Low testosterone
Many men with HIV have low levels of testosterone, the 'male hormone'. As well as
a reduced sex drive, low testosterone can lead to other health problems, including
weaker bones and muscles.

Treatment is fairly simple, and is called testosterone replacement therapy (TRT).
It involves taking testosterone supplements. But the treatment can have side effects,
including an increased chance of heart problems.

So your doctor should explain the possible benefits and risks of this treatment so
you can decide whether it’s right for you.

Heart disease
Doctors know that people with HIV are roughly twice as likely as other people to get
heart disease. So your doctor will keep an eye on your heart health: for example,
you should have regular blood pressure tests.

Keeping your heart in good shape also means eating a healthy diet and being as active
as you can.

Blood clots
You’ve probably heard of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), possibly linked to long-haul
flights. DVT happens when a blood clot forms in a vein, often in the leg, then travels
to one of your lungs where it can cause serious problems.

People with HIV have a slightly increased chance of DVT. Many people with DVT don’t
have any warning symptoms. But some people have swelling and pain in the calf or thigh
of one leg. The affected part of your leg may also feel hot and turn red or purple.


Kidney disease
People with HIV have an increased chance of getting kidney disease, or of their kidney
disease getting worse if they already have it.

Kidney disease is more likely to affect older people with HIV, and people of African
origin.

The symptoms of kidney disease are a little vague. But they include tiredness, nausea,
and urinating more or less than usual. If you notice these symptoms, tell your doctor.

Weakened bones
Bone weakness (osteoporosis) can be caused by HIV or by the treatment, and it increases
your chance of having a fracture. Many people with HIV have low levels of vitamin
D, which can lead to weaker bones.

You can help prevent osteoporosis by staying as active as possible, and by not smoking
or drinking alcohol. Your doctor might also recommend vitamin D supplements.

But if you have HIV you should always talk to your doctor before taking any supplements
- even vitamins.

Some cancers
Before ART medicines were available, many people with HIV would quickly progress to
having AIDS. Many people would die from cancers common in people with AIDS, such as
non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and cervical cancer.

People with HIV are still more likely to be affected by cancer compared with other
people. But ART greatly reduces this risk, and the types of cancer that affect people
with HIV are now similar to those that affect people without HIV.

Liver disease
Many people with HIV have hepatitis. This means that they have an increased chance
of liver problems, which can be serious and sometimes life-threatening.

Treatments for some types of hepatitis have improved a lot in recent years, which
could improve the outlook for many people.

Mental changes
HIV can affect people’s mental health in several ways. Some people find that it can
sometimes affect their memory or their ability to think clearly. And some people are
affected by depression.

Talk to your doctor if you are affected by depression. There are treatments that can
help.

Diabetes
Type 2 diabetes seems to be slightly more common in people with HIV. It’s possible
that taking ART medicines might actually increase your chance of getting diabetes.


Common symptoms of type 2 diabetes are feeling thirsty all the time, and urinating
a lot more than usual. If you are concerned about diabetes, talk to your doctor.

Hearing problems
Hearing problems seem to be more common among people with HIV, but it’s not clear
why. If you start to notice that your hearing is getting worse, talk to your doctor,
as there are good treatments that can help.

Infections
HIV affects your immune system, so it’s not surprising that people with HIV have an
increased chance of some types of infection, including tuberculosis and other lung
problems, and candidiasis (thrush).

Being aware of infections is a vital part of managing HIV, so your doctor should have
discussed this with you right at the start of your treatment. For more information,
see our leaflet HIV: common infections in people with HIV.

What will happen?
It’s not possible to say what will happen to individual people with HIV. As with all
illnesses, some people do better than others.

Because of ART, people with HIV live much longer than they used to. In many countries,
the average life expectancy of people who start ART at age 20 is now between 63 and
67 years old.

But HIV is still a serious illness that can cause lifelong difficulties for many people.
If you have HIV you should see your doctor regularly, and be aware of the symptoms
of other problems that can happen.

Most people find that living well with HIV is easier if they have the support of the
people closest to them. Talking about HIV with your loved ones can be an important
part of staying well.

Staying healthy when you have HIV doesn’t just depend on taking your medications properly.


Good nutrition is crucial when you have an illness that affects your immune system. Talk to your
doctor or nurse about how to eat well.

Practising safe sex helps to keep your sexual partners safe. That means using condoms, and educating
yourself about other safe sex practices.

It’s much easier to stay healthy with HIV when you don’t use drugs, drink alcohol, or smoke. All these things can affect your immune system and make you weaker.

If you can’t stop injecting drugs, talk to your treatment team about how to get clean
needles and syringes. Your doctor might be able to help you get drug treatment.

Many organisations and support groups offer help and information to people with HIV.
For example, in the UK, the Terrence Higgins Trust (tht.org.uk) has been providing
these services for many years.

Your doctor might be able to help you find support in your area, or you can easily
search online."

If you have HIV, your immune system doesn’t work as well as it should. This means
that you’re more likely to get certain infections.

Your doctor should talk to you about the most common infections that can happen when
you have HIV, and about how to prevent and treat them. You might hear them called
'opportunistic' infections.

What is HIV?
HIV stands for Human Immunodeficiency Virus. If you are infected by the HIV virus it damages your immune system. This makes it
harder to fight off some types of infection, and easier for some cancers to develop.


Without treatment, HIV infection can lead to AIDS. AIDS stands for Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome.

AIDS is the name given to the group of infections and illnesses that develop as the
immune system is weakened by the HIV virus. Without treatment, AIDS usually develops
between 6 and 9 years after infection with HIV.

What are 'opportunistic' infections?
If you have HIV, your immune system is weakened. This makes you more likely to get
certain infections alongside HIV. Your doctor might call these 'opportunistic' infections.

The word opportunistic means to take advantage of an opportunity - in simple terms,
to grab your chance when it happens.

So, in people with HIV, some infections grab their chance to take advantage of your
weakened immune system.

Your chance of getting opportunistic infections partly depends on how badly your immune
system has been affected by HIV. Your doctor might talk about your CD4+ count. This roughly means how many blood cells you have that can fight infection.

So the lower your CD4+ count, the greater your chance of getting an infection.
What are the main infections I should know about?
In this leaflet we look at the main infections that affect people with HIV, including
a brief look at their symptoms, and how to prevent and treat them.

It’s important to remember that, while the list of infections might look long and
scary, these are just possible problems: they might not happen to you at all.

You can use our information to talk to your doctor in more detail about any of these
infections that you’re concerned about.

Treatment side effects
Like all medicines, the drugs used to treat opportunistic infections in HIV can have
unpleasant side effects in some people. Your doctor should explain these possible
side effects to you.

Many people with HIV need to take a lot of different drugs. Unfortunately, this means
that side effects of medications are a fact of life for many people with HIV.

Some drugs can also interact badly with each other to cause problems. If you notice
any side effects that your doctor didn’t mention, or that seem unusual, tell your
doctor.

Tuberculosis
The symptoms of tuberculosis (TB) can be a bit vague and general. They include fever,
weight loss, and feeling generally unwell. But TB is common enough in people with
HIV that doctors should be on the lookout for it.

TB is treated with antibiotics to kill the bacteria that cause the infection.
But treatment can be complicated, as the antibiotics can sometimes react badly with
antiretroviral treatment (ART) used to treat HIV. So your doctor will want to keep
a close eye on you.

When you’re first diagnosed with HIV you should have what’s called a tuberculin skin
test. This test can tell if you have what’s called latent TB. This means that you
have the infection but it’s not causing you any problems at the moment.

If you have HIV and latent TB, you should have antibiotic treatment to get rid of
the infection.

Disseminated MAC disease
MAC stands for mycobacterium avium complex. It’s a bacterial infection that affects
people with weakened immune systems. Without treatment it can cause serious problems,
including severe damage to the lungs.

Like TB, MAC disease is fairly common in people with HIV, so doctors know to look
out for it. Symptoms include fever, night sweats, weight loss, and sometimes stomach
problems.

MAC disease is treated with long-term antibiotics, and some people have to take antibiotics
for the rest of their lives to stop the condition from coming back.

People with very low CD4+ counts, or who cannot have ART for any reason, might need
to take antibiotics to prevent MAC disease.

Pneumonia
People with HIV can be affected by a type of pneumonia called Pneumocystis pneumonia, or PCP for short. You might also hear it called P jirovecii pneumonia.
This type of pneumonia is caused by a fungus that attacks the lungs in people with
weakened immune systems. The symptoms include fever, fatigue, and a dry cough.

PCP is treated with antibiotics. As with some other infections in people with HIV,
some people might have to take long-term antibiotics to stop the infection from coming
back.

Toxoplasmosis
Toxoplasmosis is a parasitic infection. You can get it from infected meat or from
the faeces (poo) of infected cats. In people with strong immune systems it doesn’t
usually cause any problems, and it goes away on its own.

But in people with HIV, toxoplasmosis can cause serious problems, including problems
with the eyes and brain. Symptoms include headaches, confusion, fever, and weakness.


Toxoplasmosis is treated with a combination of medicines.
Unlike some other infections that can happen to people with HIV, most people don’t
need to take long-term medicine for prevention. But people with HIV should not eat
raw or undercooked meat and should avoid direct contact with cat faeces.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV)
CMV is usually harmless in people with a healthy immune system. But it can cause serious
problems in people with HIV, including damage to the eyes and lungs. The symptoms
include fever, aching muscles, and swollen glands.

The infection is treated with antiviral medicines. Taking your normal ART medicines
as prescribed helps prevent CMV by stopping your CD4+ count from falling too low.


Cryptococcus infection
Cryptococcus is a fungal infection. The symptoms include fever, headache, chest pain,
and coughing. Without treatment it can lead to meningitis.

The infection can usually be treated fairly easily with antifungal drugs. But people
with severe symptoms sometimes need to have more intensive treatment, including daily
lumbar punctures during treatment to test the spinal fluid for infection.

Cryptococcus can also lead to a reaction in some people, called Immune Reconstitution
Inflammatory Syndrome, or IRIS for short.

IRIS happens, strangely, when your immune system starts to get better. What then happens
is that your strengthened immune system over-reacts to the cryptococcus or to another
opportunistic infection, making you ill.

People who have IRIS usually need to have long-term antifungal treatment, and sometimes
medicines to reduce inflammation (swelling) in some parts of the body.

People with very low CD4+ counts may also need to have long-term antifungal treatment,
to stop the infection coming back.

Mucocutaneous candidiasis (thrush)
Thrush is a fungal infection that usually affects the mouth and throat. In women it
can also affect the vagina. It isn’t usually serious but it is unpleasant and annoying.


Symptoms of vaginal thrush include itching, swelling, and discharge. Thrush in the
mouth and throat can cause swelling and make it hard to swallow food and liquids.


Thrush is fairly common in people with HIV, but it’s also fairly easy to treat using
short courses of antifungal drugs. Taking antifungals to prevent thrush from coming
back isn’t usually recommended, as the infection can become resistant to the drugs.


What will happen?
While it’s not possible to say what will happen to individual people with HIV, opportunistic
infections are more likely when your CD4+ count is low.

Taking your ART medications properly as prescribed helps keep your CD4+ count high.


How well you recover from opportunistic infections varies depending on how well you
are when you get the infection, and on the type of infection.

For example, candidiasis (thrush) is common, but it is usually fairly easy to treat
and rarely causes serious problems. Other infections, while possibly less common,
can be harder to treat. And some, like TB and pneumonia, can sometimes be fatal.

Staying healthy and preventing infections when you have HIV doesn’t just depend on
taking your medications properly.

Good nutrition is crucial when you have an illness that affects your immune system. Talk to your
doctor or nurse about how to eat well.

Practising safe sex helps to keep your sexual partners safe. That means using condoms, and educating
yourself about other safe sex practices.

It’s much easier to stay healthy with HIV when you don’t use drugs, drink alcohol, or smoke. All these things can affect your immune system and make you weaker.

If you can’t stop injecting drugs, talk to your treatment team about how to get clean
needles and syringes. Your doctor might be able to help you get drug treatment.

Many organisations and support groups offer help and information to people with HIV.
For example, in the UK, the Terrence Higgins Trust (tht.org.uk) has been providing
these services for many years.

search online."

HIV is a virus that harms the immune system so that it’s harder for your body to fight
infections. If you have HIV, treatment with ART can help you to stay healthy.

Treatments for HIV
HIV stands for Human Immunodeficiency Virus. If you are infected by the HIV virus it damages your immune system.

Drug treatment for HIV is called antiretroviral treatment (ART). ART uses drugs that stop the HIV virus from multiplying, so that it does less damage.


Keeping the virus under control in this way helps you to stay as healthy as possible.
ART drugs are called antiretrovirals (HIV is a type of virus called a retrovirus).


Without treatment, HIV infection can lead to AIDS. AIDS stands for Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome.

AIDS is the name given to the group of infections and illnesses that develop as the
HIV virus gradually weakens the immune system. Without treatment, AIDS usually develops
between 6 and 9 years after infection with HIV.

ART has been shown to:


help stop HIV from progressing (getting worse)


reduce the chances of illnesses that can sometimes go along with HIV


help prevent HIV from spreading, and


greatly reduce deaths from HIV.


If you test positive for HIV it is recommended that you start treatment with ART
as soon as possible.

Types of ART
There are two main types of ART. The one we look at here is for people who have tested
positive for HIV and who need lifelong drug treatment.

The second type is called pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Prophylaxis is another word for prevention.

People who take PrEP don’t have HIV but are at high risk of being infected with HIV
- perhaps, for example, because their partner has HIV. They take PrEP daily as a precaution.
To find out more about PrEP, see our leaflet HIV: prevention treatment (PrEP) for people at high risk.

Before treatment starts
Testing positive for HIV can be upsetting and frightening. You will probably have
a lot of questions for your doctor. And he or she will want to give you all the information
you need about treatment and living well with HIV.

But dealing with that kind of information is hard when you’ve just been diagnosed
with HIV. So it makes sense to slow things down a bit, to take stock of your feelings,
and perhaps to talk to your loved ones about your diagnosis.

Ideally, you should have some counselling to help you deal with the diagnosis and
understand the changes that will happen in your life.

This doesn’t mean that your treatment will be delayed. But your doctor will understand
that, as well as drug treatment, you might need time and help to accept and understand
what is happening.

Many people find counselling helpful. It should focus on how you can get the best
out of treatment and stay as healthy as possible. So you and your counsellor should
discuss things that will help, including:



understanding your treatment and how to take your medicines as prescribed


preventing and treating infections that can happen when you have HIV. You might hear
your doctor call these 'opportunistic' infections



getting good nutrition, and taking the right supplements, to boost your immune system
and help you stay healthy and avoid infections. You should talk to your doctor before
taking any supplements



staying well through healthy behaviours, and


any questions you have about HIV.


Starting treatment and 'staging'
The treatment you need will partly depend on what stage your illness has reached.


'Staging' just means understanding what stage your illness has reached. It helps doctors
to understand what kind of treatment you need.

Different health authorities around the world have different ways of staging HIV.
But they are broadly similar, so that:



stage 0 or 1 is early-stage HIV, when someone might just have mild symptoms


stage 2 means someone has moderate symptoms, and


stage 3 or 4 is more severe, advanced illness, which could be developing into AIDS.


Your doctor will decide what stage your illness is at, depending on your symptoms.
Your ART can then be tailored to what will help you the most at that stage.

Your doctor will probably recommend that you start treatment as soon as possible -
maybe on the same day as your diagnosis. The earlier you start treatment, the better
the results are likely to be.

What are ART drugs?
The drugs used to treat ART are called antiretrovirals. There are several different
ones, and the ones that people are prescribed can vary from country to country. But
they all do the same job.

For the best results you will probably be prescribed three different antiretrovirals.
The combination of drugs you are offered will depend on several things, including:




the stage of your illness


how well the drugs work together


how easy they are to take, and


their known side effects when taken together.


The combination of drugs you are prescribed might change from time to time. This might
happen if the drugs don’t work well enough, or if you struggle with side effects.


When you take ART you will have regular tests to see if the drugs are doing their
job of stopping the virus from copying itself in your cells.

Sometimes these tests show that the drugs are not working well enough, and the person
needs to start treatment with a new group of drugs.

The most common reason that treatment fails in this way is when people don’t take
their medication as prescribed: for example, if they miss a few doses.

When this happens the virus survives and gets stronger, and those drugs won’t work
for you any more. So it’s vital to get into the habit of taking your medication when
you’re supposed to.

Side effects of ART
Unfortunately, like all medicines, antiretrovirals can cause side effects. These can
include:



fatigue


nausea and vomiting


diarrhoea, and


mood changes.


Trying different medications can help reduce side effects. And you can also talk to
your doctor or counsellor about how to manage them.

For example, taking regular rest breaks can help with fatigue, and eating smaller
meals and avoiding spicy foods can help with nausea.

You should avoid alcohol when taking ART. Drinking alcohol weakens the immune system
so that the drugs don’t work as well. Talk to your doctor or counsellor if you need
help to stop drinking.

Another side effect of ART is that it might actually increase your chances of getting
some other health problems, such as diabetes or heart problems.

We don’t understand this as well as we’d like to, and more research is being done
to find out more. For more information, see our leaflet HIV: long-term complications.

Drug interactions
Drug interactions happen when you take medicines that react badly with each other,
causing you problems or side effects.

Doctors know that some ART medicines don’t react well with others, so your doctor
should plan your treatment carefully. But this is not always easy.

For example, if you need to be treated for complications or infections, you will need
to take extra medicines that might interact badly with your ART drugs.

Your doctor should know about these possible drug interactions and should discuss
them with you, and how to spot any unusual side effects.

To find out more, see our leaflet: HIV: common infections in people with HIV.
What will happen?
It’s not possible to say what will happen to individual people with HIV. As with all
illnesses, some people do better than others.

But in most people the condition progresses slowly. This means that most people don’t
suddenly become more ill. It usually takes years.

And ART can often slow the progress of the disease almost to a standstill, so that
you can live a pretty normal life.

But the best results only happen when you take your medications exactly as prescribed.
Your medical team should give you all the information you need about how to take your
medications, and you should ask them anything you want, at any time.

Because of ART, people with HIV live much longer than they used to. In many countries,
the average life expectancy of people who start ART at age 20 is now between 63 and
67 years old.

But HIV is still a serious illness that can cause lifelong difficulties for many people.
People with HIV have an increased chance of certain other serious health problems,
including heart disease, kidney disease, cancer, and some bone problems.

If you have HIV you should see your doctor regularly, and be aware of the symptoms
of other problems that can happen.

Most people find that living well with HIV is easier if they have the support of the
people closest to them. Talking about HIV with your loved ones can be an important
part of staying well.

It’s important that your sexual partners know that you have HIV. If you are anxious
about telling them, talk to your doctor. Your doctor or another person (sometimes
called a facilitator) might be able to help you talk to them, and to anyone else you
are worried about telling.

Staying healthy when you have HIV doesn’t just depend on taking your medications properly.


Good nutrition is crucial when you have an illness that affects your immune system. Talk to your
doctor or nurse about how to eat well.

Practising safe sex helps to keep your sexual partners safe. That means using condoms, and educating
yourself about other safe sex practices.

It’s much easier to stay healthy with HIV when you don’t use drugs, drink alcohol, or smoke. All these things can affect your immune system and make you weaker.

If you can’t stop injecting drugs, talk to your treatment team about how to get clean
needles and syringes. Your doctor might be able to help you get drug treatment.

Many organisations and support groups offer help and information to people with HIV.
For example, in the UK, the Terrence Higgins Trust (tht.org.uk) has been providing
these services for many years.

Your doctor might be able to help you find support in your area, or you can easily
search online."

Being pregnant should be a happy time in a woman’s life. But having HIV at the same
time as being pregnant can cause worry and uncertainty.

Getting treatment can help protect you and your child from serious health problems.


Having HIV and being pregnant
What is HIV?
HIV stands for Human Immunodeficiency Virus. If you are infected by the HIV virus it damages your immune system. This makes it
harder to fight off some types of infection, and easier for some cancers to develop.


HIV spreads in several ways. The most common ones are:


through sexual contact


infection passing from mother to baby in the womb or during birth


during breastfeeding, and


by sharing infected needles and syringes when injecting 'street' drugs.


For more background information on HIV, see our leaflet: HIV: what is it?
Pregnancy and HIV testing
In most countries, all women are tested for HIV at the start of their pregnancy.
If your test is negative, but you are at high risk of being infected with HIV, your
doctor should arrange for you to be tested again later in your pregnancy.

Reasons why you might be at high risk of HIV infection include:


having a partner with HIV


being someone who injects recreational 'street' drugs, such as heroin


being a heterosexual (straight) woman who is considered at high risk of infection.
There are several reasons for this, including having multiple sexual partners, or
being less able to make good decisions about safe sex because of drug use or mental-health
issues.



If you test positive for HIV after becoming pregnant, or if you become pregnant and
you already know that you have HIV, your doctor should begin to take steps to help
you protect yourself and your unborn child.

To help your doctor get an idea of the help you need, he or she will ask you about
your life, including questions about:



your home life, and the people in your life who can support and help you


what people in your life know that you have HIV


whether you are able to tell the people closest to you, such as your family, about
having HIV



whether you feel able to tell your sexual partners, or other people who might need
to know, such as drug users that you share needles with. Your doctor might be able
to help with talking to these people.



Your doctor should also ask you about whether you need help with mental-health issues,
or to stop smoking or using drugs.

You might feel uncomfortable answering personal questions. But your doctor needs to
know as much as possible in order to give you the best help.

You will also need to have a physical examination and some tests. Your doctor will
mainly be looking for signs of other illnesses that can happen when someone has HIV.
These can include:



tuberculosis


viral hepatitis, and


sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).


Your doctor will also check your medical history and ask you about things such as:


what medicines you are taking and have taken in the past


whether you use illegal drugs, and


whether you have had all the vaccinations that you should have.


Treatment when pregnant
If you test positive for HIV after becoming pregnant, you will need to start treatment
straight away.

Treatment for HIV is called antiretroviral treatment (ART). To learn more about ART,
see our leaflet HIV: antiretroviral treatment (ART).

You will need to take ART during the whole of your pregnancy, and probably for the
rest of your life. Your baby will also need treatment.

ART greatly reduces the chance that you will pass HIV on to your baby.


Without treatment, between 15 and 45 in 100 women with HIV will pass HIV on to their
babies.



With treatment, including ART, only 1 or 2 in 100 women will pass HIV on to their
babies.



Even with good treatment, pregnant women with HIV face a difficult time, including
an increased chance of problems during and after the birth. For example, it is more
likely that:



you might need a caesarean delivery


your waters might break early


you might give birth early


you might have dangerously high blood pressure while pregnant (pre-eclampsia)


you might need to be treated in an intensive care unit (ICU).


There is some evidence that some ART drugs can cause problems during pregnancy, as
well as birth defects in babies.

But your doctor should know about these problems and should avoid giving you the drugs
that can cause them unless there is no alternative.

Because the benefits of ART for mothers and babies are so great, these risks are considered
small by comparison.

Your doctor should discuss possible problems and side effects of ART with you. And
you should ask any questions that you want to, at any stage of your pregnancy and
treatment.

Having your baby
You should have regular blood tests during your pregnancy to see how well the ART
drugs are working.



If the drugs are doing their job well and reducing the amount of the HIV virus in
your body, you should be able to give birth normally. This is because you are not
likely to pass the virus on to your baby.



If you still have fairly high levels of the HIV virus in your blood, there is more
chance that you will pass the virus on to your baby during a normal birth. So you
will probably need to have a caesarean at 38 weeks into your pregnancy.



Breastfeeding
Breastfeeding is not recommended for mothers with HIV, as the virus can be passed
to your baby in your milk.

In some lower-income countries, formula feeding is not always possible. This might
be because formula milk is expensive, or because safe water is not easily available.


In these cases, doctors should work with mothers to reduce the chance of passing on
the virus. For example, the baby should be treated with ART during the breastfeeding
months.

But in most middle-income and higher-income countries, mothers with HIV should only
use formula milk.

Staying well after giving birth
All new mothers should have regular check-ups with health visitors, nurses, or doctors
in the weeks after giving birth. Mothers with HIV should also be seen by an HIV specialist.


Your doctor or nurse will want to check on your physical health. For example, he or
she will want to check that you are healing well, especially if you had a caesarean.


But he or she will also want to check that you are okay in other ways. For example,
many women living with HIV neglect their own health while caring for their children
and family members. So your doctor or nurse will want to help you to stay well. You
might be offered various kinds of help with things like:



specialist HIV treatment


family planning


mental health or substance abuse treatment services, and


food, housing, transport, and legal services, if needed.


Women with HIV tend to have more mental-health problems compared with other women.
So your doctor or nurse should be aware that you might be more likely to have postnatal
depression.

If you begin to feel depressed or overwhelmed after your baby is born, talk to your
healthcare workers, who should be able to help.

What will happen?
Women with HIV have an increased chance of complications during pregnancy and birth,
including infections and long hospital stays.

But having a baby when you have HIV shouldn’t cause any other health problems compared
with other women with HIV.

With good care, most women don’t pass HIV on to their babies. But babies born to mothers
with HIV are more likely to have problems such as low birth weight and temporary breathing
problems.

With all the stresses and demands of looking after a new baby, taking your ART medications
as prescribed can be difficult. But it’s important that you do. ART only works properly
if you take it as prescribed without missing any doses.

If you are struggling to stick to your treatment, tell your doctor. He or she will
want to help you to stay healthy.

Many charities and other organisations offer help and support to people with HIV.


For example, in the UK, the Terrence Higgins Trust (tht.org.uk) offers a wide range
of information and services, including about being pregnant with HIV.

And Positively UK (positivelyuk.org) offers help especially for women with HIV.
Your healthcare workers might be able to help you find support in your area, or you
could search online."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/3000213/Hip%20replacement%20surgery,Hip replacement surgery,"Hip replacement surgery Last published: Mar 14, 2022
This information tells you about an operation to replace one of your hips. It explains
how the operation is done, how it can help, what the risks are, and what to expect
afterwards.

Procedures and practices can vary slightly between hospitals. You can use our information
to discuss your operation with the doctors and nurses treating you.

What is a hip replacement?
The hip joint is at the top of your leg. It is a type of joint called a ball-and-socket joint. The ball is the top of the thigh bone (the femur), which fits into the hip
socket.

Hip replacement is usually done as a treatment for severe arthritis of the hip. You
might hear it called osteoarthritis. Arthritis can be very painful and can stop your hip from working properly.

When you have a hip replacement a surgeon removes parts of your hip bones that have
been damaged by arthritis and replaces them with artificial hip parts. The artificial
joint is called a prosthesis.

Why might I need a hip replacement?
Most people with arthritis of the hip don’t need a hip replacement. But your doctor
might suggest it if, for example:



you are in constant pain


your pain stops you from sleeping


other treatments, such as physiotherapy and medications, have not helped enough to
reduce your pain or to help you be more mobile



you struggle to do everyday things and become less independent: for example, you might
have trouble getting out of the bath or tying your shoelaces



your pain and the problems it causes are making you depressed


you can no longer easily visit family and friends


your hip arthritis is stopping you from working.


What happens during the operation?
A total hip replacement is a major operation. It takes between one and two hours.
You will need either a general anaesthetic or an epidural so that you don’t feel anything during the operation.



With a general anaesthetic you sleep through the operation.


An epidural is an injection into your spine. The lower part of your body will be numb
but you’ll be awake. You won't be able to see the surgery, but you will be able to
hear what's going on. A nurse or anaesthetist will probably talk to you from time
to time, to ask how you are and let you know what’s happening.



The operation happens in several stages:


First, the top end of the thigh bone, including the ball part of the ball-and-socket
joint, is cut off and removed.



A steel (or sometimes ceramic) ball on a stem is then set into the thigh bone in place
of the old bone.



The hip socket is drilled out a little to make room for the new artificial socket,
which is usually made of plastic. The ball part of the joint will then fit into this
new socket.



The surgeon might use special cement to stick the new prosthetic bones to your bones.
But some types of artificial hip joint don’t need cement.



Some people need a blood transfusion during the operation to replace the blood lost
during surgery.



Different types of hip replacement
There are many different types of hip replacement joint. You can talk to your doctor
about which are available for you, and about which of these is most suitable.

One type that you might have heard of, but that is not used much anymore is the metal-on-metal (MoM) hip joint (so called because both parts are made of metal).

There have been concerns that this type of hip replacement joint might wear away more
quickly than others. It’s possible that this might damage the tissue near the joint,
and that traces of metal could leak into the bloodstream.

You are not likely to be offered this type of joint as it is not thought to be the
best option for most people. If you are offered it, ask your doctor why.

It’s recommended that people who have this type of hip replacement should have check-ups
every year to monitor for any problems.

What are the risks?
There are risks with all operations, and your surgeon should talk through these before
your surgery.

Anaesthetics
One common cause of problems is anaesthetics, which can have side effects, including feeling nauseous (sick) for a while after
your operation.

Some people have an allergic reaction to the anaesthetic. You should tell your doctor before the operation about any allergies
you have.

Anaesthetics can also cause breathing problems and heart problems. These problems
are serious but rare. And your blood pressure, heartbeat, temperature, and breathing
will be closely monitored during your operation.

Other possible problems
As with many types of operation, some problems can happen during or soon after surgery,
while others happen over the longer term.

This list of possible problems might look long. But remember, these are things that
might happen, not things that definitely will happen. Many people who have hip replacements
have no problems at all.

Possible short-term problems


Problems urinating. If you can't urinate for a short while after your operation you will need to have
a small tube (called a catheter) placed in your bladder to drain the urine.

This is fairly common after this surgery. Some people get a urinary tract infection
(UTI). If this happens you will need antibiotics.



A blood clot in your legs. Doctors call this deep vein thrombosis (DVT). If this happens you will need medication to thin your blood until the clot goes
away.

To help prevent blood clots you will probably be given special elastic stockings to
wear after your operation. You might also be given blood-thinning drugs.

If you are thought to be at increased risk of blood clots you might need to take them
for several weeks after you go home.



A blood clot in your lungs. Sometimes a DVT can travel through your blood to your lungs. Doctors call this a
pulmonary embolism. This is rare but serious.



Damage to the nerves in your leg. The large nerve that runs down the back of the thigh can be damaged during the operation.
This can make your foot floppy and weak. This is rare and most people recover. But
some people need an operation to treat the problem.



A broken hip. The bones in your hip can crack during the operation. This is rare and the surgeon
can usually fix it during your hip replacement operation. But it could delay your
recovery.



A heart attack, stroke, or chest infection. Any major operation puts a strain on your heart, brain, and chest. These problems
are rare with this surgery but they do happen.

These problems are more likely to happen if you already have heart or lung problems.
It is a good idea to stop smoking before an operation, as this makes these problems
less likely.



A wound infection. This is a risk of any type of operation. If this happens you will need antibiotics.



A hip infection. It is rare to get an infection in your new hip. But if it happens you might need
to have a new hip fitted.



Your new hip coming apart. This is not common but it can be very frightening and painful. If this happens it
will probably be in the first few weeks after your operation, but it can also happen
months later. If your hip dislocates in this way, you might need another small operation
to fix it.



Damage to major blood vessels. This is rare, but it can happen during the operation if an instrument tears a hole
in one of the large blood vessels near the hip.



Dying during the operation. This happens to 3 or 4 in every 1000 people who have this type of surgery.



Possible longer-term problems


One leg becomes slightly longer than the other. The leg with the new hip can end up slightly longer than the other leg. If this
happens you might need to wear shoes with a raised heel so that you don't limp.



The new hip becomes loose. If this happens you might need another operation to replace the loose hip with a
new one.



Infection. Infections are usually a short-term problem when you have surgery. But artificial
hips can sometimes become infected months or years after surgery. If this happens,
you might need another operation to replace the infected hip with a new one.



Wear and tear. Most replacement hips last for at least 10 years, and often much longer. But if
yours stops working properly you can have an operation to replace it. Surgeons call
this a revision. But revisions take longer and problems are more likely.



What can I expect afterwards?
A hip replacement is a major operation. You will have a large scar, which will be
closed with stitches or clips and covered with a waterproof dressing.

You will be given painkillers. But if they don’t help enough you must tell a nurse
or doctor. Being in pain can slow your recovery and there is no need for you to suffer.

Immediately after your operation
After your operation you will go to a recovery area until you are fully awake. You
will have a drip in your arm.

You might also notice one or two small plastic tubes in the top of your leg. These
are drains. They stop fluid collecting under your scar. The drip and the drains come out after
one or two days.

If you had an epidural anaesthetic, you might not be able to feel or move your legs for several hours after
your operation.

But you also won’t have any pain. Some hospitals leave epidurals in place for a day
or so after surgery, to stop your new hip from hurting.

During your stay in hospital
It’s hard to say how long you’ll need to stay in hospital after your operation. But
it will usually be between 1 and 5 days, depending on what type of surgery you had,
and your age and general health.

If you are fairly young and generally in good health you might be able to go home
more quickly. Your surgeon might also suggest that you start to move about as early
as a few hours after your operation. But some people need more recovery time.

Physiotherapy and recovery
While in hospital you should be helped with some basic physiotherapy. This could include
trying to do things like:



getting out of a chair


walking with a frame, or


walking with sticks (until you can walk by yourself).


Your pain and stiffness should pass fairly quickly. But it can take months or weeks
before you feel normal again after a major operation. It’s normal to feel emotional
and teary during this time.

Going home
You will need to take care of your new hip - and of yourself - while you recover and
get used to moving about. So ask your family and friends to help around the house
and with chores, such as shopping and collecting prescriptions.

You might not be able to do simple things for a while, like putting on your own socks
and shoes. This is normal.

You might want to think about useful aids and appliances, such as an extra hand rail
in the shower. Ask to see an occupational therapist before you go into hospital, so that it can be arranged for when you go home.

Many people need more help for a while after their operation. If you’re struggling,
ask your doctor if they can help to arrange for more help.

There are some simple but important things about your recovery that your doctor and
physiotherapist should discuss with you before you go home. For example:



don’t cross your legs. Crossing your legs could dislocate your new hip



don't bend over more than 90 degrees. Bending low can dislocate your hip



don’t do anything that makes your new hip feel sore or uncomfortable



do sleep on your back for six weeks after your operation



do be extra careful for the first couple of months after your operation. This is when
you’re most likely to dislocate your new hip



do take regular exercise. Exercise is great for your new hip, and for you. Walking,
swimming, and cycling are fine. But avoid activities that jolt or jar your hips such
as running or tennis. Ask your physiotherapist before you leave hospital for advice
about exercise



do contact your doctor if you notice increased pain, redness, or fluid in your hip joint.
Your surgeon should tell you about problems to look out for before you leave hospital.



Most surgeons recommend you avoid sex for 6 to 8 weeks after your operation.
You should be able to drive about 6 weeks after surgery. If you have a job that’s
not physical, such as an office job, you will need about 6 weeks off. If your job
involves a lot of standing, you will probably need more time to recover."

You need cholesterol to stay healthy. But having too much can increase your chance
of heart problems or a stroke. Here, we look at treatments for people who have high
cholesterol but have not been diagnosed with heart or circulation problems.

What is high cholesterol?
Cholesterol is a waxy, fatty substance found in all the cells in your body. It is
carried around your body in your blood.

There are two kinds of cholesterol, and your body needs both types. However, having
too much cholesterol - or having too much of the wrong type - can increase your chance
of serious heart and circulation problems, such as heart attacks and strokes. The
two types of cholesterol are:



LDL cholesterol. This is often called 'bad cholesterol', as it can build up in your blood vessels
and cause blockages if you have too much. This increases your risk of heart and circulation
problems.



HDL cholesterol, or 'good cholesterol'. This type helps to reduce the amount of bad cholesterol in
your blood.



When discussing your cholesterol, your doctor may also talk about another potentially
harmful type of fat in your blood called triglycerides.

How is high cholesterol diagnosed?
If you've been told you have high cholesterol, this usually means that one, or both,
of the following is true:



You have too much cholesterol in your blood overall


You have too much bad (LDL) cholesterol in your blood in particular.


To check your cholesterol, your doctor will take a sample of your blood and do a test
called a lipids profile. 'Lipids' is what doctors call the fats in your blood, including your cholesterol
and triglycerides.

Most people have a lipids profile as part of a general health check-up. You may be
asked not to eat anything for 12 hours or so before this test.

The amount of cholesterol in your blood is measured using millimoles per litre (mmol/L).
As a rough guide, doctors often say a person's cholesterol is at a healthy level if:




their total cholesterol is under 5.2 mmol/L ('total cholesterol' includes their good
and bad cholesterol and a portion of their triglycerides)



their bad (LDL) cholesterol is under 2.6 mmol/L.


But having cholesterol levels above these numbers doesn't necessarily mean that you
need treatment for your cholesterol.

Your doctor will look at several things to work out your overall chance of heart and
circulation problems and whether you need treatment for high cholesterol. You might
hear your doctor call these things 'risk factors'. These may include:



your age


whether you smoke


your family history of heart and circulation problems


whether you are overweight, and


whether you have certain health problems, such as high blood pressure, kidney disease,
or diabetes.



What treatments work?
Doctors usually recommend that all people with high cholesterol make changes to their
lifestyle. This is sometimes the only treatment people need to lower their cholesterol.
But your doctor will probably recommend taking medicines as well if:



your level of bad (LDL) cholesterol is very high, or


you have a high risk of heart and circulation problems, or


lifestyle changes alone don't improve your cholesterol enough.


Lifestyle changes
Changing what you eat
The amount of fat you eat can affect your cholesterol levels. This doesn't mean that
all fat is bad. You just need to be careful about the types of fat you eat. The less
healthy kinds of fat are called saturated fats and trans fats.



Saturated fats are found in meat and dairy products.


Trans fats are found in some fast foods, biscuits, and baked goods.


In general, less healthy fats are solid at room temperature.


Healthier types tend to be liquids, such as olive oil and some other vegetable oils.
These healthier types of fat are called polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fats.



To reduce your bad fats, try to eat only lean cuts of meat, and only fat-free or low-fat
dairy products. You should also avoid common sources of bad fats, such as fast food.

Your doctor may also recommend eating more fish, and also more foods that are high
in fibre, including fruit and vegetables, nuts, beans, and wholegrain foods.

Making changes to your diet can be hard. Your doctor may refer you to a dietitian
to come up with an eating plan that suits your needs and tastes.

Exercising regularly
This means getting a moderate amount of exercise several times a week. Types of exercise
can include walking briskly, swimming, playing sports, or cycling.

Your doctor can provide advice on what types of exercise might be best for you, how
much you should do, and for how long.

For most people, doctors recommend exercising at a moderate intensity (enough to feel
their heart beating and increase their breathing) for 30 minutes, at least three days
a week.

You don’t need to do the 30 minutes all at one time. It can be broken into bouts of
physical activity of at least 10 minutes each.

Losing weight (if you're overweight)
Exercising regularly and changing your diet to improve your cholesterol can have another
benefit - it can help you lose weight. And losing weight can improve your cholesterol
further in turn. You can discuss your weight-loss goals with your doctor and work
out a plan to reach them.

Taking plant sterols and stanols
These are natural substances found in plants that are similar to human cholesterol.
They help lower cholesterol levels by competing with cholesterol to be absorbed by
the body.

Natural sources of sterols and stanols include wheat germ oil, soybean oil, corn oil,
sesame seeds, nuts, and some fruits such as oranges and figs.

But the amounts of sterols and stanols in these foods is too small to have much effect
on your cholesterol levels. So treatment with stanols and sterols usually involves
taking supplements.

You might also eat foods enriched with higher amounts of these substances, such as
enriched spreads, yoghurts, fruit juices, and cereal bars.

Stopping smoking
Studies suggest that smoking raises your bad (LDL) cholesterol and lowers your good
(HDL) cholesterol. Besides raising bad cholesterol, smoking is one of the main risk
factors for serious heart and circulation problems, such as heart attacks and strokes.

By stopping smoking, you can greatly reduce your risk of these problems. Your doctor
can provide advice and support, as well as treatments, to help you stop.

Medicines
Statins are the main drug treatment for reducing high cholesterol, and they work well for
most people. There are several different ones.

If your cholesterol is still too high while taking a statin, your doctor may increase
your dose or try a different statin.

Statins can cause side effects in some people. You may need to have blood tests every
so often to make sure treatment doesn't damage your liver. Some people who take statins
get muscle pain or muscle damage. Tell your doctor if you notice any muscle pain or
weakness.

Other drugs are sometimes used to treat high cholesterol. For most people, these drugs
aren't as good as statins. But they can be helpful for people who aren't able to take
statins because of side effects.

What will happen to me?
If you've been diagnosed with high cholesterol, making lifestyle changes and taking
medicines can work well to improve your cholesterol and reduce your chance of serious
heart and circulation problems. Your doctor may also recommend treating other conditions,
such as high blood pressure, to further reduce your risk.

To get the full benefit of these treatments and lifestyle changes, you need to commit
to them over the long term. Your doctor will regularly check your cholesterol levels
and adjust your treatment if necessary."

If you have high blood pressure you probably won't feel ill. But having high blood
pressure increases your chance of serious health problems, including heart attacks
and strokes. There are good treatments, and things you can do yourself, to reduce
your blood pressure.

You can use our information to talk to your doctor and decide which treatments are
right for you.

What treatments work?
When doctors take your blood pressure, they measure how hard your blood pushes against
your blood vessels as it moves around your body. You need some pressure to keep the
blood moving. But if the pressure is too high, over time it can damage your blood
vessels.

This can cause problems such as heart attacks, strokes, eye problems, and kidney damage.
Your blood pressure rises and falls slightly throughout the day and night. But when
it stays above a certain level, it's called high blood pressure. High blood pressure
is also called hypertension.

You may be able to reduce your blood pressure by making changes to your lifestyle.
But most people need to take medicines too.

Lifestyle changes
There are lots of things you can do to reduce your blood pressure.
If you are overweight, losing some weight, even a couple of kilograms, may help to bring your blood pressure down. If you are
being treated for high blood pressure, losing weight may make the treatment work better
and reduce how much of the medicine you need.

Eating a type of diet called the DASH diet, which stands for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension.

On this diet you eat:


plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables


more wholegrain products (such as brown rice and wholemeal bread) instead of white
rice and white bread



more fish, poultry, and nuts, instead of red meat


less salt. Most of us eat more salt than we need. A low-salt diet means eating less
than 2 grams of salt a day. Many processed foods such as bread and breakfast cereal
contain a lot of salt. Check the labels to find out



less saturated fat (butter, meat, cheese, and cream)


fewer sugary foods, such as cakes and sweets, and fewer sugary drinks.


Your doctor might also recommend that you eat more foods that are rich in a mineral
called potassium. Potassium-rich foods include:



some fresh fruits, such as bananas, oranges, melons, and grapefruit


some dried fruits, such raisins, prunes, and dates


some vegetables, such as cooked broccoli, cooked spinach, potatoes, sweet potatoes,
mushrooms, peas, and cucumbers.



Your doctor might also recommend a potassium supplement. But your doctor will not
recommend more potassium if you have chronic kidney disease or if you take certain
medicines.

Taking regular exercise (such as walking, jogging, or cycling) is also important. Doctors recommend that
most people with high blood pressure get at least 30 minutes of exercise three to
five times a week.

You need to exercise regularly to keep your blood pressure down. If you stop exercising,
it may rise again. Check with your doctor about what type of exercise routine might
be best for you.

If you drink a lot of alcohol, cutting down can reduce your blood pressure.

If you have high blood pressure, smoking can further increase your chance of serious heart and blood pressure problems. So
giving up smoking is important. You can ask your doctor for help.

Medicines
There are many different types of medicine that can lower your blood pressure. Taking
one or more of these medicines can:



help lower your blood pressure


reduce your chance of problems related to high blood pressure (such as a heart attack
or a stroke), and



help you to live longer.


You may need to take more than one medicine to bring your blood pressure down to a
healthy level.

Which medicine (or medicines) you try first will depend on several things, including
how high your blood pressure is and whether you have other medical conditions.

The main blood-pressure medicines all work in slightly different ways, which is one
reason why it often helps to take more than one. These are the main types that your
doctor might recommend:



ACE inhibitors


Diuretics


Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs)


Calcium channel blockers


Beta-blockers.


You'll need regular appointments with your doctor to check on your blood pressure
and your treatments.

Some people get side effects from these medicines. Talk to your doctor if you are
getting any problems. You may be able to take a different type of medicine, or a lower
dose of one or more medicines.

Some medicines come as a combination tablet of several drugs, which some people find
easier to take.

Don’t stop taking your medicines without talking to your doctor. Most people are able
to find treatments that work for them with few, if any, side effects.

Below we've listed some of the more common side effects from blood pressure medicines.




ACE inhibitors: a dry cough, dizziness (especially the first time you take them),
or kidney problems.



Diuretics: dizziness, nausea, sexual problems (such as not being able to get an erection),
muscle cramps, thirst, or needing to pass urine more often.



ARBs: dizziness.


Calcium channel blockers: headaches, dizziness, swollen ankles, flushing, or an abnormal
heartbeat.



Beta-blockers: tiredness, nausea, sexual problems, cold hands, or cold feet. Doctors
usually recommend that people with asthma don't take beta-blockers.

If you have high blood pressure you probably won't feel ill. But having high blood
pressure increases your chance of serious health problems, including heart attacks
and strokes.

There are good treatments, and things you can do yourself, to reduce your blood pressure.


What is high blood pressure?
When doctors take your blood pressure, they measure how hard your blood pushes against
your blood vessels as it moves around your body. You need some pressure to keep the
blood moving. But if the pressure is too high, over time it can damage your blood
vessels.

This can cause problems such as heart attacks, strokes, eye problems, and kidney damage.
Your blood pressure rises and falls slightly throughout the day and night. But when
it stays above a certain level, it's called high blood pressure. High blood pressure
is also called hypertension.

Doctors measure blood pressure with two numbers:


The first number measures your blood pressure when your heart beats (this is called
systolic pressure).



The second number measures your blood pressure when your heart relaxes and fills with
blood (this is called diastolic pressure).



Your doctor will probably describe your blood pressure using these two numbers: for
example, '140 over 90'.

Usually, doctors will say you have high blood pressure if either your first number
is higher than 140 or your second number is higher than 90.

However, if you have kidney disease, your doctor will say you have high blood pressure
if either your first number is higher than 130 or your second number is higher than
80.

You are more likely to have high blood pressure if you:


are older


have a close relative with high blood pressure


have certain medical conditions (such as diabetes or sleep apnoea)


are black


are overweight


drink moderate to high amounts of alcohol, or


don’t exercise.


What are the symptoms?
Most people with high blood pressure don't get any symptoms. You can't feel when your
blood pressure goes up, although occasionally people with very high blood pressure
say they had bad headaches before they were treated.

The only way to find out if your blood pressure is high is to have it measured.
People usually find out they have high blood pressure after a routine blood pressure
check.

Your doctor will measure your blood pressure using an inflatable cuff that goes around
your upper arm. You’ll need to have your blood pressure measured on two or more occasions
to make sure it’s not just a one-off high reading. You should also have it measured
in both arms.

If your reading is high, your doctor may recommend that you measure your own blood
pressure at home.

Another option is to wear a device that measures your blood pressure several times
over the course of one day (this is called ambulatory blood pressure monitoring).

Blood pressure goes up and down during the day, so home and ambulatory monitoring
can help confirm whether your blood pressure is high.

Also, some people feel nervous when having their blood pressure taken by a doctor
or nurse, and this can lead to a temporarily raised blood pressure reading.

You might hear this called 'white coat hypertension', named after the white coats
that healthcare professionals sometimes wear.

What will happen to me?
The main health problems related to high blood pressure are heart attacks, strokes,
heart failure, eye problems, and kidney failure.

But not everybody with high blood pressure will get these problems. Your chance of
these problems depends on several things, including:



how high your blood pressure is


how long you've had high blood pressure


whether you have other health problems (such as high cholesterol or diabetes)


how closely you follow your doctor's treatment recommendations. This includes taking
your medicines as directed and making changes to your lifestyle.



The good news is that the harmful effects of high blood pressure don't happen overnight.
They usually take many years to develop. And if you control your high blood pressure
you can reduce the chance that they will ever happen.

Where to get more help
Many resources are available to provide advice and support for people with high blood
pressure. You can ask your doctor or nurse for recommendations.

In the UK, one resource is the Blood Pressure Association (bloodpressureuk.org).

If you've got herpes simplex eye infection it means your eye is infected with the
herpes simplex virus. The infection will probably go away in a couple of weeks. But
there's a chance it could cause more serious problems that might damage your eyesight.

You can use our information to talk to your doctor and decide which treatments are
best for you.

What is herpes simplex eye infection?
Many people carry the herpes simplex virus in their body. Usually it doesn't cause
problems. But if the virus infects your eye it can make it red and uncomfortable.
It can cause sight problems, but this is rare.

In most people herpes eye infection is caused by herpes simplex type 1. This is the
virus that causes cold sores on your lips. But it can be caused by herpes simplex
type 2. This virus usually causes genital herpes.

Herpes eye infection usually affects the front part of the eye, called the cornea.
The cornea is clear and less than 1 millimetre thick. It protects the rest of the
eye.

Usually the infection affects the top layer of the cornea (the epithelium). The infection
can damage the tissue and cause an ulcer. Sometimes the infection affects the middle
layer of the cornea (the stroma). This is more serious.

In some people the infection affects only the eyelid or the outside of the eye (the
conjunctiva).

What are the symptoms?
You might not get any symptoms, especially the first time you have herpes simplex
eye infection. But it's important to go to the doctor if you do have symptoms. These
can include:



a swollen eyelid


redness, pain, or discomfort in the eye


pain when looking into bright light


watering eyes


blurred eyesight.


If your doctor thinks that your symptoms are caused by herpes infection he or she
will probably refer you to a specialist eye doctor, called an ophthalmologist.

What treatments work?
The treatment you need will depend on which part of your cornea is affected. If you
have contact lenses you should not wear them until your eye has healed.

Medicines
To help with pain your doctor might recommend taking paracetamol, ibuprofen, or another
type of pain reliever. Your doctor might also prescribe eye drops to help with other
symptoms, such as pain when looking into bright light.

If your infection affects the top layer of the cornea (the epithelium), antiviral eye ointment should help your eye to heal.

Most people with herpes eye infection of the top layer of their cornea get better
in a couple of weeks, even without treatment. But your doctor will probably suggest
you have treatment to help your eye heal faster. Treatment can also stop the infection
spreading.

When you use antiviral eye ointment your eyes might water more than usual or feel
itchy and uncomfortable.

Some doctors wipe away the infected tissue from the cornea before starting treatment
with eye ointment. This is called debridement.

If you have an infection of the middle layer of the cornea (the stroma) antiviral tablets plus steroid eye drops work best to heal the eye.

The full name for these steroids is corticosteroids. They are similar to chemicals
your body makes naturally to fight inflammation (swelling). They are not the same
as the anabolic steroids used by some athletes and bodybuilders.

A side effect of steroid drops is that they can make the herpes virus infection more
likely to spread to the top layer of the cornea (the epithelium). So you might get
an ulcer there. You'll need to get your eye checked regularly while you're using these
eye drops.

Treatment to stop the infection coming back
If you get repeated infections you’re more likely to get damage to your eyesight.
So you might want to try treatments to stop the infection returning.

Taking antiviral tablets daily can help stop you getting another herpes eye infection. These tablets can't
get rid of the virus altogether, but they might stop repeated flare-ups of the infection.

What will happen to me?
Your infection will probably go away in a couple of weeks. But there's a small chance
it could scar your cornea, which can damage your eyesight. This is more likely if
you get repeated infections.

If your cornea has scarring that is affecting your vision, treatment can help. If
the scarring is mild you might be offered laser surgery.

If the scarring is more extensive you might need to have a corneal graft operation.
This involves cutting away the damaged part of your cornea and replacing it with a
piece of cornea from a donated eye. Your doctor will help you explore your options."

Hepatitis C is an infection that can harm your liver. Many people don't know they
have it, because you can go for many years without having any symptoms. Treatments
can get rid of the virus.

What happens when you have hepatitis C?
The virus that causes hepatitis C is carried in human blood. You can catch it if blood
from someone with the virus gets into your bloodstream and the virus is carried to
your liver.

Some people's bodies fight off the virus naturally, without any treatment. This happens
for between 15 and 45 in every 100 people who are infected with the virus. But many
people aren't able to fight off the virus on their own.

If you have had the infection for more than six months doctors say you have chronic hepatitis C. Some people live for many years with chronic hepatitis C without having any health
problems. But it can cause scarring in your liver (cirrhosis) and stop your liver
working properly.

If your liver isn't working properly, all the jobs that it does are affected. These
include:



breaking down waste products in your body


fighting infection, and


breaking food down into a form your cells can use for energy.


Up to 20 in every 100 people who have chronic hepatitis C eventually get cirrhosis if they don't have treatment. Over time, cirrhosis can cause life-threatening problems,
including liver cancer.

Should I have treatment - and when?
It's recommended that people with chronic hepatitis C have treatment unless they have
a short life expectancy - for example, if they have another serious condition that
could shorten their life.

If you have hepatitis C that isn't considered chronic you will want to discuss your
options with your doctor. Treatment for hepatitis C takes several months and can have
some unpleasant side effects. So it can sometimes be difficult to decide if, and when,
to have treatment.

Here are some of the things you need to think about. You can talk them over with your
doctor to decide what is best for you.

How old are you?
If you are younger than 18 or older than 60, the benefits of treatment may not be
as clear as they would be for someone at a different age.

For example, not much is known about the effects of hepatitis C medicines in children. And someone who is older might have other health issues that could make treatment
more difficult, or harmful. These are issues you should discuss with your doctor.


Is your liver damaged?
If you have hepatitis C, but you don't have any signs of liver damage, your doctor
may say you don't need treatment now. But you might get liver damage in the future.
You need to keep in touch with your doctor and have regular tests.

If you have mild liver damage there's a better chance that treatment will work than
if your liver damage is more serious. You need to weigh up the chance that liver damage
may get worse against the side effects of treatment.

If you have serious liver damage your doctor will probably suggest that you have treatment
as soon as you can.

Will you be able to cope with the side effects?
You may get unpleasant side effects during treatment, which can be difficult to cope
with. But this is less likely with newer medicines for hepatitis C (see below). It's
important that you fully understand the possible side effects, so you can weigh these
against the possible benefits of treatment.

What treatments work?
Medicines can help you get rid of the hepatitis C virus. This may stop any liver damage
from getting worse and prevent future damage.

Types of medicines
The main treatment for hepatitis C used to be a medicine called interferon. But it
is no longer recommended as there are several newer treatments that often work better than interferon, cause fewer side effects, and require a shorter
period of treatment.

Another advantage of the newer treatments is that you take them as tablets or capsules,
whereas interferon requires an injection.

The newer medicines are called direct-acting antivirals.

You take these medicines once or twice a day. You might take more than one of these
drugs at a time. Or you might take a tablet that is a combination of several drugs.
Treatment with these new tablets usually lasts between 8 and 12 weeks.

What treatments your doctor recommends depends on a few things.
What type of hepatitis C virus do you have?
There are six types of hepatitis C virus. They are called genotypes and are numbered
1 to 6. What genotype you have affects which medicines are most likely to work for
you. Most people with hepatitis C in Western Europe have genotype 1, 2, or 3. You
will have a blood test before you have treatment to find out which genotype you have.

Do you have certain medical conditions?
If you are pregnant, taking some of these medicines may harm your baby. Talk to your doctor about your
options. You may want to wait until after you've had your baby to start treatment.


If you have kidney disease, heart disease, or severe liver damage, you may not be able to take some of the medicines. That's because some of them might
make these conditions worse.

Have you been treated for hepatitis C before?
Treatment for hepatitis C doesn't always work. And sometimes it works for a while
and then the virus flares up again. If you have had treatment for hepatitis C before
you can have treatment again. But you might be offered different medicines.

What medicines are available where you live?
The newer medicines for hepatitis C have not yet all been approved in some countries.
You can talk to your doctor about what treatments are available where you live.

Medicine side effects
The newer treatments for hepatitis C can cause side effects but these are usually not serious. Side effects can include tiredness, problems sleeping,
a rash, itching, headaches, diarrhoea, and nausea.

The older hepatitis C medicines - peginterferon and ribavirin - sometimes cause more
serious side effects. Peginterferon is no longer recommended for treatment of hepatitis
C. But ribavirin is sometimes still used.

Common side effects of ribavirin are tiredness, feeling irritable, skin rashes, a
stuffy nose, and coughing. More serious side effects can include anaemia (having too
few red blood cells) and severe depression.

If your doctor suggests ribavirin as a treatment for you, he or she should discuss
the possible benefits and side effects with you.

If you take ribavirin your doctor should make sure that you have regular blood tests
to check for any problems.

Follow-up
The only way to see if treatment is working is to have blood tests to check for the
virus. If your test is positive you still have the virus in your blood. If your test
is negative you have no sign of the virus in your blood.

Most people have blood tests for the virus after four and 12 weeks of treatment. People
with genotype 3 have an additional test after 24 weeks. If there is no sign the medicines
are working your doctor will probably advise you to stop taking them.

The virus can come back after you have finished treatment. To be certain that the
treatment has worked, doctors test for the virus again six months after you finish
treatment. If there is no sign of the virus doctors say you have a sustained virological
response (SVR for short).

You will also have tests to check how well your liver and kidneys are working.
Among people with the most common genotypes (1, 2, and 3), those with genotype 1 used
to have a much smaller chance than people with genotype 2 or 3 of getting rid of the
virus through treatment. But the newer treatments have changed this. Now, most people
have no sign of the virus six months after they finish treatment."

Hepatitis C is an infection that can harm your liver. Many people don't know they
have it, because you can have it for many years without any symptoms. If you have
hepatitis C you'll want to know what that means for you.

This leaflet gives you basic information about the infection and what might happen.
What is hepatitis C?
Hepatitis C is an infection caused by a virus that is carried in human blood. You
can catch it if blood from someone with the virus gets into your bloodstream.

In many people the body fights off the virus naturally, without any treatment. This
happens for between 15 and 45 in every 100 people infected with the virus.

But many people aren't able to fight off the infection on their own. If you have had
the infection for more than six months doctors say you have chronic hepatitis C (chronic means long-lasting).

There are six types of hepatitis C virus. They have different genes. Doctors call
the types genotypes, and they are numbered 1 to 6.

Most people with hepatitis C in Western Europe have genotype 1, 2, or 3. You will
have a blood test to find out what type you have.

Ask your doctor: what genotype of hepatitis C do I have?
How did I get hepatitis C?
It can be a shock to find out that you have hepatitis C. You may wonder how you caught
the virus. Some people never find out how it happened.



Most people who have hepatitis C got the virus by sharing needles to inject illegal
drugs.



Before 1991 some people were also infected through blood transfusions. Since then,
blood that's used for transfusions has been screened for hepatitis C.



Sometimes doctors and nurses get hepatitis C by being accidentally poked by an infected
needle (for example, when giving injections to patients with hepatitis C).



Some babies are born with hepatitis C because their mothers have the virus.


There is a small chance that you can get hepatitis C if you have sex with someone
who is infected and you don't use a condom (unprotected sex).



You can get it from sharing toothbrushes or razors with someone who is infected.


You can't catch hepatitis by kissing, cuddling, or holding hands. And you can't get
it by sharing household items like plates or knives and forks.

Ask your doctor: how can I avoid passing hepatitis C to anyone else?
What are the symptoms?
People who are infected with hepatitis C might get mild symptoms, such as feeling
tired, or they might not get any symptoms at all. And the symptoms can come and go.

Many people who have hepatitis C don't get any symptoms for many years. And they may
not get all of them.

These are the main symptoms of hepatitis C. You are more likely to get them if you've
had hepatitis C for a long time and it has affected your liver. These symptoms are:



yellow colour to your skin and the whites of your eyes. This is called jaundice


tiredness


dark-coloured urine


pain in the upper right side of your abdomen


losing your appetite and losing weight


feeling sick.


If the hepatitis C virus keeps damaging your liver over a long time you might get
more serious symptoms.

Up to 20 in every 100 people who are infected with hepatitis C eventually get scarring
in their liver (cirrhosis) if they don't have treatment. Cirrhosis tends to get worse
over time. And it can stop your liver working properly.

The symptoms of cirrhosis include:


a swollen liver, which may make your abdomen feel sore and bloated


weak muscles


swollen ankles


bloating in your abdomen


itchy skin.


Ask your doctor: what should I do if I start getting symptoms, or my symptoms get
worse?

How is hepatitis C diagnosed?
If you are concerned that you might have hepatitis C your doctor will ask you questions
to see if you are at risk and examine you for any signs of liver damage.

Your doctor might also check you for hepatitis C if a routine blood test suggests
your liver isn't working as well as it should.

The only way to find out for sure whether you have hepatitis C is to have a blood test for the virus. If your blood test is positive, that means you have the virus in your
blood. But the test doesn't tell you if the virus has affected your liver or how long
you have had it for.

If you have the virus your doctor will do additional blood tests to see if your liver
has been affected. These are sometimes called liver function tests. You might also hear them called an alanine aminotransferase test (ALT test for short)
and an aspartate aminotransferase test (AST test for short).

Your doctor may also suggest that you have a small piece of your liver taken out and
checked under a microscope. This is called a liver biopsy. It will show if the virus has damaged your liver.

The results may help you decide whether to have treatment straight away, or whether
to wait and see what happens to your liver.

Ask your doctor: what tests might I need?
What can I do to stay healthy?
If you have hepatitis C you can do some things to try to keep your liver as healthy
as possible.

You should avoid drinking alcohol. Even small amounts of alcohol might harm your liver.

You don't need to eat in a special way. But try to keep to a healthy weight. You should
eat sensibly and stick to healthy foods. And you should take regular exercise.

Your doctor might recommend that you have vaccines to protect you from the hepatitis
A and hepatitis B viruses. If you are infected with these viruses as well as hepatitis
C this can speed up the damage to your liver.

Ask your doctor: should I have the hepatitis A and B vaccines?
What will happen to me?
Among people with the most common genotypes (1, 2, and 3), those with genotype 1 used
to have a much smaller chance of getting rid of the virus through treatment than people
with genotype 2 or 3.

But newer treatments have changed this. Now, most people have no sign of the virus
six months after they finish treatment.

It's hard to say what will happen to you if you don't have treatment. Many people
live with the hepatitis C virus in their bodies for many years and don't have any
health problems. But other people get liver damage (cirrhosis).

Cirrhosis can cause serious problems with your liver, including liver cancer. If these
things happen to you, you might need a liver transplant.

It's a big operation, and donated livers aren't always available. But it can save
your life if your liver is badly damaged.

Hepatitis B is an infection with a virus that attacks your liver. It is not always
serious. But sometimes it can lead to a long-term illness, which can be serious or
even fatal. You can avoid getting hepatitis B by getting vaccinated against it.

What is hepatitis B?
Hepatitis B is an infection caused by the hepatitis B virus. The virus attacks the
liver. The infection can vary greatly in severity: it can be so mild that you don't
even know you have it, and it clears up without treatment; or it can cause serious
problems and even death.

Many people with hepatitis B don't get any symptoms. If you do get symptoms, these
are some of the most common:



Feeling tired


Losing your appetite


Getting aches and pains


Feeling sick


Vomiting


A rash


Tenderness in your liver


Having urine that is darker than usual


Getting a yellowish tint to your skin and whites of your eyes. This is called jaundice.


The hepatitis B virus is carried in the body fluids of people who are infected. You
can catch the virus if blood or another body fluid from a person who is infected gets
into your body.

Many people with hepatitis B get the infection by having sex with someone with the
virus, or by sharing needles to inject illegal drugs. A pregnant woman who is infected
can pass the hepatitis B virus on to her baby.

Even if you don't feel ill you can still pass the virus on to other people if you
are infected. Some people become long-term carriers of the illness (called 'chronic
carriers') but don't become ill themselves.

Is it serious?
Most people recover from hepatitis B without treatment. But in a few people it becomes
a serious illness that lasts a long time.

If this happens, hepatitis B can make your liver swell and stop working properly.
Later, you could get liver cancer or a liver disease called cirrhosis.

Babies and children are more likely to have the serious form of the illness.
Should I have the vaccine?
If you are at risk of catching hepatitis B you may want to consider having a vaccine
to prevent it. You are at higher risk if you are:



travelling to or living in parts of the world where hepatitis B is common (including
parts of Southeast Asia, most of the Pacific, sub-Saharan Africa, the Amazon, parts
of the Middle East, Central Asia, and some countries in Eastern Europe)



an injecting drug user, especially if you share needles with other people


a sexual partner or child of an injecting drug user, or of someone with hepatitis
B



someone who changes sexual partners frequently, especially if they have unprotected
sex



a man who has unprotected sex with men. Having anal sex puts you at greater risk of
getting hepatitis B



sharing a house with someone who has hepatitis B


working in a job that increases your chance of coming into contact with the virus:
for example, if you work as a healthcare professional.



If you fall into any of these categories you should consider getting the vaccine.
Doctors sometimes recommend that people get the vaccine if they are pregnant or have
certain health problems, such as diabetes or HIV. Doctors also recommend the vaccine
for people who are having dialysis for kidney failure.

What is it and how is it given?
Many countries now recommend hepatitis B vaccination for all new babies. For example,
in the UK, all babies born after 1 August 2017 have the hepatitis B vaccine as part
of their course of vaccinations.

Vaccines for hepatitis B are made with a tiny, harmless part of the virus that cannot
make you ill. After you have the vaccine your body makes antibodies against the hepatitis
B virus.

These antibodies protect you from being infected with the virus. So if you come into
contact with the virus in the future your body fights it off.

Adults and older children have the injection in the upper arm. Babies have it in the
thigh. You need more than one injection for the vaccine to work properly. Most people
have three injections - the first two injections one month apart and the third six
months later.

If you are pregnant and have hepatitis B or are a chronic carrier (you carry the virus
in your blood but do not feel ill) your baby will be given the vaccine when he or
she is born. They will be given one injection soon after birth and further injections
when they are 1 month, 2 months, and 12 months old.

Does it work?
There's good evidence that the vaccine protects people against getting hepatitis B.
It seems to work for people at any age, including newborn babies, older children,
and adults.

Can it be harmful?
The hepatitis B vaccine has been linked to some mild side effects. It might make your
arm sore. A very few people feel dizzy or faint or get a skin rash after the injection.
But serious reactions to the hepatitis B vaccine are very rare.

What are the alternatives?
There are ways to reduce your chances of getting hepatitis B. You could:


avoid having unprotected sex with people who are infected, and use a condom if you
are unsure



if you are a drug user avoid sharing needles with other drug users


avoid sharing household items, such as razor blades and toothbrushes, with infected
people



make sure the needles are sterile if you are having acupuncture, a tattoo, or body
piercing.



If you think you may have been infected you may be offered a different type of injection
called immunoglobulin. This treatment stops the virus spreading to uninfected cells
in the body.

It works best if you have the injection within 24 hours of coming into contact with
the virus. Immunoglobulin does not give you long-term protection against hepatitis
B.

You should consider seeing a doctor to have this injection if you:


have had a needlestick injury


have shared a needle with someone who has or could have hepatitis B


have had unprotected sex with someone who has or could have hepatitis B."

Heel pain can be uncomfortable and make it hard to walk. But it usually gets better
on its own with time. Trying certain exercises and treatments might help relieve the
pain until it clears up on its own.

We've brought together the best and most up-to-date research about heel pain to see
what treatments work. You can use our information to talk to your doctor and decide
which treatments are best for you.

What happens?
This information is about a type of heel pain that gives you soreness or tenderness
on the bottom of your heel and the sole of your foot. Doctors call this plantar fasciitis.

The plantar fascia is a band of tissue that stretches from your heel to the ball of your foot. A pad
of fat in your heel, over the plantar fascia, helps absorb the shock when you walk.

Most heel pain of this type happens in people over 40 years old. This might be because
the plantar fascia doesn’t stretch so well as people get older.

The fat pad on the heel may also get thinner as you age and not absorb so much of
the shock as you walk. You might also get a spur of bone growing where the plantar
fascia joins your heel bone. This can make your heel painful.

But doctors aren't really sure why some people get this pain. Some doctors think that
heel pain can be caused by standing for long periods on hard surfaces, or that it
might be more common in people who are overweight or who do a lot of running. But
no one really knows what causes it.

What are the symptoms?
Heel pain can feel sharp, like a knife sticking in the bottom of your foot.
The pain is usually worst first thing in the morning when you take the first few steps
after getting up, and when you first stand up after resting. After standing for a
while the pain may become more like a dull ache.

This type of heel pain causes soreness and tenderness only on the bottom of your foot.
You don't usually feel a pain on the back of your heel. The pain often spreads from
the centre of your heel and continues along the sole of your foot. The inside of the
arch of your foot may ache.

Heel pain may just be an irritation that you notice when you first stand up. Or the
pain can be bad enough to stop you walking.

What treatments work?
The pain in your heel should go away by itself with time, but it might take several
months. But if it is very bad or is taking a long time to get better you can talk
with your doctor about treatment.

In the meantime there are many things you or your doctor can try that might help.
Things to try first
Rest
It might sound obvious, but the first thing to try is to rest your foot as much as
possible. Many people find that this helps reduce their pain.

If you want to stay active while resting your foot you could try sport or activities
that don't involve putting too much weight on your foot, such as cycling and swimming.

Supports for your feet
There are several types of support that can help reduce heel pain. These range from
simple insoles and heel pads that you can buy from a pharmacy to custom-made shoes. But there isn't much good
research on how well they work. You may have to try several methods and see which
works for you.

Another method of supporting the foot involves taping the foot to give support to the arch. The idea is to strap up the foot, a little like bandaging,
to give support and reduce how much the foot moves and flattens when walking. Your
doctor will be able to tape your foot properly and show you how to do it yourself.

Stretching the plantar fascia might reduce heel pain. There are various ways to stretch this part of the foot.
Your doctor or physiotherapist can show you how to do it.

Some people try over-the-counter anti-inflammatory painkillers such ibuprofen for heel pain. But research suggests they don't have much effect.

Ice packs, used for up to 20 minutes at a time, can help reduce pain in the short term. Ice
should always be wrapped in a thin cloth before being used for pain relief. Ice should
never be put directly onto the skin for any length of time.

More-severe heel pain
If your pain is very bad and you find that resting, stretching, and supporting your
foot don't help, you can ask your doctor about other treatments for heel pain.

He or she might suggest a pain-killing injection or might refer you to another therapist
for treatments such as ultrasound or deep tissue massage. Ultrasound is a type of scan done using a hand-held scanning device. The idea is
that it sends sound waves into the tissue that can help to block pain signals. But
there isn't much good evidence that it works.

Night splints hold the foot steady in one place while you sleep. If you use this treatment you
will need to wear the splint for at least six hours a night for about eight weeks.
Some people find that this helps reduce pain. But some people find them too uncomfortable
to wear while sleeping.

Steroid injections (the full name is corticosteroids) can help reduce heel pain in the short term. These
steroids are not the same as the anabolic steroids that some body builders use, but
are similar to anti-inflammatory substances that occur naturally in the body.

Steroid injections can cause side effects in some people, including damage to the
tissue of the foot.

If your pain is severe your doctor might suggest putting your foot in a cast, in the
same way as if you had a broken bone. This treatment works well in many people. But
you may not want to go as far as having your foot in a full cast.

Heel pain that doesn't improve with usual treatments
For people with the most severe pain that doesn't improve with other treatments, one
option is extracorporeal shock wave therapy, or ESWT for short. With this treatment a therapist uses a device to send short energy waves
into the painful tissue.

The device is placed on top of the skin ('extracorporeal' means outside the body)
in the same way as an ultrasound device. Research suggests that it helps some people
with severe heel pain. This treatment might be done in a hospital or outpatient clinic.
You might need to have several sessions.

ESWT can cause mild pain. It can also cause bruising and numbness for a few days after
treatment. In rare cases it can cause more serious damage to tissue.

Some people have surgery to release nerves that are trapped or compressed. But this is only suggested as a
last resort for severe heel pain that doesn't improve with other treatments. It seems
to work well for many people but, as with all types of surgery, there are risks. In
particular surgery for heel pain can sometimes cause nerve damage.

What will happen to me?
Your heel pain should eventually get better by itself - especially if you rest your
foot when possible and don't do anything that risks making the pain worse. And heel
pain doesn't usually come back once it has gone.

The treatments listed above might help relieve the symptoms while you wait for the
problem to clear up. But it may take several months for you to get back to normal.
Some people have heel pain that lasts up to a year and a half."

Heavy periods are menstrual periods that last longer than they should or where there
is more bleeding than is usual. They are not usually a sign of anything serious. They
can disrupt your life and make you feel miserable but there are treatments that can
help.

We’ve looked at the best and most up-to-date research to produce this information.
You can use it to talk to your doctor and decide which treatments are right for you.

Do you find heavy periods a problem?
You may find it hard to judge whether your periods are heavy. Even talking to friends
about it may not help. Women often have different ideas about what it means to have
heavy periods.

Doctors say that you have heavy menstrual bleeding if you have excessive blood loss
during your periods that interferes with your quality of life. This can mean your
social, emotional, or work life.

Here's a list of things that might help you judge whether you have heavy periods.




You use more than nine pads or tampons (or both pads and tampons) on your heaviest
days.



You have to wear both a tampon and a pad (double protection).


Your period lasts more than six days.


You have to get up at night to change your protection.


You pass clots of blood.


You stain your bedding or clothes despite wearing tampons and pads.


You stay at home during your period because you are worried about having an 'accident'.




You feel tired, especially during your period. This could mean your body is low in
iron. This is caused by a type of anaemia called iron-deficiency anaemia. It happens
when your body is not able to make enough new red blood cells to make up for blood
you lost during your period.

Your doctor can find out if you have anaemia by testing a sample of your blood. If
your red cell count is low you may need treatment, such as iron tablets, to help you
make more red cells.



Some women have heavy periods all the time, while others have them only at certain
times in their lives. For example, during puberty or in the year or so before the
menopause.

If you're approaching the menopause you may not want to do anything about your heavy
bleeding because you know your periods will stop soon. But if your periods are heavy
for more than a few months and they're making your life miserable, you may want to
get help from your doctor.

What causes unusual vaginal bleeding?
Many women have heavy menstrual bleeding that doesn't have any obvious cause and that
doesn't cause them any major problems.

But unusual vaginal bleeding, including sudden changes to your periods, could be caused
by another medical condition that needs treatment. So it's always important to see
your doctor if you have unusual vaginal bleeding: for example, if you bleed after
sex or between your periods, or if your periods suddenly become heavier.

Tests
Your doctor might be able to get a good idea of what might be causing your symptoms
just by asking you about them. For example, he or she will ask you the age at which
you started having periods, and how regular they have been since they began.

They may also ask about other things, including whether you have had any sudden weight
loss or weight gain, and if you get tired very easily. And they might suggest a physical
examination.

Your doctor might also want to do one or more tests, such as:


A pregnancy test. It's possible to be pregnant without knowing it. And, even though
menstrual periods stop during pregnancy, unusual bleeding can occur. Some women may
also have an ectopic pregnancy. This is when a fertilised egg develops outside the
uterus (womb).



A blood test. This can show whether you have a hormonal imbalance, or if you have
anaemia.



A hysteroscopy. This involves looking inside the womb with a camera.


A biopsy. This involves taking a sample of tissue for testing.


An ultrasound scan. This is the same type of scan that a pregnant woman has to check
on her growing baby's progress. It can also spot signs of some conditions that can
cause unusual bleeding.



These are some of the conditions that can cause heavy menstrual bleeding or unusual
vaginal bleeding:

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)
If you have PCOS your hormones are not in balance. The hormones made by your ovaries
are the ones most affected. Among other things these hormones affect your periods.

Fibroids
Fibroids are lumps that grow in the womb. But they don't usually cause any problems.
They’re not cancer and they’re very common. Most women with fibroids have no symptoms.
But in some women they can cause problems, including heavy periods.

Miscarriage
Most miscarriages happen during the first 12 weeks. of pregnancy. One of the symptoms
of a miscarriage is vaginal bleeding. If you have bleeding while pregnant you should
get medical help straight away.

Endometritis
Endometritis is inflammation (swelling) of the lining of the womb (uterus). It's usually
caused by an infection. It can happen when there are major changes that affect the
uterus: for example, after giving birth, having a miscarriage, or having some types
of medical procedure or surgery.

One of the symptoms of endometritis is vaginal bleeding. If it's not treated it can
cause serious complications, including sepsis (an infection in the blood).

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)
PID is an infection in your reproductive organs, usually transmitted during sex, which
causes inflammation. These organs include your womb, ovaries, and fallopian tubes.
One of the symptoms is unusual vaginal bleeding.

Dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB)
DUB is prolonged or frequent bleeding from the uterus that isn't connected to pregnancy
or an infection. It is thought to be caused by an imbalance of hormones in the ovaries.

Endometrial polyps
These are non-cancerous growths in the lining of the uterus, which can cause unusual
bleeding.

Other causes of vaginal bleeding can include cervical cancer, ectopic pregnancy, and kidney or liver problems. These
are less common causes of vaginal bleeding than those listed above. But it's important
to see your doctor if you are concerned about any issues around your periods or vaginal
bleeding - even just for your peace of mind.

What treatments work?
If you have heavy periods that are not caused by another medical condition it doesn't
mean you have to put up with it. There are treatments that can help make your periods
lighter.

Your doctor may suggest one of the following treatments to help reduce your bleeding.
You can discuss with your doctor which treatment might suit you best. If the first
treatment you try doesn’t help, you may be able to try another.

Drug treatments


A medicine called tranexamic acid can help women have lighter bleeding. But some women
have side effects with this medicine, including leg cramps and feeling sick.



Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may help if your periods are painful
as well as heavy. People who have heart problems should not take an NSAID called diclofenac.




Some women have a contraceptive coil fitted that gradually releases the hormone progestogen
into their womb. This treatment reduces bleeding for most women. For some women, this
coil stops their periods completely after about 12 months. You may have heard this
called an IUD (intrauterine device). It is a contraceptive, so you probably won’t
be able to get pregnant if you have one fitted.

You might bleed slightly more during the first few months after you have this coil
fitted and you might bleed between periods. You may also feel bloated and have tender
breasts.



The combined contraceptive pill contains the hormones oestrogen and progestogen. This
can help regulate your periods and reduce bleeding.



Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues are drugs that can reduce bleeding.
But they can cause side effects similar to symptoms of the menopause, as well as weaker
bones in some women.



Progestogen tablets aren’t normally used for heavy periods. But they may be prescribed
if you’re having a very heavy or long period, or to prevent bleeding. Progestogen
is the hormone contained in the progestogen-only pill (also called the mini-pill),
which is used as a contraceptive. Progestogen tablets can cause side effects in some
women, including headaches, breast tenderness, stomach upsets, tiredness, and bloating.



Surgical treatments
Surgery isn't usually recommended for heavy periods that aren't caused by another
condition. But if your symptoms don't get better with other treatments and your quality
of life is badly affected, there are options.



Dilatation and curettage (D&C) is a procedure to remove some of the lining of your womb. This can make your periods
lighter. Some women's periods stop altogether after this procedure. The operation
is done through the vagina, so you won't need to be cut or have stitches.



If you have fibroids, having an operation to remove them (called a myomectomy) might make your periods lighter. This operation can be done through a cut in the
abdomen or through the vagina."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/3000251/Heat%20stroke,Heat stroke,"Heat stroke Last published: Nov 19, 2021
Heat stroke is a medical emergency that happens when someone’s body temperature becomes
dangerously high. This can cause organ damage and sometimes death.

Heat stroke often affects older people during the summer months. If you think that
someone is suffering from heat stroke, call an ambulance right away.

What is heat stroke?
Heat stroke is when someone’s body temperature becomes dangerously high. It is a medical emergency that needs immediate treatment.

Doctors say that a dangerously high temperature is above 40°C (104°F).

Most of us suffer from the effects of extreme heat at some time, either in hot weather
or if we exercise hard in a warm environment. If we get so hot that it causes physical
symptoms, this is called heat illness.

Mild heat illness can cause symptoms such as swelling and muscle cramps. But it’s
not always dangerous, and we usually just need to take simple steps to cool down.

But if someone becomes overheated and doesn’t manage to cool down, their condition
can get worse. It can then become what doctors call heat stroke. This is the most dangerous type of heat illness.

Without treatment, heat stroke can stop the body’s main organs, including the lungs,
kidneys, and liver from working properly. It can even cause them to fail completely,
which can cause death.

Causes of heat stroke
A common cause of heat stroke is long spells of hot weather, or heat waves, during the summer months. Hot weather can be especially dangerous for older people, whose bodies are not able to cool themselves as well as younger people’s.

People living in urban areas seem to be more at risk during hot weather, as densely built-up towns and cities
can trap heat so that it can’t disperse.

As well as being older, other things that make someone more likely to suffer from
heat stroke include:



high-intensity exercise in hot or humid conditions



being in poor physical condition. This makes it harder for your body’s systems to
cool down



having what doctors call impaired cognition. This could mean being affected by certain mental health conditions or by dementia.
Or it could just mean mentally slowing down a little as we get older. These things
can stop people from spotting the signs of overheating



needing help taking care of yourself


certain medicines. These include diuretics, antidepressants, and antihistamines among
others



having certain medical conditions, including diabetes and heart disease


not being used to local weather conditions (called being acclimatised). For example, if you travel to a hot and humid country and you’re not used to that
kind of climate, you might need to take things easy for a few days



being dehydrated


being unable to take a break when working in hot conditions, and


being unable to find shelter or shade in hot conditions.


What are the symptoms?
The symptoms of heat stroke can include:


an altered mental state. This can vary from being confused to losing consciousness
(blacking out)



being agitated and irritable


being slow and lethargic


seizures


problems with balance, speech, and coordination


headache


anxiety


dizziness


weakness, and


nausea and vomiting.


What treatments work?
As you would expect, the main treatment for someone suffering from heat stroke is
to reduce their body temperature to a safe level as quickly as possible.

But the medical staff will be careful not to reduce someone’s temperature by too much,
because being too cold can be dangerous.

Doctors also need to check that someone’s organs are working properly, and to do what
they can to get them working normally if they’re not. This will probably mean doing
some tests, such as blood tests.

Reducing body temperature quickly is ideally done by placing the person into cold water. If someone is being treated in a place where it’s not possible to do this, doctors
can use ice packs.

Doctors will probably also use ice packs when it’s not safe or wise to immerse someone
in cold water. For example, ice would be used if someone:



is not conscious


is not cooperating with treatment - perhaps because they are panicking


has heart problems, or


is dehydrated and needs immediate fluids into a vein before any other treatments.


As well as treatments to reduce body temperature, someone with heat stroke might also
be given:



oxygen to breathe, and


intravenous fluids - this means being given fluids directly into a vein. This gets
a mixture of water, salt, and sugar into the body as quickly as possible.



If someone needs emergency treatment for heat stroke before they can be taken to hospital,
there are things that can help to cool them down quickly, such as:



taking them to a cooler place


removing excess clothing


fanning the skin, and


wetting and cooling the skin with cool-water towels and ice packs, if possible.


But these things should only be done if it’s clear that their symptoms are being caused
by heat and not something else.

Preventing problems with heat
We can’t do anything about the weather, and heat waves are becoming more common in
many parts of the world.

But there are things we can do to help prevent problems, especially when we know warm
weather is coming. For example, people who are more likely to have problems in the
heat, such as older people, can:



make sure they stay hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids. But avoid alcohol. Alcohol causes dehydration



stay in a cool place, if possible, and


wear loose, light clothing.


What to expect in the future?
Heat stroke can continue to cause dangerous inflammation (swelling) in the body’s
tissues for some time after the initial problem. So you should avoid warm conditions
for a couple of days after even a mild bout of heat illness.

Having heat stroke once means that you have an increased chance of having it again.
So you might want to be careful when in warm conditions in the future.

If you have had medical treatment for heat stroke, you should:


avoid exercise for at least seven days


exercise in a cool environment when you start exercising again


exercise gently at first, and gradually increase exercise to your normal level over
about two weeks.



Most people recover well from heat stroke, but it can cause death. This is more likely
in older people, whose organs are not able to withstand the damage from heat stroke
as well as younger people’s.

About 5 in 100 young healthy people with severe heat stroke will die from it. But
about half of older people with severe heat stroke will not survive.

Some people have long-term complications because of organ damage caused by heat stroke.
For example, heat stroke can cause problems with the liver, kidneys, or lungs.

You are more likely to make a good recovery if you get treatment quickly and are in
fairly good general health."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1183729920705/Heartburn,Heartburn,"Heartburn Last published: Dec 06, 2021
Most people get heartburn from time to time. But some people get heartburn a lot,
which can be very unpleasant. Fortunately, there are treatments that can help to control
it.

What is heartburn?
Your stomach contains acid that helps you to digest the food you eat. It's possible
for some of this acid to splash up into the tube that carries food from your mouth
to your stomach (your oesophagus). The acid may reach your throat, mouth, or lungs.
This acid causes the feeling of heartburn.

Some people have a problem in their oesophagus that means they get heartburn easily.
A ring of muscle at the end of your oesophagus usually closes off the top of your
stomach and keeps the acid in place.

If this muscle doesn't work properly, you're more likely to get heartburn. Your doctor
may say you have gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, or GORD for short.

What are the symptoms?
You probably know what heartburn feels like. You get an uncomfortable burning feeling
that usually starts in your chest, and moves up towards your throat. You may also
get a sour or bitter taste in your mouth. Other, less common symptoms include:



bad breath


hoarseness, and


a dry cough.


If you get heartburn regularly it can damage your oesophagus.
Heartburn can sometimes be a sign of a more serious illness. If you have black stools
or you are vomiting blood, you should call your doctor as soon as possible or seek
emergency treatment. You could have bleeding in your stomach or your bowel. If you're
worried about a pain in your chest, you should also get help urgently.

You should also tell your doctor if you get a feeling that food sticks in your throat
when you swallow, if you lose weight without trying, or if you feel tired for no reason.

Your doctor may suggest some tests, such as an endoscopy, just to be safe. During
an endoscopy, a doctor uses a long tube with a camera on the end to look inside your
oesophagus.

What treatments work?
Lifestyle changes
Studies suggest that some things increase your chance of getting heartburn, including
smoking, being overweight, and drinking a lot of alcohol or caffeine.

Some people find that stopping smoking, losing weight, or cutting out alcohol or caffeine
make a difference.

You could also look at how healthy your diet is overall. For example, eating more
fresh fruit and vegetables and fewer processed foods might help.

If you get heartburn at night, you might try raising the head of your bed, so that
your head is higher than your feet. Some people say that it helps. You might also
avoid eating late at night.

Medicines
If you get heartburn only sometimes
Over-the-counter medicines called antacids may be the only treatment you need if you get heartburn only occasionally. Antacids
usually come as tablets that you chew or as liquids.

Antacids can sometimes cause side effects, such as wind and constipation.
They can also interfere with how your body absorbs some medicines, especially if you
take the antacid at the same time as the medicine. Your doctor or pharmacist can give
you advice about how to take your medicines.

If you get heartburn frequently
If you get heartburn two or more times a week, you should see your doctor.
Your doctor will probably recommend taking a medicine called a proton pump inhibitor. This is the best type of medicine for frequent heartburn. Proton pump inhibitors
work by reducing the amount of acid in your stomach.

You can buy a low-dose proton pump inhibitor called omeprazole over the counter. But
many people need higher doses, which are available only on prescription.

Proton pump inhibitors are effective at reducing and even stopping heartburn. If acid
has damaged your oesophagus, these drugs can help it heal.

Most people continue to take a proton pump inhibitor over the long term. If they stop,
their heartburn usually comes back. However, you may be able to stop taking the medicine,
especially if lifestyle changes make a difference. Your doctor will review your need
for ongoing treatment from time to time.

Side effects with proton pump inhibitors aren't common, although some people:


feel nauseous


have diarrhoea or constipation


have headaches, or


get a rash.


Serious side effects are rare. But research suggests that using them for a long time
can increase your chance of bone fractures.

Some proton pump inhibitors can affect how well other medications work. You should
tell your doctor if you are taking:



the blood-thinning drugs warfarin or clopidogrel


a heart drug called digoxin, or


an epilepsy drug called phenytoin.


Taking proton pump inhibitors can also reduce the amount of magnesium in your blood.
Your doctor might check your magnesium level from time to time, especially if you
are taking these medicines over the long term.

If you can't take a proton pump inhibitor (for example, if you get side effects),
your doctor may prescribe a medicine called an H2 blocker. H2 blockers reduce the amount of acid in your stomach, but they don't work as well
as proton pump inhibitors.

Your doctor might also prescribe an H2 blocker as an extra treatment if you are taking
a proton pump inhibitor and still get heartburn at night.

H2 blockers don't usually cause serious side effects. A few people get headaches or
diarrhoea. However, sometimes the drugs stop working after people have taken them
for a while.

Surgery
Most people with frequent heartburn take proton pump inhibitors over the long term
to control their symptoms. However, some people would rather not take these medicines
regularly, perhaps because they get side effects or have a hard time remembering to
take their tablets. For these people, a surgery called fundoplication may be an option.


This operation involves strengthening the ring of muscle in the oesophagus that closes
off the top of the stomach. This stops the stomach acid from reaching the oesophagus.

But, like all operations, fundoplication has risks. Possible problems include blood
clots, bleeding, and infection.

What will happen to me?
If you get only mild heartburn, you'll probably just need to take antacids from time
to time. And your heartburn may go away on its own.

If you get heartburn a lot, your doctor will probably recommend regular treatment
with a proton pump inhibitor. This works well for most people.

If you have frequent heartburn and don't get treatment, you might be more likely to
have other problems. For example, the inside of your oesophagus may become sore and
inflamed. It could become narrow, which can make swallowing difficult. You could also
get sores (called ulcers) and patches of bleeding. However, these problems are rare."

It can be frightening to hear your doctor talk about heart failure. It is a serious
condition, but it doesn't mean that your heart is about to stop working or that you're
about to die.

There are good treatments that can help, and many people live with heart failure for
many years. There are lots of things you can do to look after yourself and stay well.

What can I do?
If you have heart failure, there are lots of things you can do to feel better, stay
healthier, and stay out of hospital. You might like to ask a friend or family member
to help you with some of these things.

Make sure you take your tablets
For people with heart failure, one of the most common causes of ending up in hospital
is not taking their medicine. That's understandable, when you have lots of pills to
remember.

If you have problems taking your medicine, talk to your doctor. He or she may be able
to give you long-acting tablets that you don't need to take as often. You may be able
to switch to another medicine or a lower dose, if you are getting side effects.

It can be easier to remember your tablets if you take them at the same time each day.
You could make a timetable of what you need to take and when.

You can get pill boxes with separate compartments for the medicines you need to take
at different times. Your pharmacist can make up a weekly pill pack for you.

If you have other conditions such as diabetes or high blood pressure, you will also
need to follow your doctor's advice about those. That will probably include taking
other medicines.

Stop smoking
If you smoke, one of the most important things you can do is stop. Stopping will mean
you feel less short of breath and will make you healthier overall. It may also help
prevent coughs and chest infections which can make your heart failure worse.

It's easier to stop smoking if you get help from a doctor. Talk to your doctor about
whether treatments like nicotine replacement patches can help you.

There are also medicines to help people stop smoking. These treatments aren't suitable
for everyone. Talk to your doctor about whether they are right for you.

Weigh yourself regularly
Heart failure can cause your body to hold on to too much water. The easiest way to
check for this is to weigh yourself every day.

If you put on more than 2 kilograms (4 pounds) in three days or less, it may be because
there's too much water in your body. If you do notice sudden weight gain, talk to
your doctor. He or she may need to alter your medicine.

Cut down on salt
Salt encourages your body to hold on to water. This can be harmful if you have heart
failure. You may need to cut your salt to a maximum of 2g to 3g a day (about half
a teaspoon).

Food without salt can seem to have less taste until you get used to it. Try onions,
garlic, ginger, chilli, herbs, lemon, vinegar, or black pepper to add flavour without
using salt.

There's a lot of salt in processed and convenience foods, such as breakfast cereals,
tinned foods, stock cubes, ready meals, fast food, and biscuits. Cutting these out
can help a lot.

Talk to your doctor before you try 'low salt' substitutes. They usually contain potassium
instead of normal salt, which contains sodium. Some drugs for heart failure affect
the amount of potassium in your body, and getting too much can be harmful.

Get your flu and pneumonia vaccines
Flu and pneumonia are more dangerous for people with heart failure. Your doctor will
probably recommend you get vaccinated against these diseases.

You have these vaccines as injections. You'll need a new flu vaccine every year, but
you'll usually need the pneumonia vaccine only once.

Take your doctor's advice about drinking alcohol
Some people with heart failure can drink alcohol in moderation (within recommended
limits). But if your doctor has told you that your heart failure was caused by alcohol,
it's better not to drink at all. Ask your doctor what's best for you.

Lose weight if you need to
Losing weight if you need to can reduce the strain on your heart. Your doctor, nurse,
or dietitian can give you advice on losing weight with a healthy diet.

The main thing is to choose a diet that you can stick to. Many people find it easier
to lose weight if they join a group and have other people for support.

Exercise
You may worry that exercise could put a strain on your heart. But exercise can help
you feel better, be less breathless, and live longer.

Your doctor may suggest an exercise programme. Even simple things, like going for
a walk every day, can make a difference. Your doctor or nurse can give you advice
about how to exercise safely.

Can I live a normal life?
You may have to make some changes to your routine. You should be able to keep active,
see friends and family, and keep up the hobbies you enjoy most of the time. If your
symptoms are under control, you should be able to lead a fairly normal life.

Tell your doctor what you do in your job. If you have a job where you're physically
active, you may need to adapt it to suit you, or think about whether you can continue
to do it.

Your doctor should be able to advise you about whether you can drive. You'll need
to tell the driving authority where you live about your heart failure. For example,
in the UK, it's the Driving and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA).

Some people worry about whether they'll be able to have sex. It's unlikely to be a
problem. If you're worried, you can talk to your doctor. Doctors discuss this with
many patients, so you shouldn’t feel embarrassed.

If you have problems sleeping because you're short of breath, try using pillows to
prop yourself up. Some people with heart failure have to get up and go to the toilet
at night.

If this bothers you, ask your doctor if it's possible to take your diuretics (tablets
that make your body get rid of water) in the morning so they're less likely to cause
you to get up at night.

When to call the doctor
It’s important that you watch for any changes in your symptoms. If you get a new problem,
or any of your symptoms get worse, call your doctor.

Things to watch out for include a cough, changes in your weight, shortness of breath
when you're resting, trouble sleeping, lack of appetite, or more swelling in your
legs than usual.

Chest pain, trouble breathing, and feeling as if you're going to pass out can all
be signs of an emergency. Call an ambulance straight away if you get any of these."

It can be frightening to hear your doctor talk about heart failure. It is a serious
condition. But it doesn't mean that your heart is about to stop working or that you're
about to die. There are good treatments that can help, and many people live with heart
failure for many years.

What is heart failure?
Heart failure means your heart isn't pumping blood around your body as well as it
should. It usually happens because your heart has been damaged by another medical
condition. For example, a heart attack can damage your heart and lead to heart failure.


There are several different types of heart failure. The kind you have depends on which
part of your heart has been damaged.

What are the symptoms?
One of the main symptoms of heart failure is feeling breathless. It's normal to gasp
for breath after exercise, but if you have heart failure, you may get out of breath
doing everyday things.

You may find it especially hard to breathe when you're lying down. Many people with
heart failure prop themselves up with pillows at night.

Heart failure can also make you feel weak and tired. You feel tired because your heart
can't pump enough blood to your muscles to give them all the energy they need.

Heart failure also causes your body to hold onto too much water. This extra water
can leak into your lungs. This can cause you to cough up pink, frothy phlegm. You
may find the extra water makes your feet, legs, and ankles swollen and puffy.

Your doctor will need to examine you carefully and do tests before he or she can say
for sure you have heart failure.

What treatments work?
There are several treatments that can help if you have heart failure. Medicines can
keep your symptoms under control, help you feel better, and help you live longer.

One of the main reasons that people with heart failure end up in hospital is because
they stop taking their medicine. Even if you don't like taking them, don't stop without
talking to your doctor.

Eating healthily and taking exercise can also help if you have heart failure. To read
more, see our information on self-care for people with heart failure. Talk to your
doctor about how to get started with exercise, if you are unsure. Many people start
with a gentle walk.

Common medicines for heart failure
You'll probably need to take several medicines together. Your doctor may suggest that
you take types of medicines called ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers, and maybe other
medicines too.



ACE inhibitors widen your blood vessels, which takes some of the strain off your heart.


Beta-blockers work by slowing your heart down so it doesn't need as much oxygen.


Diuretics help your body get rid of extra water. You may need to take them for a while
to help you feel less breathless and reduce the swelling in your feet and legs.



All medicines can have side effects. Talk to your doctor if you get symptoms that
you think are caused by your medicines. You may be able to change to a different type
or dose.

Other treatments
If you're taking medicine and you still get symptoms, make sure you see your doctor.
He or she might suggest you try different drugs. You may also be given treatment for
the particular kind of heart failure you have.

For example, if your heart beat is irregular, you may be given medicine to help it
beat more normally. Also, if your heart failure gets worse for a time, you might need
extra medicines while it gets better.

Surgery can also be used to treat heart failure. If the blood vessels in your heart
are blocked or damaged, surgery may help to repair them. If your heart doesn't beat
at the right speed, or the different parts of your heart don't beat together, a pacemaker
may help.

You might also have a device inserted in your chest that can shock your heart into
starting again if it stops beating. This is called a defibrillator. Defibrillators
are sometimes combined with pacemakers.

What will happen to me?
Being told you have a serious illness can come as a big shock. You may be wondering
how heart failure will affect your future, or be worried that it will shorten your
life.

It’s difficult to say exactly what will happen to you. Heart failure is a complicated
illness, and it affects people differently. But lots of people with heart failure
are treated successfully and live for many years.

If your heart failure gets worse for a time, you may need to go into hospital for
treatment and to be looked after. You might need extra treatments at this time.

You're likely to do better if you try to keep healthy and make sure you take your
medicines. There are also things you can do yourself to keep healthy and out of hospital.
To read more, see our information on self-care for people with heart failure.

Where to get more help and support
Heart failure is a serious condition, and it's important to get all the help and support
that's available. Many people find it useful to talk to other people with heart failure.
You could ask your doctor about support groups in your area. For example, in the UK,
the British Heart Foundation (bhf.org.uk) keeps a list of all the heart support groups
in England and Wales."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1538213063043/Heart%20attack%3A%20what%20is%20it%3F,Heart attack: what is it?,"Heart attack: what is it? Last published: Sep 20, 2021
If you've had a heart attack it probably came as a big shock to you. But there are
good treatments available for people who have had a heart attack. This leaflet gives
you information about heart attacks and about recovering and staying healthy afterwards.

We've brought together the best and most up-to-date research about heart attacks to
see what treatments work. You can use our information to talk to your doctor and decide
which treatments are best for you.

What happens when you have a heart attack?
Your heart pumps blood around your body. It carries oxygen and energy to your muscles.
Your heart is made of muscle and it needs a good blood supply to keep pumping.

When you have a heart attack, one of the blood vessels that carries blood to your
heart gets blocked by a blood clot. When this happens the heart doesn't get enough
oxygen. This often causes severe chest pain and makes you feel breathless. If the
blood supply is cut off for too long part of the heart will die.

If you've been taken to hospital after having a heart attack you will have had emergency
treatment in hospital to open up the blood vessel and get the blood flowing again.
This is done with medicines, and often also by an operation called an angioplasty.
These treatments can limit the damage to your heart.

Doctors will then keep a close watch over you to see if you develop any other problems.
These problems can include having an irregular heart beat, or problems with how well
your heart pumps. If a large amount of your heart muscle has been damaged by the heart
attack, your heart may not pump so well as before. This is called heart failure.

The most risky time is the few hours after the heart attack. Once you are beyond that
you'll probably spend several days resting in hospital. During this time doctors will
do more tests to try to find out which part of your heart has been damaged, and how
much.

If all goes well you'll probably go home about a week after your heart attack.
Why did I have a heart attack?
Having a heart attack is a big shock, especially if you were in good health before
it happened. You may wonder why it happened to you. Heart attacks are caused by blood
clots that form in your arteries. Doctors don't know exactly why they cause problems
for some people and not others.

But you're more likely to have problems if your arteries are narrow because of clumps
of fat on the artery wall. Doctors call this atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is more
common in older people. If you have atherosclerosis in the arteries leading to your
heart, this is called heart disease. You might have heart disease for many years without
knowing it. A heart attack might be the first sign of trouble.

Other things that increase your chance of having a heart attack include:


being a man. Men are more likely than women to have a heart attack. But this only
applies to younger men and women. After the menopause women are no less likely than
men to have a heart attack.



having high blood pressure.


having diabetes. People with diabetes usually need to take medicines to help them
avoid heart problems.



having high cholesterol in your blood.


being overweight.


smoking.


not taking regular exercise.


having a close family member who has had a heart attack while still fairly young (under
about 60 years old).



These things (doctors call them risk factors) make heart attacks more likely. But
even if several of these risk factors apply to you, it doesn't mean you'll definitely
have a heart attack. Some people with many risk factors will never have a heart attack,
while some people will have a heart attack even though they have none of these risk
factors.

What happens when you go home?
When you go home from hospital you can start gradually getting your life back to normal.
If you live alone, it may help to have someone stay with you for a few weeks, to help
you adjust.

You may feel anxious about what you can and can't do. The key is to take things slowly.
You will gradually be able to do more without getting tired and breathless.

It's normal to feel tired, anxious, angry, or low after a stressful event like a heart
attack. But if your low mood continues, talk to your doctor. Some people become depressed
after a heart attack. But there are treatments that can help you.

Most people who live through a straightforward heart attack can return to their normal
level of activity within six weeks, although getting back to work might take several
months.

Cardiac rehabilitation programmes are available in many areas. These are programmes
where you get support from specialist nurses and other specialists to help you recover.
Before you leave hospital, you and your doctors should discuss how you can join a
programme. If your doctors don't mention it, ask.

What will happen to me in the longer term?
How you get along after a heart attack depends on how much of your heart has been
damaged. Your recovery also depends on how well you stick to your drug treatment and
your plans to have a more healthy life.

Some people who have had a heart attack get chest pain (angina) and feel short of
breath from time to time.

Angina happens when your heart doesn't get enough blood: for example, when you exercise
or go out in the cold. It goes away with rest. Your doctor can give you medicine to
help with the pain caused by angina.

Shortness of breath may mean your heart is not pumping as well as before the heart
attack.

To predict how well you'll do after a heart attack doctors look at several things:


Is your heart pumping properly?


Where has your heart been damaged? Attacks that damage the front of your heart are
more dangerous than those that affect the back or base of your heart.



What was your blood pressure and how fast was your heart beating when you were admitted
to hospital? If you had low blood pressure and your heart was beating quickly, you
probably had a serious heart attack.



How old are you? The older you are, the more likely it is that your heart attack was
dangerous.



Remember that you are over the first hurdle: you survived your heart attack. Sticking
to your treatments and making some healthy changes to your lifestyle gives you the
best chance of a longer, healthier life.

Where to get more help
There are many charities, support groups, and other organisations that offer advice
and support to people who have had a heart attack. Your doctor should be able to help
you find one in your area or to help you find help online. For example, in the UK,
the British Heart Foundation (http://www.bhf.org.uk) is a registered charity that
provides advice and support to people with heart conditions, including people who've
had a heart attack."

https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1515298654662/Head%20lice,Head lice,"Head lice Last published: Jan 04, 2022
Head lice are harmless, although they may make your head feel itchy. There are treatments
available. Some children get head lice repeatedly.

What are head lice?
Head lice are small insects that live on people's scalps. They spread from one person
to another, usually through head-to-head contact.

Having head lice is nothing to be ashamed of. It doesn't mean you don't keep yourself
clean. Head lice can't tell the difference between clean hair and dirty hair. They
are common, especially among children.

Sometimes head lice are called nits, even though the word 'nits' really means the
shells of their eggs.

You can catch head lice if your hair touches the hair of someone who has them. But
head lice move slowly. Your hair needs to be touching someone else's hair for about
half a minute to catch lice. You're very unlikely to catch them from using someone
else's hat, or pillow. Lice don't live for very long away from the scalp.

How do I know if I have head lice?
Head lice are not easy to see, so you may not notice them straight away.
Sometimes they make your head itch. But the only way to know that you have head lice
is to find a live louse in your hair. Finding something that looks like a louse egg
or nit does not mean that you have head lice.

A fully grown head louse is flat and about the size of a sesame seed. They don't have
wings. Head lice are usually greyish-brown, but the colour can vary. You may find
them when you comb your hair.

What treatments work?
There are two basic ways to try to get rid of head lice. You can either try to remove
them by combing them out, or use a chemical treatment to kill them. Chemical treatments
include insecticides, which poison the lice, or occlusive treatments, which kill them
by covering them up.

Sometimes insecticides don't work because the lice have become resistant to the chemicals
(this means that the chemicals will no longer kill all the lice). If this happens,
you will have to try a different treatment.

Removing head lice by combing
This involves thoroughly combing wet hair with conditioner, using a comb with very
fine teeth that can pick out lice. You can buy these combs in a pharmacy.

The idea is that by removing lice, you'll stop them laying eggs. After about two weeks,
all the lice should have been removed. You need to carefully comb through your hair,
or your child's hair, every two to three days for at least two weeks, to catch any
newly hatched lice. You should keep carrying it out until you have found no lice for
at least three combing sessions in a row.

Chemical treatments: insecticides
Lotions that poison head lice are called insecticides. Ask your doctor or pharmacist
which treatment is best to try first where you live. Insecticides are not all suitable
for young children.

You will probably need to apply the treatments at least twice, seven days apart, to
be sure all the head lice have gone. Read the instructions carefully to see how to
use the treatment and how long you need to leave it on the scalp.

Some people are concerned that some insecticides can cause health damage. But experts
say there is nothing to show that the low doses used for head lice treatments are
harmful. Some insecticides catch fire easily, so you need to take great care when
using them.

Chemical treatments: occlusive treatments
Dimeticone is an example of an occlusive treatment. It is made from silicone. It kills
the lice by coating them so water can't get in or out of their bodies. Because it
is not an insecticide, head lice are less likely to be resistant to it. You need to
repeat the treatment after seven days. Some people try using other substances to coat
lice, for example, petroleum jelly or hair conditioners or lotions.

What will happen?
Head lice are rarely a serious problem, but they can be annoying. And if you don't
get rid of them, they can spread to other people. You should check everyone in your
house for lice, and treat them if necessary.

If you don't treat head lice, the problem will get worse as the lice breed. The scalp
may get sore and itchy.

Head lice will not clear up on their own, so you shouldn't ignore them. It's easier
to get rid of them if you treat them quickly.

Tell people you or your child has close contact with, even if you find this difficult.
They can then check their hair or their children's hair. Head lice spread easily in
families and schools. If you don't tell people, the lice will spread in your community
and you or your child might catch them again."

If you have hay fever, it's a good idea to avoid pollen and mould as much as you can.
There are things you can do when the chances of getting hay fever symptoms are high.
You may not be able to completely avoid these allergens, but the following steps may
help.

If you're allergic to pollen:


check the pollen forecasts every day. You may be able to find the pollen count online.
For example, in the UK this information is available on the Met Office website (metoffice.gov.uk)



when the pollen count is high, stay indoors as much as you can and keep your windows
closed. Bear in mind that pollen levels are often highest in the early morning, between
5 a.m. and 10 a.m.



if possible, don't go outside at all if your symptoms are really bad. If you must
go out, stay outside for as little time as possible



don't dry your clothes outdoors. Pollen in the air may stick to your clothes


keep pollen away from your eyes by wearing sunglasses that fit close to your eyes


when you're in a car, keep the windows closed and use air conditioning if you have
it. Some cars have pollen filters



consider trying HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) filters in your home




if you've been outside for a while, take a shower to wash the pollen off your skin


avoid air pollution, tobacco smoke, and other irritants such as insect sprays, fresh
paint, and tar. They may make your hay fever symptoms worse.



If you're allergic to mould:


avoid places where mould grows, such as moist, shady areas and compost piles


try to keep your home dry inside. Check for causes of damp, and consider using a dehumidifier


check your home for mould damage. Small areas of mould can be removed with diluted
bleach. But larger areas might require replacing the affected surface or material.
Repainting problem walls and ceilings with antifungal paint is another option



don't cut the grass or rake leaves - and don’t be in the garden when someone else
is doing these things.



Some people's symptoms are also affected by dust mites. Measures to reduce problems
with dust mites include:



encasing mattresses, pillows, and quilts/duvets in impermeable covers


washing all bedding weekly


using HEPA filters


using a dehumidifier, and


using chemical treatments called acaricides on carpets and upholstery to control dust
mites. You might even want to think about removing carpets in favour of non-fabric
flooring, such as wood or tiles."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1583327112089/Hay%20fever,Hay fever,"Hay fever Last published: Aug 16, 2021
If you sneeze, get a blocked nose, and have puffy eyes at the same time every year,
you probably have hay fever, which is an allergy to some types of pollen. It can be
annoying but there are treatments that can help.

Things such as pet hair, mould, and dust mites can cause similar symptoms to those
caused by hay fever, and the treatments are often the same. But this information mainly
deals with symptoms caused by pollen.

What is it?
Hay fever is an allergy. Allergies happen when your body overreacts to something that's
harmless to most people. If you have hay fever you're allergic to the pollen or spores
that plants release into the air.

The amount of pollen in the air depends on the time of year. For example, in the UK
the hay fever season runs from around April to August, although it varies from year
to year and from place to place around the country.

What are the symptoms?
Hay fever can make you sneeze a lot. You may also get a runny, itchy, or blocked nose.
Severe hay fever can give you a tickly cough, make your eyes water and turn red, and
make your throat or ears itch.

There are other allergies that cause similar symptoms to hay fever. Hay fever usually
affects people for a few weeks or months at the same time every year. But if you get
symptoms more often you may be allergic to something else, such as animal fur.

If your doctor isn't sure whether you have hay fever or another allergy, he or she
can do tests to find out.

You should tell your doctor if you cough or wheeze when you have hay fever. Your doctor
may want to check whether you have asthma.

What treatments work?
There are several good treatments for hay fever. Most of them come as tablets or as
a spray you breathe in through your nose. You can buy some treatments from a pharmacy,
but for some you will need a prescription from your doctor.

Avoiding pollen
It helps to avoid pollen as much as you can, although sometimes it's not possible.
With the right treatment you shouldn't have to stop doing the things you want to do.


You'll probably find your symptoms are worse when the pollen count is high - the pollen
count is a measure of how much pollen is in the air at a particular time.

You'll often see pollen counts mentioned in weather reports, or you can look them
up online. For example, in the UK you can get pollen forecasts from the Met Office
website (metoffice.gov.uk).

There are some things you can do to avoid the worst pollen levels.


Pollen levels tend to be higher on warm, dry, breezy days. They're worst in the morning,
before 10 a.m. So try to minimise the time you spend outside at these times.



It may help if you avoid drying your clothes outdoors. This can help keep pollen off
your clothes.



When you're outside, close-fitting sunglasses may help keep pollen out of your eyes.




If you're driving, keep the car windows closed and use air conditioning, if you have
it. If you have air conditioning in your home, use it in the recycler/indoor mode.



Things like air pollution, tobacco smoke, or insect repellent sprays can all make
your hay fever worse. So you may want to avoid these too.



Medicines for hay fever
Antihistamines and similar medicines
If you have mild hay fever, antihistamines may be the only treatment you need. They come as tablets, liquids, and nasal sprays.
You can buy some antihistamines from a pharmacy, but you'll need a doctor's prescription
for others.

Antihistamines can help reduce the symptoms of hay fever, such as a runny nose and
sneezing. They don't help as much with a blocked nose.

The most common side effect of antihistamines is drowsiness. If you feel drowsy after
taking antihistamines you shouldn't drive or use heavy machinery. You may want to
talk to your doctor about trying a different antihistamine.

Some newer antihistamines are less likely than older ones to cause drowsiness. But
you should still be cautious about things like driving, especially if you have never
taken antihistamines before.

If you find that antihistamines don't help much with your symptoms, or that they only
help with some of them, you could ask your doctor about taking more than one medicine.

For example, medicines called leukotriene receptor antagonists seem to work better than antihistamines for a blocked nose.

Another medicine that can help with a stuffy, runny, or blocked nose is sodium cromoglicate nasal spray. But doctors usually only recommend it if other treatments haven't worked.

Steroid sprays and tablets
If you've tried antihistamines and you still have symptoms that are quite severe,
you may want to try a steroid nasal spray.

The steroids used for hay fever (their full name is corticosteroids) are not the same
as the anabolic steroids that some bodybuilders use. You can use a steroid nasal spray
together with an antihistamine.

Steroids can help with sneezing, a runny and itchy nose, and feeling blocked up. They
probably work better than antihistamines, but doctors don't recommend using them unless
other treatments haven't worked.

You need to take a steroid spray once or twice a day, and keep taking it every day
through the hay fever season.

Your spray will work best if you start using it about two weeks before the hay fever
season starts. It can sometimes cause nosebleeds or irritation in your nose.

You will need a prescription for most nasal steroid sprays, especially if they are
for children. Your doctor may be cautious about prescribing them for children unless
their symptoms are severe. This is because of concerns that steroids can slow children's
growth.

If your symptoms are severe your doctor might recommend a short course (usually only
a few days) of steroid tablets.

But your doctor will want to make sure that you take the lowest possible dose that
is helpful. This is because steroids used for long periods can cause side effects,
including raised blood sugar.

Decongestants
For a badly blocked nose, decongestants seem to help if you take them together with
an antihistamine. You may be able to buy a decongestant called pseudoephedrine from
a pharmacy, either on its own or combined with an antihistamine in one tablet.

You could also try decongestant nasal sprays or tablets, but you shouldn't take these
for longer than 3 to 5 days. After that, they can make your blocked nose worse when
you stop taking them.

Pseudoephedrine can cause side effects in some people, including headaches and problems
sleeping. Decongestant tablets aren't usually recommended for children with hay fever.


When the usual treatments don't work
Some people's symptoms are so bad that they severely affect their quality of life.
For example, they may have trouble sleeping, working, and enjoying family life.

If your symptoms affect you in this way and the usual treatments don't work your doctor
may be able to refer you to a specialist.

You might be able to have a treatment called immunotherapy. This is done by giving you tiny amounts of what is causing your symptoms, so that
your body gets used to it.

If the treatment goes well you are gradually given more of what is causing your symptoms,
until your body can cope with no problems.

What will happen to me?
Most people who get hay fever just find it a nuisance. But severe hay fever can get
in the way of everyday activities, like school, work, or sport. Hay fever can be especially
difficult for children.

Most people with mild hay fever can find what they need at the pharmacy. But if your
hay fever gets bad, see your doctor. He or she will be able to suggest stronger treatments
than the ones you can get from a pharmacy.

The good news for many people with hay fever is that about half of people find that
their hay fever improves or goes away completely as they get older."

If you see bright red blood on the toilet paper after going to the toilet you might
have haemorrhoids (piles). They aren't dangerous and they often go away on their own.
But if you find them uncomfortable there are treatments that can help.

What are haemorrhoids?
Haemorrhoids are swollen blood vessels around your anus and inside your rectum. They
happen when the small blood vessels in the lining of your rectum become wider and
swollen with blood. Sometimes the swellings can appear on the outside of your anus.
You might be able to push them back in.

You might get haemorrhoids if you often have to strain when you go to the toilet (for
example, if you're constipated). Many women get haemorrhoids when they're pregnant,
but they often go away after they've given birth.

What are the symptoms?
Small haemorrhoids might cause only mild discomfort or none at all. But large haemorrhoids
can be irritating, itchy, or painful. They might also make you feel as if you haven't
completely emptied your bowels even when you have.

Many people with haemorrhoids notice bright red blood on the toilet paper or in the
toilet bowl. This is usually because their haemorrhoids are bleeding but it can also
be a sign of a more serious problem, such as bowel cancer.

If you have bleeding it's important to see your doctor. Your doctor will examine you
and order tests if you need them.

What treatments work?
Several treatments can help with haemorrhoids. What treatments your doctor recommends
depends on how much your haemorrhoids are bothering you, how large they are, and whether
they are inside or outside of your anus.

Doctors often recommend an operation (called a haemorrhoidectomy) to remove haemorrhoids
that are outside the anus.

Things you can do for yourself
There are simple treatments you can try yourself. If these work you might not need
any other treatment.

Eating plenty of fibre can help prevent and treat constipation, making your stools
bulkier and easier to pass without straining. Fruit, vegetables, and wholemeal bread
have lots of fibre.

Or you could try a fibre supplement, such as ispaghula husk or methylcellulose. Drinking
plenty of water can also soften your stools.

You should go to the toilet as soon as you feel the need. Waiting can mean you get
harder stools that are more difficult to pass. Try not to strain and don't sit on
the toilet for long periods of time.

To soothe itching or pain you can buy ointments, creams, and suppositories (tablets
you put up your rectum) in a pharmacy. Some contain a local anaesthetic or a corticosteroid
drug. Corticosteroids are strong anti-inflammatories that help reduce swelling (inflammation).

You can get stronger corticosteroid creams from your doctor. However, you should only
use corticosteroid creams for a short time as they can thin your skin with long-term
use.

Some people find that a warm bath is soothing.
If these simple treatments don't work you might need other therapies such as banding,
injections, infrared treatment, or surgery. You will also probably need other treatments
if your haemorrhoids are outside of your anus or are causing more severe symptoms.


Banding
Banding is a simple and effective treatment for haemorrhoids that are inside the anus.
It involves putting a rubber band around the base of the haemorrhoid to cut off its
blood supply, making it drop off.

It's usually done in hospital. It only takes a few minutes and it isn't usually painful.
You might hear it called rubber band ligation. Side effects, such as some bleeding
and pain, can affect some people who have this treatment.

Injections
Injections can be used to try to shrink haemorrhoids that are inside the anus. This
is called sclerotherapy. It is often used when a haemorrhoid is too small to have
a rubber band put around it.

Your doctor injects a chemical into the swollen blood vessel, which causes it to collapse
inwards. Some people get pain or bleeding after this treatment.

Infrared treatment
This treatment uses a device that gives off infrared light to burn away haemorrhoids
that are inside the anus. You might hear it called infrared photocoagulation.

As with injections, it is often used for haemorrhoids that are too small to have a
rubber band put around them. However, unlike injections, it requires multiple treatment
sessions.

Stitching closed the blood supply
This is another option for treating haemorrhoids that are inside the anus. It is called
haemorrhoidal artery ligation and it involves stitching closed the arteries that supply
blood to your haemorrhoids.

This causes the haemorrhoids to shrink. People usually have a general anaesthetic
for this procedure, so they are not awake.

Some people get pain, bleeding, and other problems after this treatment. It is less
likely to cause problems than other types of surgery for haemorrhoids, such as having
an operation to remove your haemorrhoids (haemorrhoidectomy).

Stapling
A newer type of operation uses a circular stapling device to lift your haemorrhoids
higher to where they're less likely to cause problems. This also reduces the blood
supply to the haemorrhoids and they gradually shrink.

The operation, which is called a stapled haemorrhoidopexy, is done inside your rectum
rather than on the sensitive skin around your anus.

You should have less pain and a shorter recovery than if you were to have surgery
to remove your haemorrhoids (haemorrhoidectomy). You will probably have a general
anaesthetic to make you sleep.

This operation can sometimes lead to serious problems, such as a hole developing in
the wall of the rectum. But these problems are rare.

Surgery to remove haemorrhoids
If other treatments haven't helped, or if your haemorrhoids are outside your anus
or causing severe symptoms, your doctor might recommend having surgery to remove them.

This is called a haemorrhoidectomy. It's done in hospital. You'll either be given
a general anaesthetic to make you sleep or a local anaesthetic to numb the area. Your
haemorrhoids will be cut away. The wound will either be closed with stitches or be
left to heal naturally.

An operation to remove haemorrhoids can work well. People who have this operation
rarely find that their haemorrhoids return. You might get some bleeding and pain afterwards.

Some people get more serious problems, such as an infection or difficulty controlling
bowel movements. But the chance of these problems is small.

What will happen to me?
You might find that your haemorrhoids come and go. They can even come back after treatment,
but it's rare to get serious problems."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1488982215386/Guillain-Barre%20syndrome,Guillain-Barre syndrome,"Guillain-Barre syndrome Last published: Sep 20, 2021
Guillain-Barre syndrome is a rare condition that affects the nerves, causing muscle
weakness, numbness, pain, and sometimes paralysis. With treatment most people make
a full recovery. But it can cause long-term problems and is sometimes life threatening.


What is Guillain-Barre syndrome?
Guillain-Barre syndrome is a condition that affects the nerves, causing muscle weakness,
problems with movement, and sometimes temporary paralysis (being unable to move at
all).

We don’t know for sure what causes Guillain-Barre syndrome, but it seems to be caused
by problems with the immune system. Your immune system is your body’s defence against
infection by bacteria and viruses. When you get an infection, antibodies attack and
kill the germs.

But with Guillain-Barre syndrome your antibodies start to attack the nervous system.
It can happen to people of all ages but it seems to be slightly more common in men
and boys than in women and girls.

In many people Guillain-Barre syndrome happens within a few weeks of having had an
infection, such as a chest infection or a bad stomach upset (gastroenteritis). Guillain-Barre
syndrome has also been linked to the Zika virus in recent years.

What are the symptoms?
The symptoms of Guillain-Barre syndrome usually start in the arms and legs, with tingling
and numbness in the hands and feet followed by weakness and difficulty bending your
joints. These symptoms might get worse over several days. You might also notice:



pain in your legs and back. The pain seems to be worse in children


breathing problems


trouble with your speech


weakness or drooping in your facial muscles


trouble swallowing


double vision.


Some people’s symptoms are so severe that they become unable to move at all. This
can last for several months while they have treatment and recover.

Tests for Guillain-Barre syndrome
If your doctor thinks you may have Guillain-Barre syndrome he or she will want to
do some tests to make sure.

Your doctor will test how well your nerves are working. This is done by testing how
well your muscles react when the nearby nerves are stimulated by weak electrical signals.
These electrical signals can be passed through sensors attached to your skin, or through
tiny needles inserted into some of your muscles.

Lumbar puncture
To help make a definite diagnosis your doctor will probably want to check a sample
of the fluid in your spine (your cerebrospinal fluid). To do this, your doctor uses
a needle to remove some of the fluid. This is called a lumbar puncture.

Before having a lumbar puncture you will have a scan to make sure that the procedure
is likely to be safe and won’t cause any damage.

You will also have a local anaesthetic to help reduce pain while the doctor draws
out the sample of spinal fluid. But having a lumbar puncture is still likely to cause
some discomfort. The whole procedure takes about 30 to 45 minutes.

What treatments are available?
Most people with Guillain-Barre syndrome need to be treated in hospital, usually for
at least several weeks. Some people may need to stay in hospital for several months.


As well as treatment to stop your immune system from attacking your nerves (called
immunotherapy) you will be supported in other ways. For example, you may need help
to keep you breathing properly while your nerves and muscles recover.

Immunotherapy
Immunotherapy is the main treatment for Guillain-Barre syndrome. There are two types
of treatment and they both seem to work about as well as each other.

The first is called intravenous immunoglubulin (IVIG for short). IVIG is made from donated blood and it contains healthy antibodies
that won’t attack your immune system. You are given this treatment through an intravenous
(IV) drip. If you have IVIG you will probably have it every day for about five days.


The other type of immunotherapy you might be given is called plasma exchange (plasmapheresis). You are connected to a machine that filters the harmful antibodies
out of your blood. If you have plasma exchange you will need to have this treatment
several times over a few days.

Other treatments
Some people’s muscles become so weak that, for a while, they need help to breathe
properly. This can be done using a machine called a ventilator. About 30 in 100 people
with Guillain-Barre syndrome need help with their breathing in this way.

You will also have regular checks to make sure your heart is working as it should:
for example, your blood pressure will be monitored to check that it isn’t getting
too high.

Lying still for long periods can also increase your chance of deep vein thrombosis
(DVT). This is when a blood clot forms in a vein. Your doctor might recommend that
you have drug treatment to reduce the chance of this happening.

You might also be given drug treatments to help with any pain that is affecting your
nerves.

If you have been unable to move much or at all for a while, you might need help with
rehabilitation when you are able to move again. A physiotherapist will guide you through
exercises to help you move your limbs and muscles properly once more.

What to expect in the future?
About 85 in 100 people who get Guillain-Barre syndrome make a good recovery. But older
people, those whose muscles have been badly damaged, and those who needed ventilator
treatment are less likely to make a good recovery.

Some people will have muscle weakness that lasts for several years and some people
may not be able to walk again for many months.

Some people die from Guillain-Barre syndrome. This is more common in older people
and in people with more severe symptoms.

Your doctor will want to check on you every few months after you have recovered, and
then every year. Some people become ill again and need to have more treatment."

Sometimes newborn babies become infected with bacteria (germs) called group B streptococcus.
The bacteria are passed on from a mother to her baby during birth. This infection
can be serious and needs to be treated quickly. Women are sometimes given antibiotics
during labour to prevent this infection.
We've looked at the best and most up-to-date research to produce this information.
You can use it to talk to your doctor and decide which treatments are right for you
and your baby.

What is it?
Infection with group B streptococcus is quite rare but serious, as it can make a newborn
baby very ill.

Group B streptococcus is also called group B strep or GBS. Group B strep can live
in your body without causing any problems. But if these bacteria spread from a mother
to her baby during birth, they can cause serious illnesses, including infections of
the blood (sepsis), in the lungs (pneumonia), in the urinary tract, and around the
brain (meningitis).

There are two main types of group B strep infection in babies.
If a baby gets group B strep infection in the first six days of life, it's called
early-onset infection. Doctors think this happens when babies breathe in fluid that contains group B strep
during labour.

If a baby gets group B strep infection from seven days to three months after birth,
it's called late-onset infection. Doctors aren't certain how this infection happens.

This information is about preventing and treating early-onset group B strep infections.

What are the symptoms?
Most babies who get early-onset group B strep infections become ill within the first
few hours of their life.

Some signs and symptoms of early infection in newborn babies are:


Rapid breathing or difficulty breathing (often the first symptom)


Grunting


A high temperature (fever), or a low temperature


Difficulty feeding or not wanting to feed


Being floppy, limp, and hard to wake up.


It's very important that you get medical help straight away if you think that your
baby is ill. Group B strep infection is serious, and your baby may become very ill
very quickly.

Preventing group B strep in newborn babies
To protect newborn babies from group B strep, pregnant women are sometimes given antibiotics
during labour. Antibiotics are medicines that kill bacteria. They are given through
a drip into a vein (an intravenous infusion, or IV). This helps prevent the group
B strep bacteria from passing from the woman to her baby during birth.

Different countries have different guidelines for deciding whether a woman should
be treated with antibiotics during labour.

In some countries, such as the US, doctors are advised to test all pregnant women
late in their pregnancy to see if they have the group B strep bacteria. This is done
by using a swab to take a sample of cells from the woman's vagina and rectum. If the
test shows that the woman is carrying group B strep, she'll be given antibiotics during
labour.

In other countries, such as the UK, doctors don't routinely test pregnant women for
group B strep. Instead, women may be offered antibiotics during labour if they have
a raised chance of having group B strep and passing it to their baby. This includes:



Women who had a baby with group B strep infection before


Women who had group strep B found in their urine at some time during their pregnancy.


A woman may also be offered antibiotic treatment if:


She has a fever during labour


She goes into labour before the end of her 37th week of pregnancy


Her waters break early.


Babies at most risk of getting a group B strep infection may be given antibiotics
when they are born, to try to prevent the infection. But doctors don't always agree
about whether all babies who are at risk should be given antibiotic treatment. If
your baby is well and has no signs of an infection, they will probably not need treatment.

Treating group B strep in newborn babies
If your baby is unwell, you should get medical help straight away. Babies who have
group B strep infection need to be treated quickly with antibiotics.

Antibiotics cure the infection in most babies. They are given to your baby through
a drip. They can cause side effects, but these are usually mild, such as diarrhoea
or a rash.

What will happen to my baby?
Newborn babies who get group B strep infection need to be treated as soon as possible.
Most babies who are treated early make a full recovery. But a few babies die. Also,
some babies who get a group B strep infection of the fluid and lining around the brain
(meningitis) will have permanent nerve damage. They may get problems with their hearing
or sight, or seizures (fits). About half of babies who get meningitis from a group
B strep infection go on to have long-term problems.

Where to get more help
There are support groups and other organisations that provide information and assistance
for families affected by group B strep. You can ask your doctor for recommendations
or look online. One example in the UK is Group B Strep Support (http://www.gbss.org.uk)."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/3000204/Grommets,Grommets,"Grommets Last published: Jan 05, 2023
This information explains what you can expect if your child has an operation to put
grommets in his or her ears.

It explains how the operation is done, how it can help, what the risks are, and what
to expect afterwards.

Bear in mind that procedures can vary between hospitals. You can use our information
to discuss your child’s treatment with the doctors and nurses treating them.

What are grommets?
Grommets are a treatment used for a type of ear problem called glue ear. The medical term for glue ear is otitis media with effusion. It happens most commonly in young children, but adults sometimes get it, too.

Glue ear happens when the middle part of the ear canal fills up with fluid. It’s not
always clear why some people get glue ear, but causes are thought to include:



infections


problems with the eustachian tube (the tube that runs between the middle ear and the
back of the throat), and



inflammation (swelling) of the middle ear.


It’s normal to have some fluid in the middle ear. It usually drains through the eustachian
tube to the back of the nose and throat.

In small children the eustachian tube is narrow and can easily become blocked - often
after they have a cold. If this happens, the fluid in the middle ear can’t drain away
and becomes thick and sticky.

The main problem that glue ear causes is difficulty hearing. This can affect how your child learns in school, and how he or she interacts with
family and friends.

Grommets are small tubes that can be put inside children’s ears to let air flow in and out
of the middle ear. This helps to control the pressure in the middle ear, and this
stops fluid from building up.

Why might my child need grommets?
Because glue ear tends to get better by itself over time, there is some doubt whether
grommets are worthwhile in the long run. They don’t cure glue ear. But they can help
some children’s hearing improve more quickly than if they didn’t have them fitted.

Doctors usually advise that children with glue ear wait for a while before having
grommets inserted, to see if the problem clears up by itself. This approach is called
watchful waiting.

Doctors only tend to suggest grommets if your child has:


had glue ear for at least three months


had ear infections several times, one after another


lost 25 to 30 decibels of hearing in the less affected ear. Decibels are a way of
measuring how loud a sound is. For example, if your child has a hearing loss of 30
decibels, normal conversation will sound like a soft whisper.



Grommets aren’t usually recommended if your child has hearing loss in only one ear.
If your child has an ear infection, a cold, or a sore throat, his or her adenoids can get infected and swollen. The adenoids are small lumps at the back of children’s
noses. They’re part of the body’s system for fighting infection.

Swollen adenoids can block the openings of the eustachian tubes, which can make glue
ear worse. Sometimes, surgeons take out the adenoids when they put grommets in. Taking
out your child’s adenoids is a bigger operation than putting in grommets.

What will happen?
The operation to put grommets in takes about 20 minutes. Younger children are usually
given a general anaesthetic to make them sleep during surgery, but older children
can have a local anaesthetic. They’ll be awake but they won’t feel any pain.

During the operation:


the surgeon tilts your child’s head to one side, opens the ear canal using an instrument
called a speculum, and looks into the ear with a microscope



the surgeon then makes a tiny cut in the lower part of their eardrum. The fluid that
has built up in their middle ear drains out, helped by a suction tube



once all the fluid has been sucked away, the grommet is put in through the hole. Grommets
are tiny tubes. One end stays on each side of your child’s eardrum. This keeps the
hole open, and lets air into your child’s middle ear



your child’s head is then tilted the other way, and the surgeon repeats the operation
on the other ear.



Grommets are a few millimetres long and made of plastic (a millimetre is about 1/25
of an inch).

There are different types designed to stay in your child’s eardrum for different lengths
of time. When deciding what type of tube to use, your doctor will think about how
long your child is likely to have glue ear.

Most doctors use tubes that are designed to fall out after 6-12 months.
Your child won’t need any stitches or dressings and probably won’t have to spend a
night in hospital.

How might grommets help my child?
Grommets don’t cure glue ear. But they can help to clear the fluid from inside your
child’s ears and improve their hearing until they grow out of glue ear.

Grommets can help your child to hear better. But in some children the difference might
be fairly small, while others notice a big difference.

Grommets can help in other ways. For example, as well as having improved hearing,
your child might:



get fewer ear infections


feel happier and do better in school. But this is hard to study accurately because
most children grow out of glue ear fairly quickly



stop having problems with glue ear more quickly than they would without grommets.


Glue ear takes longer to clear up when children have family members who smoke. This
is true even if they have grommets inserted.

What are the risks?
All operations carry risks. Your surgeon should talk you through them before the operation
so you are prepared for what might happen. Your child’s blood pressure, heartbeat,
breathing, and temperature will be closely monitored during the procedure.

One common problem in any type of surgery is side effects caused by anaesthetics.
It’s fairly common for children to feel nauseous (sick) for a while after the operation.

But some children have an allergic reaction to anaesthetics. This is rare but it can
be serious. You must tell the doctor before the operation if your child has any allergies.

Common problems that can happen after surgery to insert grommets include:



earache for a while after the operation. Rarely, the earache can last the whole time
that the grommets are in place



discharge: it’s common to have some oozing from their ear (a discharge) for a while
after the operation



infection: antibiotic drops usually clear up any infection that can happen around
where the grommets were put in. Infected tubes can sometimes become blocked and might
need to be removed



problems with the eardrum: grommets can cause minor problems with the eardrum, such
as stiffening. This can slightly affect your child’s hearing, but probably not enough
that he or she would notice



blocked tubes: grommets sometimes get blocked with dried blood or mucus.


Less-common problems after having grommets fitted include:



bleeding: if your child has his or her adenoids removed at the same time as having
grommets inserted, excess bleeding can happen in the throat. If this happens, your
child will have emergency treatment to stop the bleeding



a lasting hole in the eardrum: the hole in your child’s eardrum might not heal once
the grommet falls out. This is called a perforation. Your child might need surgery to close the hole. But your doctor will probably advise
that you wait to see if the hole heals on its own first



scarring: grommets can sometimes scar children’s eardrums. This can cause some hearing
damage



slipped grommets: grommets can slip out of position into your child’s middle ear,
perhaps because the hole made was too large. If this happens, your child will need
an operation to remove the grommet



build-up of skin in the ear: if your child gets an infection in the ear, a lump of
skin can build up there. Doctors call this cholesteatoma. The lump can damage parts of the ear nearby. If this happens your child will need
surgery to remove the cholesteatoma.



What can I expect afterwards?
Your child might be sleepy for a while after the operation because of the anaesthetic.
He or she will be carefully monitored for a few hours and encouraged to eat and drink.

Most children go home the same day and recover quickly. There is usually no need to
keep your child off school.

Your child’s hearing might improve straight away. Some children are startled by everyday
noises after having grommets put in.

If your child’s ear bled during the operation, the blood can block the grommet, so
your child’s hearing may not improve until a few days later.

Doctors used to suggest that children with grommets fitted should wear ear plugs while
swimming or while having a bath or shower. But if everything is fine at your child’s
follow-up appointment, there’s no need to do this.

Flying shouldn’t cause any pain as the grommet makes the air pressure equal between
the middle ear and the outer ear.

Most grommets fall out after 6-12 months. The grommets are small and children may
not notice them drop out. The hole in their eardrum usually closes within 3-4 weeks
of the grommets falling out.

If the grommets don’t fall out by themselves, they will be removed in an operation
after a few years.

By the time the grommets fall out or are removed, your child’s hearing might be back
to normal, because the fluid in their ear might have cleared up.

Unfortunately, some children get glue ear again and need to have another operation
a few years after the first. But they should eventually grow out of it."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1454680085607/Graves%E2%80%99%20disease,Graves’ disease,"Graves’ disease Last published: Jun 23, 2020
Graves’ disease is one of the most common causes of an overactive thyroid gland. It
can cause symptoms including weight loss, sensitivity to heat, and eye problems. But
there are several treatments that can help.

You can use our information to talk to your doctor about which treatments are best
for you.

What is Graves’ disease?
Graves’ disease is a condition that causes your thyroid gland to become overactive. Your thyroid gland is in your neck. It makes hormones that control
the amount of energy your body uses.

Graves’ disease is caused by a problem with your immune system. Your immune system usually protects you from disease by attacking bacteria and viruses.

But if you have Graves’ disease your immune system attacks your thyroid gland. This
causes your thyroid gland to make larger amounts of hormones.

You are more likely to get Graves' disease if you are a woman or if you smoke.
What are the symptoms?
Graves’ disease makes your thyroid produce extra hormones, which causes symptoms including:




feeling uncomfortable in heat, even at temperatures than would normally bother you


increased sweating


losing weight without trying


palpitations, when you’re very aware of your heartbeat


having a faster heartbeat than usual


shaking


swelling in your neck (a goitre)



red, bulging, or watery eyes (a condition called Graves’ ophthalmopathy)



feeling irritable, and


sleep problems.


Graves’ disease can cause more serious problems if it’s not treated, especially in
older people. These problems include an irregular heartbeat or muscle weakness.

Rarely, an overactive thyroid can lead to a serious problem called a thyroid storm. It causes:



a very fast heartbeat


a fever


dehydration


a yellow tinge to the skin (jaundice), and


confusion and, rarely, hallucinations.


What treatments are available?
There are several treatments for Graves’ disease. Your doctor will encourage you to
think about which type of treatment best fits in with your preferences and your life.

The aim of treatment is to get your levels of thyroid hormones back to normal.
The first treatment your doctor might recommend is drugs called beta blockers or calcium channel blockers. These medications don't actually treat your thyroid. But they can help you to feel
better until other treatments can get your hormones back under control.

Radioactive iodine
A common option for an overactive thyroid is radioactive iodine. It's a one-off treatment, which you take as a drink or a capsule.

Even though the amount of radiation involved is very small, this treatment isn’t suitable
for women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, and it's not usually recommended in young children.

Radioactive iodine treatment can work well, but it often shrinks the thyroid gland
too much. This means that the thyroid gland can’t make enough hormones.

If this happens you’ll need to take pills for the rest of your life to replace the
hormones your body can’t make.

This treatment can cause other side effects in some people, including irritated eyes, a sore throat, or a rash. Your doctor should
discuss the side effects with you before you have these treatments.

Antithyroid drugs
Instead of having radioactive iodine treatment, some people choose to take antithyroid drugs for the long term. Other people may take these drugs for a shorter time to regulate
their thyroid before going on to have other treatments.

Antithyroid drugs have some unpleasant side effects in some people.
For example, about 10 in 100 people get a rash. The drugs can also stop your immune system from working as well as it normally does,
so it’s important to tell your doctor about any infections you get, especially sore
throats or a fever.

Surgery
Most people with Graves' disease don't need surgery. But it's sometimes recommended
for:



women in the second trimester of pregnancy


children, and


people with a very large swelling on their neck (a goitre).


If you are going to have surgery you’ll need to take antithyroid drugs for a week
or so to prepare your thyroid gland.

The surgeon will probably remove most or all of your thyroid gland. So you’ll need
to take hormones as tablets afterwards.

Like all surgery, the operation carries some risks. For example, there’s a chance that the surgeon could accidentally damage the nerves
in your neck that control your vocal cords.

This can make it difficult or even impossible to talk. If this happens, you’ll need
speech therapy. This happens to about 1 in every 100 people who have this operation.

There’s also a chance of damaging the glands behind your thyroid that help regulate
your body’s calcium levels. If you get this problem you’ll need to take calcium supplements
for the rest of your life. This happens to about 2 in every 100 people.

If you’re at risk of getting eye problems from Graves' disease, your doctor might
suggest taking drugs called corticosteroids (often just called steroids) to help reduce the risk.

These drugs help reduce inflammation (swelling) and the problems it can cause.
Treatments for children
Most treatments for adults with Graves' disease are also considered safe for children.
But radioactive iodine is not usually recommended for very young children.

If your child has Graves' disease, your doctor should discuss all the available treatments
with you, as well as any possible side effects.

Treatments for pregnant women
Not all treatments for Graves' disease are considered safe for pregnant women.
For example, pregnant women should not have treatment with radioactive iodine.
Pregnant women can usually have antithyroid drugs. But the doses will be lower than
for other adults. The drugs you can have will also depend on what stage your pregnancy
is at. This is because some drugs are only safe in the early stages of pregnancy.

If you have Graves' disease while pregnant your doctor should monitor your treatment
closely through your pregnancy.

What to expect in the future?
Treatment works well for most people, but there’s a good chance that you’ll need more
treatment in future.

If you choose radioactive iodine or surgery, your thyroid should no longer be over-active. But there's a strong chance that your
thyroid level will now be too low. So you might need to take hormone pills.

If you choose long-term antithyroid drugs, there's a chance that your thyroid level will normalise on its own after a year
or two. But about half of people will still have an overactive thyroid and will need
to keep taking antithyroid drugs, or else choose another form of treatment.

Most people who get eye problems caused by an overactive thyroid find that these problems go away after treatment.
However, some people get more serious eye problems that need specialist treatment.


Some people with Graves’ disease get an abnormal heartbeat, called atrial fibrillation. This is more likely in older people. If this happens your doctor might recommend
drugs to prevent blood clots and guard against the chance of a heart attack or stroke."

Gout can be very painful. But most gout attacks go away within 10 days, even without
treatment. Treatments can help with pain and may cut your chances of having more attacks.
What is gout?
Gout causes bad pain and swelling in your joints. It happens when you get a lot of
a chemical called urate in your blood. Urate is made in the body when you digest certain
foods. It's usually harmless. But in some people, it builds up and forms crystals.
The crystals can collect in your joints, causing swelling and pain.

Not everyone with high levels of urate gets gout. But the more urate you have, the
more likely you are to get gout.

These are some of the things linked to too much urate in the blood:


Drinking too much alcohol, especially beer


Eating a lot of certain foods, especially red meat and shellfish


Being very overweight (obese)


Some illnesses, including heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol


Some medicines, including diuretics and daily aspirin.


What are the symptoms?
You get bad pain in one of your joints. It comes on suddenly, over a few hours, often
during the night. The pain may wake you up. Even the weight of bedclothes over a joint
with gout can be painful.

You are most likely to get gout in your big toe. Other joints that may be affected
include other joints in your foot, ankle, knee, wrist, finger, and elbow.

A joint with gout usually swells up. The skin around it may look red and shiny. It
may feel stiff and warm to touch. The pain will be worse if you bump the joint.

Urate crystals can also form under the skin on your hands, knees, wrists, elbows,
or ears. They look like white bumps. Doctors call these bumps tophi.

Your doctor may diagnose gout by examining you and asking about your symptoms. Your
doctor may take a sample of fluid from your joint to look for urate crystals, although
this is not always needed.

You may also need a blood test to check how much urate you have in your blood. However,
you won't usually have this until after your symptoms have gone away, because urate
levels are often normal during an attack of gout.

What treatments work?
Several medicines are used to treat and prevent attacks of gout. And there are some
things you can try yourself.

Things you can do for yourself
It may help to put an ice pack around the painful joint. You can make an ice pack
by wrapping a bag of frozen peas in a tea towel. To keep the bedclothes off your joint
at night, make a protective cover for your joint (from a cardboard box, for example).


You are more likely to get gout if you eat certain foods or drink a lot of beer. Changing
what you eat and drink may help prevent more attacks of gout. Things that can help
prevent attacks of gout include:



losing weight (if you're overweight)


eating less seafood


drinking less alcohol, and


consuming more dairy products.


Medicines to treat gout attacks
You may be given painkillers called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to control the pain. They can cause bleeding, especially at high doses. You might
need another medicine alongside them, to protect your stomach from bleeding.

A medicine called colchicine has been used for many years to treat gout. Your doctor may prescribe it if you can’t
take NSAIDs. It is likely to work, but it doesn't work for everyone.

Many people who take it get vomiting and diarrhoea. You can't take high doses of colchicine
for long, because it can cause dangerous side effects.

If you can't take other medicines, your doctor may prescribe a short course of corticosteroid tablets, or a corticosteroid injection into the inflamed joint.

Medicines to prevent gout
These medicines reduce the amount of urate in your body. They are called urate-lowering
drugs. They can help reduce the chance of another attack of gout.

Once you have started, you may need to keep taking these medicines for life. If you
stop them, you are likely to get another attack of gout.

Before you start, you may want to think about how much your gout bothers you, how
often you get attacks, and whether you are prepared to keep taking tablets every day.

There are several different urate-lowering drugs. Like all medicines, they can cause
side effects in some people. Your doctor should explain to you carefully how you should
take these medicines, and what side effects they might cause.

Tell your doctor if you have side effects. If one medication causes you problems,
you might be able to switch to another.

What will happen to me?
Your gout attack should go away in about 10 days. Some people get only one attack
of gout in their lives. But most people who've had one attack get more.

A few people get frequent attacks of gout. This is sometimes called chronic gouty
arthritis. It's not very common. The symptoms are the same as for normal gout, but
you get them more often. If you get frequent attacks of gout, the urate crystals can
damage your joints. This makes them feel stiff."

https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1551509923211/Gonorrhoea,Gonorrhoea,"Gonorrhoea Last published: Dec 16, 2020
Gonorrhoea is an infection that is passed from person to person during sex. It can
cause serious health problems. But it is often easy to treat. Practising 'safe sex'
will help protect you from getting it.

You can use our information to talk to your doctor about what treatments are best
for you.

What is gonorrhoea?
Gonorrhoea is an infection caused by bacteria called Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The bacteria can pass from person to person during sex.


In women gonorrhoea usually affects the neck of the womb (the cervix) or the tube
that carries urine from the bladder to the outside (the urethra), or both.



In men it most often affects the tube that carries urine out from the bladder (the
urethra).



The infection can be passed on by oral sex and anal sex as well as by vaginal sex.
So it can also affect the throat and rectum as well as the genitals.



Touching your eyes after touching infected fluid from your genitals can lead to eye
infection. This is called gonococcal conjunctivitis.



Sometimes gonorrhoea can spread into other parts of your body, which can cause serious
complications.

Newborn babies can get eye infections if gonorrhoea is passed to them during childbirth.
This can cause blindness if it's not treated with antibiotics.

What are the symptoms?
Many women who get gonorrhoea have no symptoms. But men usually get some signs that
they have been infected.

If you're a woman you might get:


a yellow or greenish discharge from your vagina


burning pain when you urinate


pain in your lower abdomen


bleeding between your periods (this is rare).


If you're a man you might get:


burning pain when you urinate


a need to urinate more often than usual


fluid or pus coming out of your penis (often leaving a yellow or yellow-green spot
on your underwear)



sore testicles


redness or soreness at the tip of your penis.


You might get a sore throat if you have gonorrhoea in your throat. And if the infection
is in your rectum you might have pain, itching, or discharge there.

If you think you might have gonorrhoea, or any sexually transmitted infection, you
should see your doctor or go to your local sexual health clinic as soon as possible.

The doctor or nurse will examine you and take a sample of urine or a swab sample to
test whether you have gonorrhoea. You might get the results of tests straight away,
or in a few days.

If gonorrhoea spreads into your bloodstream you might get painful joints, a rash,
and a fever. Tests will show if your symptoms are caused by gonorrhoea.

If the test shows that you have gonorrhoea, your last sex partner, and any other partners
you've had within the last few months, should be tested for gonorrhoea too.

This is especially important if you have had sex partners who are women, because many
women have no symptoms and may not know that they could be infected.

What treatments work?
If you have gonorrhoea, treatment with antibiotics should get rid of the infection.
Antibiotics are medicines that kill bacteria.

You'll probably have an antibiotic injection as well as an antibiotic tablet to take
at the same time. This is all the treatment that most people need.

But if gonorrhoea has spread to other parts of the body you will need to take antibiotics
for at least a week. You might be given antibiotics through a drip (also called an
intravenous infusion or IV). And you may need to stay in hospital.

Antibiotics don't usually cause serious side effects. But some people feel sick, or
get stomach pain or diarrhoea.

Other things you need to know


If you have gonorrhoea you might also have chlamydia, another infection that spreads
during sex. You might be tested and treated for both infections. Or you might be treated
for both even if you haven't been tested.

This is because it takes some time to get the test results. Doctors worry that some
people might not come back to find out their results, so they treat them straight
away without doing a test. Chlamydia is also treated with antibiotics.



You should not have sex again until you and your partner or partners have finished
treatment for gonorrhoea.



What will happen to me?
If you’re a woman
Gonorrhoea that isn’t treated can spread to your ovaries, womb, or the tubes that
lead from your ovaries to your womb (the fallopian tubes). When this happens it is
called pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).

PID can lead to blocked fallopian tubes, which can make it hard for you to get pregnant.
PID can also lead to an ectopic pregnancy. In an ectopic pregnancy a fertilised egg
starts growing in the fallopian tube.

Ectopic pregnancies are dangerous for the mother. The egg cannot develop into a baby
and usually has to be removed, either using drugs that end the pregnancy or with an
operation.

PID can be treated with antibiotics. The sooner you get treatment, the easier it is
to treat.

If you’re a man
It’s rare for men to get any further problems from gonorrhoea. This is because most
men get symptoms, so they get treatment.

But if you are not treated, gonorrhoea can spread to your testicles and your prostate.
This can be painful. You can also get scar tissue in your urethra, blocking the flow
of urine. This can lead to further infections and possible kidney damage.

What can I do to stop getting gonorrhoea again?
The best way to reduce your risk of getting infected with gonorrhoea again is to always
use condoms during sex."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/3000007/Glomerulonephritis,Glomerulonephritis,"Glomerulonephritis Last published: Aug 06, 2021
If you have glomerulonephritis the parts of your kidneys that filter waste products
from your blood are damaged. Treatments work well for most people but the condition
can sometimes cause long-term kidney problems.
What is glomerulonephritis?
Your kidneys do several important jobs. One of these is to filter waste products from
your blood. The tiny filters that do this are called glomeruli. If they become damaged
this is called glomerulonephritis.

Without treatment glomerulonephritis can eventually lead to serious problems, including
kidney failure and heart problems. Glomerulonephritis can be caused by many things,
including:



infections. Many types of infection can lead to glomerulonephritis. They include throat
infections caused by Streptococcus bacteria (‘strep throat’) that don’t clear up,
chest infections, stomach bugs, hepatitis B and C, endocarditis (bacterial infection
of the heart), HIV, toxaemia (infection that has spread to the blood), syphilis, malaria,
and leprosy



some medicines, including penicillamine (used to treat a condition called Wilson’s
disease); non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen and diclofenac;
and ciclosporin (used to treat several types of arthritis and other conditions that
cause inflammation)



heroin use


conditions that affect the immune system, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE,
often just called lupus) and rheumatoid arthritis. With conditions like these the
body’s immune system, which usually protects against infection, starts to attack some
of the body’s tissues



conditions that affect your metabolism (how your body converts food into energy),
such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and thyroid problems



some types of cancer


some genetic (inherited) conditions, including Alport’s syndrome (which can cause
kidney disease, eye problems, and hearing loss).



In some people, though, the cause of the kidney damage is not clear.
What are the symptoms?
The symptoms of glomerulonephritis can vary depending on how severe the damage is.
People with mild kidney damage may not notice any symptoms, while people with severe
glomerulonephritis may notice that their urine is a dark colour. This is caused by
blood in the urine.

Other symptoms of glomerulonephritis can include:


needing to urinate a lot less than usual


swelling in some parts of the body, often the legs


nausea, loss of appetite, and weight loss


pain in the joints or abdomen


fever. This usually follows a bout of ‘strep throat’


skin rash


jaundice (yellowing of the skin). This can happen if you have glomerulonephritis caused
by hepatitis



shortness of breath.


Diagnosing the problem as early as possible can help reduce damage to your kidneys.
So if you have any of these symptoms see your doctor straight away, especially if
you have more than one of them at the same time.

Tests
If your doctor thinks you may have glomerulonephritis he or she will ask you questions
about your symptoms and your medical history. He or she may also want to examine you
and do some tests.

For example, if your kidneys are damaged this can lead to blood and excess protein
in your urine. A urine test can check for these.

Blood tests can check for many signs of glomerulonephritis, including:


how well your kidneys are working


how well your liver is working. This is an indication that your problems might be
caused by hepatitis



whether there is too much protein in your blood


whether you have too few red blood cells (anaemia). Anaemia can be a sign of several
conditions that can cause glomerulonephritis.



Your doctor might also suggest an imaging test, such as an ultrasound, so that he
or she can check images of your kidneys for any visible damage or swelling.

Your doctor might also suggest a renal biopsy. In this procedure you are given a local
anaesthetic and a small amount of kidney tissue is removed with a needle for testing.
But a biopsy is not usually needed.

What treatments work?
People with mild glomerulonephritis might only need treatment for the condition that is causing the kidney damage. This
is often enough to reverse any kidney damage and keep the kidneys working well.

For example, people with glomerulonephritis caused by a streptococcal throat infection
might only need antibiotics to cure the infection. Kidney function should then return
to normal.

If you have more serious kidney damage you will still need treatment for the condition that has caused the damage. But you
will also need treatment for the kidney damage itself. This could include:



drugs to reduce your blood pressure. High blood pressure is common in people with
glomerulonephritis. Reducing it can help your kidneys to recover and help protect
you against heart problems that can be caused by high blood pressure.



drugs to help your kidneys deal with protein


strong anti-inflammatory drugs called corticosteroids (steroids for short) to reduce
any swelling in the kidneys



drugs called immunosuppressants, which help calm the immune system if you have a condition
where the immune system attacks the body’s tissues.




What will happen?
Most people with glomerulonephritis recover well with treatment but some will go on
to develop chronic (long-term) kidney disease.

You are more likely to make a good recovery if you are diagnosed and treated early
and if your kidney damage is not severe when you are diagnosed.

Even if you are recovering well your doctor will want to monitor you carefully for
a while. So you will need to see your doctor every few weeks for several months to
see how you are doing and to have some tests.

Your doctor is likely to suggest that you are careful about what you eat and drink.
This might mean making changes to your diet so that you don’t consume too much salt
or fat. You may also need to drink less fluid and eat less protein than you used to.


You can discuss your diet and how any changes will affect your life with your doctor."

If you have glaucoma the main nerve behind your eye is damaged by too much pressure
within the eye. This causes poor eyesight. There's no cure for glaucoma but there
are treatments that can slow down the damage or even stop it completely.

We've brought together the best and most up-to-date research about glaucoma to see
what treatments work. You can use our information to talk to your doctor and decide
which treatments are best for you.

Glaucoma can start suddenly or it can happen over a long time. If your eyes quickly
become painful and red, your vision gets blurred, or you notice halos (rings) around
lights, see a doctor right away. You need urgent treatment.

What is glaucoma?
Your eyeballs are filled with fluid. This fluid is constantly passing in and out of
the eyeballs, bringing nutrients to the eye. But if the fluid doesn't leave the eye
as easily as it enters, pressure can build up inside the eye.

This pressure can press on the nerve at the back of your eye. Over time this can damage
the nerve and affect your eyesight. It's also possible to get glaucoma even when the
pressure in your eyes is normal. This may happen if your nerves are very sensitive
to pressure.

There are several types of glaucoma, including one called angle-closure glaucoma.
The one we deal with here is called open-angle glaucoma, which is the most common.

The main difference between these two types is that open-angle glaucoma tends to happen
gradually, while angle-closure glaucoma tends to come on more suddenly. The symptoms
of the two types of conditions differ, as do the treatments.

Angle-closure glaucoma is a medical emergency. You should always seek urgent medical
attention if you have any sudden changes to your sight.

What are the symptoms?
The first symptoms you may have are small blind spots at the edge of your vision.
Without treatment these spots get slowly bigger until you can only see things directly
in front of you.

Some people with severe glaucoma find it hard to see if they move from a light room
to a darker one. Or they find it difficult to judge the height of steps and curbs.
This can cause trips and falls.

Glaucoma affects your eyesight very gradually. Many people don't notice it at first.
You can get glaucoma in one or both of your eyes. It doesn’t cause pain.

What treatments work?
The aim of treatment for glaucoma is to reduce the pressure in the eye. This can be
done using several types of treatment, including eye drops, laser treatment, and surgery.
The type of treatment your doctor suggests may depend on how severely your sight has
been affected.

Preventing glaucoma
The best thing you can do to protect your sight - whether you have glaucoma or not
- is to have your eyes tested regularly. Some people are more at risk than others
of getting glaucoma. These include:



people with a first-degree relative with glaucoma


people of African-Caribbean origin, and


people with eye problems caused by diabetes.


If any of these apply to you, you should take special care to have regular eye tests.
Eye drops
The first treatment most people are likely to be offered is eye drops.
Some people have medical conditions that mean they can't use eye drops. These people
will usually be offered one of the other available treatments right away.

Eye drops for glaucoma can reduce the pressure inside your eyes and stop your sight
getting worse.

There are several types of eye drops for glaucoma, including some containing drugs
called beta blockers, and others containing drugs called prostaglandin analogues.
You may need to try several types before you find one that works for you. Or you may
need to use two types at the same time.

Eye drops can cause side effects in some people. For example, some people get a burning
or stinging feeling in their eyes. Beta-blockers can cause low blood pressure or a
slow heartbeat. You can help reduce side effects by pressing gently on your tear duct
for a minute or two after you put your drops in. This stops too much of the medicine
getting into your bloodstream. Your tear duct is at the inside corner of each eye,
nearest your nose.

If you get side effects, see your doctor.
Laser treatment
If eye drops don't work well enough, you may need to have laser treatment.
Your doctor numbs your eye with a drop of local anaesthetic, then puts a special lens
against your eye. The laser goes through the lens to the tissue that drains fluid
from your eye, allowing the fluid to drain away more effectively. This can help to
reduce the pressure inside your eye.

Surgery
If other treatments don't work, or if your vision is getting worse rapidly, your doctor
may suggest surgery. An operation to lower the pressure in your eye is called a trabeculectomy.
It takes about an hour. It can be done under local anaesthetic (to numb your eye)
or general anaesthetic (which makes you sleep). You'll probably go home the same day.

Surgery seems to work just as well as laser treatment or eye drops. But it has side
effects. For example, you have an increased risk of cataracts. Cataracts turn your
vision cloudy, but they can be treated with surgery.

It's also possible to get a blind spot in the middle of your vision after surgery
for glaucoma. This is rare, and it is more likely to happen to people with severe
glaucoma.

What will happen to me?
Glaucoma is a long-term disease. You'll need treatments and regular check-ups for
the rest of your life. Without treatment, glaucoma would slowly make your eyesight
worse. Over many years, you could even lose your sight. But treatments can help stop
the damage. Most people with glaucoma don't go blind.

The better your eyesight is to start with, the easier it is to protect it. It's also
important that you remember to use your eye drops."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/3000158/Glandular%20fever%20%28infectious%20mononucleosis%29,Glandular fever (infectious mononucleosis),"Glandular fever (infectious mononucleosis) Last published: Dec 06, 2021
Glandular fever is a common infection that usually goes away by itself without treatment.
The symptoms are often mild, although some people are more badly affected than others.
And some people can be left with fatigue (tiredness) that can last for months.

What is infectious mononucleosis?
Infectious mononucleosis is the name doctors give to a group of symptoms (or 'syndrome')
usually caused by infection with the Epstein Barr virus (EBV for short). It's more
commonly known as glandular fever or 'mono'.

Glandular fever can also be caused by other things, including conditions that affect
the body's tissues, reactions to some medicines, and cancer. But these are much less
common.

EBV is often called the 'kissing' disease, as it is most commonly passed on through
saliva.

Glandular fever is usually mild if you get it as a child. Many people have had glandular
fever as a child without knowing what it was. You might just think you had a sore
throat, swollen glands, or were a bit 'run down'.

Symptoms can be more severe as an adult, but they're still not usually serious, and
the illness usually goes away by itself.

Most people who are infected with EBV never get serious symptoms. And once you are
infected with EBV you carry the virus for life without any problems. Worldwide, about
90 in 100 people carry EBV.

What are the symptoms?
The main symptoms of glandular fever caused by EBV are:


fever


sore throat, and


swollen glands, usually in the neck.


Some people also have a headache and aching muscles.
The symptoms of glandular fever can vary in how severe they are. They might pass in
a few days or they can go on for a few weeks.

Once these main symptoms pass, you might feel very tired for weeks or even months.
This might mean that you need to take a lot of time off school or work.

A few people with glandular fever develop what's called chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). This happens when the fatigue (extreme tiredness) lasts for more than six months.
In some people this chronic fatigue can last for years.

To find out more about CFS, see our leaflet on Chronic fatigue syndrome.

When glandular fever is caused by something other than EBV, the symptoms tend to be
less severe. But, as with symptoms caused by EBV, they can get better quickly or can
take a long time to improve.

If your symptoms are mild you probably won't need to see a doctor. But people with
severe symptoms might have some tests, including a blood test, to see what has caused
the illness.

Sometimes people have a scan of the abdomen. This can show if your spleen has become
enlarged, which can be a symptom of severe glandular fever.

What treatments work?
Most people with glandular fever don't need any treatment, and the symptoms get better
by themselves. Things you can do to feel less miserable while you recover include:



staying hydrated: drink plenty of fluids (non-alcoholic)


resting as much as you need to


taking paracetamol, aspirin, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such
as ibuprofen if you need to, for fever and pain.



But remember to never give aspirin to children, as it can cause a serious condition called Reye's syndrome.

You should also avoid strenuous physical activity and contact sports for at least
several weeks after you recover. This is because exercise or injury could cause a
swollen spleen to rupture.

Antibiotics will not help with glandular fever, because it is caused by a virus. Antibiotics
only help with infections caused by bacteria.

Severe symptoms
Some people with glandular fever have severe symptoms, which can include trouble breathing
because of swelling in the throat. If you have severe symptoms of glandular fever
you need treatment in hospital.

The usual treatment is drugs called corticosteroids. These are strong anti-inflammatories
that reduce swelling.

If these don't work, you might need to have a procedure to help you breathe. There
are several ways of doing this, including putting a tube into your lungs, or removing
swollen tonsils. But it's very rare for someone to need these treatments.

What will happen?
Most people with mild glandular fever don't even know they have had it. But if you
need to see a doctor, he or she will want to follow up with you for a month or two,
to make sure that you are getting better.

If you have a child or a teenager with glandular fever, you might both need to be
patient: recovering completely can take a while.

The symptom that usually takes the longest to get better is the tiredness that can
follow glandular fever. If it lasts for more than six months, it's classed as chronic
fatigue syndrome. If this happens, talk to your doctor.

Most people recover completely from glandular fever, even if it takes a while for
the fatigue to go away.

But the condition can sometimes be life threatening. This can be because of breathing
problems, a ruptured spleen, or complications that affect your blood cells. But these
problems are rare. Your doctor will be able to tell you if you have any of these problems
and how to treat them."

to talk to your doctor about the best treatments for you.

What is giant cell arteritis?
Giant cell arteritis (or GCA for short) is thought to happen when the body’s immune system, which usually protects us from infection, attacks some of our arteries.

Arteries are blood vessels that carry oxygen and nutrients from the heart to where
they are needed in the body.

When the immune system acts in this way, it causes swelling in the lining of these
arteries, which interferes with blood flow. The arteries most often affected are those
in the temples, so that the symptoms of GCA mainly affect the head.

Giant cell arteritis needs urgent treatment.

If you think that you have symptoms of GCA, get medical advice straight away. Without treatment, GCA can cause serious problems, including blindness and having
a stroke.

GCA tends to happen in middle-aged and older people. It rarely affects anyone under
50 years old, and mainly affects people over 70. About 1 or 2 in every 10,000 people
aged over 50 have GCA.

Other things that make you more likely to have GCA include:


having white, northern European ancestry. GCA is rare in people with African ancestry


being a woman. Women are between two and four times more likely than men to get GCA,
especially if they have other blood circulation problems, and



smoking.


What are the symptoms?
The symptoms of GCA can include:


suddenly having frequent headaches


pain and cramping in the jaw and tongue


scalp tenderness


vision problems


fever


fatigue


night sweats, and


weight loss.


Remember: if you suddenly develop frequent severe headaches or problems with your
vision, get medical advice straight away. These things can be signs of several medical conditions that need urgent treatment.

If your doctor thinks that you might have GCA, they will examine you and ask you about
your symptoms. For example, they will probably ask things like:



when the symptoms started


where exactly the pain is, and


whether you have any other medical conditions.


Your doctor might also suggest some tests that can help to show if you have GCA. These
might include:



blood tests


a scan, and


a biopsy, where a small piece of an artery is taken for testing. This is done under
local anaesthetic, so you shouldn’t feel anything.



What treatments are available?
The usual treatment for GCA is medicines called corticosteroids. These are powerful anti-inflammatory drugs that can help to reduce inflammation
(swelling) in the arteries of people who have GCA.

GCA needs urgent treatment. So if your doctor strongly suspects that you have it,
they will recommend that you start treatment with corticosteroids straight away, without
waiting for test results.

Most people with GCA take corticosteroids as tablets. But some people with severe
symptoms, such as problems with vision, need to start treatment with the drugs given
straight into a vein.

The usual treatment method when giving corticosteroids for GCA is:


a high dose to begin with, usually as a tablet


then a lower dose over the next 12 to 24 months. This dose is then gradually reduced
(tapered) down to nothing.



Side effects of corticosteroids
Corticosteroids can cause side effects if taken over a long period, some of which
can be serious. So your doctor should check on you from time to time while you are
taking them. This is helps them to:



check for any side effects, and


see how much you are improving. They can then gradually reduce your medicine to the
dose that does the most good and the least harm. Finally your doctor will reduce your
dose down to nothing.



Side effects of corticosteroids can include:


mood changes and other mental-health symptoms. Unlike some side effects, this can
happen in the short term. So it’s good to be aware that this can happen



developing type 2 diabetes


increased appetite, which can lead to weight gain


feeling tired


being more likely to get infections


indigestion or bleeding from the stomach. If you need to take corticosteroids for
more than a short time, your doctor should prescribe a medicine to help protect your
stomach



raised blood pressure, and


weakened bones. If you need to take corticosteroids for more than a short time your
doctor should prescribe a vitamin D supplement to help keep your bones strong. It’s important to get enough calcium, too. Your doctor
might recommend an extra medicine, called a bisphosphonate, to protect your bones.



If you can’t take corticosteroids for any reason, or if they don’t help your symptoms
enough, your doctor might suggest medicines that help to stop the immune system attacking
your arteries.

These types of medicine are often used to treat other conditions that involve inflammation,
such as rheumatoid arthritis.

They can work well, but they can also affect how well your immune system works against
infection. So your doctor should discuss these effects with you, as well as how to
help protect yourself against infections.

What to expect in the future
The outlook for most people who have treatment for GCA is good. Most people find that
their symptoms clear up with corticosteroids, and treatment usually prevents any vision
loss.

But you will probably need to keep up your treatment for between one and two years.
Many people also find that their symptoms come back after some time, and they need
to have more treatment.

GCA can cause complications. For example, people with GCA are more likely to have
other problems with their blood vessels, and possibly with their heart.

The treatment itself can also cause problems. For example, corticosteroids can cause
problems including type 2 diabetes, and weaker bones, which can lead to fractures.

Regular follow-up appointments with your doctor can help prevent some of these problems."

If you have genital warts you might be embarrassed and upset. But genital warts aren't
usually serious, and there are treatments.

What are genital warts?
Genital warts are bumpy lumps that usually grow near the genitals. But this type of
wart can also grow around your nose or mouth.

Genital warts can be flat or lumpy, look like a cauliflower, or be on a stalk. Warts
on moist skin (such as the skin near the vagina or on the penis) are usually soft
and flesh coloured. Some people have just one wart while others have many.

Genital warts are caused by a virus called the human papillomavirus (HPV for short).
There are nearly 100 types of HPV. Some other types of HPV cause cancer of the cervix
(cervical cancer) in women.

HPV spreads from one person to another by skin contact. The virus can be spread:


if you have sex (including oral sex and anal sex)


if your genitals touch your partner's genital area, even if you do not have sex


if you touch your partner's genital area (for example, with your fingers)


if your partner touches you after touching his or her genitals.


You can be infected with HPV but have no symptoms. So even though you or your partner
might not see any genital warts, the virus can still spread between you.

If you're pregnant
Genital warts sometimes grow larger during pregnancy. This can make passing urine
difficult. If the warts are inside the vagina they can cause problems during birth.
If your doctor thinks your genital warts might cause problems during pregnancy or
childbirth he or she will probably advise you to have them removed before the birth.

If genital warts are blocking your vagina, or if there's a chance that they will bleed
a lot during labour, your doctor might advise you to have a caesarean section to deliver
your baby. But this is rare.

Some treatments for genital warts are safe to use during pregnancy. But your genital
warts might clear up on their own after you have your baby and your immune system
recovers. So if you have genital warts that aren't likely to cause problems during
pregnancy and childbirth it might be worth waiting a while before you decide to have
treatment.

What are the symptoms?
Genital warts often don't cause any symptoms. But they can occasionally cause pain
or itchiness. They may also make it hard to have sex if they block the vagina.

Your doctor will probably decide whether you have genital warts by examining you.
He or she might take a sample of tissue (a biopsy) to make sure that you don't have
anything more serious. Genital warts are almost always benign (non-cancerous).

What treatments work?
Genital warts often clear up by themselves. So if you have genital warts that are
not causing you any trouble you might want to wait to see if they go away without
treatment. But if you are bothered by them there are many treatments that can help.

There is no one treatment that is guaranteed to work for everyone. The type of treatment
that you choose or that your doctor recommends will depend on several things including:



the size and location of the warts.


whether you want to treat the warts yourself or whether you would rather have a doctor
or nurse do it. Some treatments can only be done by a doctor or nurse.



whether your doctor has a lot of experience in using a particular treatment.


Treatments you can use yourself
There are some treatments that you can use yourself at home. You will need to follow
your doctor's advice about how many times and how often you need to use them. You
shouldn't use any of these treatments if you are pregnant.

They can all cause side effects such as itching and irritation. But these will stop
after you stop using the treatment.



Imiquimod is a cream that helps get rid of warts and can reduce the chance that they will come
back.



Podophyllotoxin is a cream or liquid that you put on your genital warts. It works to clear warts
in many people and can reduce the chance of them coming back.



Sinecatechins, also known as Polyphenon E, is an ointment that you put on your genital warts.



Treatments that need to be done by a doctor or nurse


Trichloroacetic acid (TCA) can be used to treat small, moist genital warts. But it doesn't seem to be as effective
as some other treatments at stopping warts from coming back. This needs to be applied
carefully by a doctor or nurse as it can damage normal skin.



Cryotherapy. With this treatment your doctor destroys the warts by freezing them with liquid
nitrogen. This can be painful and may need to be done several times.



Surgery. Some people prefer to have surgery to remove their warts because, unlike with other
treatments, this can be done in one session. It can be used on all kinds of genital
warts and is usually safe for pregnant women.

There are various types of surgery. Some surgeons use a laser to remove the warts,
while other methods include using a mild electrical current to destroy the warts with
heat. Surgery can cause scarring and pain. But the pain should go after a few days.



Can genital warts be prevented?
Using condoms whenever you have sex can reduce your risk of being infected with HPV.
But condoms don't offer complete protection from the virus. That's because HPV spreads
by skin-to-skin contact.

So although some parts of the genitals are protected by a condom, not all the skin
in that area is. Also, it's possible to get the virus on your fingers and spread it
to another person that way.

A vaccine is available to help prevent genital warts. It can also help to protect
against cervical cancer in women. The vaccine is designed to be given to girls or
women between the ages of 9 and 26 as three injections over six months. In some countries
it is also used in boys and men.

The vaccine is widely used in many countries. For example, in the UK it is offered
to all girls aged 12 to 13 to reduce their chance of getting cervical cancer.

What will happen to me?
Genital warts can clear up on their own as your immune system fights off the virus.
But this can take many months or years. If you have a weak immune system you might
not get rid of the warts so easily. For example, you have a weak immune system if
you have HIV or AIDS, or if you've had a transplant or have cancer.

Genital warts often come back several months after you've had treatment to get rid
of them. This is more likely to happen if your immune system is weak."

You might be upset to find out that you have genital herpes. But it isn't usually
a serious illness. For many people genital herpes is nothing more than a nuisance.
If you're one of the few people who get severe symptoms, having treatment can help
relieve them and prevent further outbreaks.

What is genital herpes?
Genital herpes is a common infection caused by the herpes simplex virus.
There are two types of herpes simplex virus. Herpes simplex virus type 2 is the most
common cause of genital herpes, but herpes simplex virus type 1 can cause it, too.
The type 1 virus also often causes cold sores (blisters on your lips and around your
mouth).

Genital herpes spreads through sex. You can catch genital herpes from a sexual partner
even when they have no symptoms, or before they know they have the virus. You can
also get it by receiving oral sex from someone with a cold sore or from someone who
has had a cold sore in the past.

You might not be able to tell you've got genital herpes because it doesn't always
cause symptoms. But you can still pass it on to someone else through sex.

If you are in a long-term relationship, being diagnosed with genital herpes doesn't
necessarily mean that you or your partner has been unfaithful. One of you could have
been carrying a herpes virus for a long time without knowing it.

It's possible to get a more serious illness from the herpes simplex virus, but this
is rare. However, people who have a weak immune system have a greater chance of more
serious problems.

If you have a weak immune system (for example, from HIV or from cancer treatment)
and you get symptoms of herpes simplex infection, see your doctor.

What are the symptoms?
Many people with genital herpes have no symptoms. Others get outbreaks of painful
spots, sores, or blisters in their genital area.

Symptoms are different for different people. You might get one or more of the following:


Itching, tingling, pain, or burning around your genitals


Painful blisters or ulcers on or around your genitals


Painful blisters or ulcers on your thighs or buttocks


Itchy red patches or cracks in and around your genitals


Enlarged lymph nodes in your groin.


You might also have difficulty urinating if you're a woman.
Some people also get a mild fever or headache the first time they have an outbreak
of genital herpes.

Whatever symptoms you get, they will usually be worst the first time you get them.
If you get another outbreak of symptoms it will probably be milder than the first.


What treatments work?
If your symptoms are mild you could try simple treatments to relieve your discomfort,
such as immersing your genitals in a warm, shallow bath (called a sitz bath) and taking pain medicines, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen. You might also try rubbing a pain-relieving gel
called lidocaine on the affected area. These simple treatments might be all the treatment you need.

Antiviral drugs are the main treatment when genital herpes causes more severe symptoms. They can't
get rid of the herpes virus from your body. But they can help your symptoms clear
up more quickly. These medicines usually come as tablets or liquids.

Your doctor might suggest keeping some antiviral drugs at home and taking them as
soon as you feel the symptoms coming on. This can help clear your symptoms more quickly.
You will learn to recognise your early symptoms. The symptoms are different for different
people.

If you have frequent or severe outbreaks of genital herpes symptoms your doctor might
suggest that you take antiviral drugs every day. This can cut down the number of times
you get symptoms and also lower your chance of passing the virus to an uninfected
partner.

Antiviral drugs don't usually cause problems. You might get headaches or feel sick,
but these side effects are usually mild and don't stop people taking their treatment.

If you’re pregnant
Women with genital herpes can pass on the infection to their babies during a vaginal
delivery, whether or not they have genital symptoms at the time.

The chance of this happening is very small, but herpes can make babies dangerously
ill. For this reason doctors often recommend that women with genital herpes take antiviral drugs late in their pregnancy, usually from week 36 until delivery.

If you have an outbreak of genital herpes near your delivery date your doctor might
recommend having your baby by caesarean section to reduce the chance of passing on the infection to your baby.

Picking up the infection for the first time in late pregnancy can be dangerous for
your baby. If your partner has genital herpes and you aren't infected, you should
get advice from a specialist about how to protect yourself and your baby.

What can I do to prevent passing on the infection?


It's important that you tell your sexual partners that you have genital herpes.


You should avoid having sex with an uninfected partner when you have symptoms of genital
herpes, or if you feel symptoms coming on. You are most likely to pass on the infection
during these times.



Consistently using condoms during sex can lower the chance of spreading the infection.




Taking an antiviral drug every day can reduce the chance of you passing genital herpes
on to your uninfected partner. But you still need to use condoms during sex.



None of these precautions or treatments can protect your partner completely.


What will happen to me?
Genital herpes is an infection that you can never get rid of. But most of the time
the virus lives harmlessly inside your body.

Once you've had symptoms for the first time you are likely to have them again. But
the second outbreak of symptoms will probably be milder than the first, and you'll
get better faster. You'll get fewer outbreaks over time, even without any treatment.


Finding out you have genital herpes can be difficult. You might feel shocked, depressed,
or embarrassed. Many people also feel angry. Talk to your doctor if you're having
a hard time coping. He or she might be able to help, or refer you to a support group.

Meeting people who have genital herpes and learning how they cope can be helpful.
Also, bear in mind that genital herpes is very common and anyone who is sexually active
can get it."

Some people feel deeply unhappy living as a person of the gender that they were born.
When these feelings cause constant distress, it’s called gender dysphoria.

Most people with gender dysphoria ‘cross-dress’ some of the time. Others wish to live
and be accepted as the gender of their choice all the time. This can involve having
hormone treatments and, sometimes, surgery.

What is gender dysphoria?
Gender non-conformity
Many people challenge the accepted rules of how the different sexes (genders) should
behave and live at some time in their lives. This is called gender non-conformity.

For these people, the way they see themselves, or how they live their lives, differs
in some ways from how they are expected to be and to live for the gender they were
born, within their culture.

So, for example, they might want to dress in a certain way, or have a job, that isn’t
thought suitable for their sex.

Gender dysphoria is different. It means that someone feels so uncomfortable being
the gender that they were born that it causes them constant distress.

Gender dysphoria and occasional ‘cross-dressing’
Many men with gender dysphoria ‘cross-dress’ some of the time. Doctors call this ‘dual
role transvestism’. But some people with gender dysphoria don’t like the terms ‘transvestism’
and ‘transvestite’, as they see them as insulting.

This type of cross-dressing means wearing the clothes of the opposite sex for part
of the time, in order to enjoy the feeling of being a member of that sex for a while.

There is no sexual side to this type of cross-dressing. For many men with gender dysphoria,
this is as far as they feel the need to go to express this part of who they feel they
are.

More pronounced gender dysphoria
For some people with gender dysphoria, cross-dressing sometimes isn’t enough. They
want to live and be accepted in the gender of their choice all the time. These people
usually feel unhappy having the body of someone of the sex they don’t want to be.

For example, someone with gender dysphoria who was born female might be deeply unhappy
about having breasts. And someone with gender dysphoria who was born male might feel
deeply unhappy about having facial hair.

Some people with gender dysphoria decide that they are so distressed living as they
are, that they want to have treatment to help them feel and look more like the gender
they want to be.

What are the ‘symptoms’ of gender dysphoria?
It might sound strange to talk about symptoms of gender dysphoria, because it’s not
an illness. A better word, which doctors use when they assess whether someone has
gender dysphoria, is criteria.

This just means the things that someone has to be thinking and feeling in order to
have gender dysphoria. So, for a doctor to agree that you have gender dysphoria, you
need to:



have a strong desire to not look like someone of your birth gender, because you don’t
feel comfortable or happy being that gender. This means wanting to look either less
masculine or feminine, possibly to the point of not wanting to have the genitals of
your birth gender.



have a strong desire to look like someone of your chosen gender. This means wanting
to look either more masculine or feminine, possibly to the point of wanting to have
the genitals of your chosen gender.



have a strong desire to be someone of the opposite gender, or at least not of your
birth gender.



have a strong desire to be treated as someone of the opposite gender, or at least
not of your birth gender.



strongly believe that you have the typical feelings and reactions of someone of the
opposite gender, or at least not of your birth gender. In other words, if you were
born male, but you believe that you think and feel like a female. And, if you were
born female, but you believe that you think and feel like a male.



Treatments for gender dysphoria
There are two main treatments that can help people with gender dysphoria:
Hormone treatments. Taking certain hormones can, over time, cause physical and psychological changes
so that you look and feel more like the gender you feel that you are.

Surgery. Having one or more types of surgery can make you look and feel more like your chosen
gender. There are several types of surgery, including surgery:



to create or remove breasts


to change the appearance of the face


to make the thyroid cartilage (‘Adam’s apple’) smaller


to change the genitals from male to female or from female to male.


Some of these treatments involve major changes that cannot be reversed. So making
the right decisions is extremely important for you and for your doctor.

For more information on these treatments, see our leaflets: Gender dysphoria in adults: hormone treatment, and Gender dysphoria in adults: surgery.
For doctors to say that someone has gender dysphoria, and that their feelings are
not just temporary, or that they are not caused by something else:



you need to have had feelings of discomfort about your gender for at least 2 years


your feelings must not be a symptom of a mental-health condition. This doesn’t meant
that if you have a mental-health issue you don’t have gender dysphoria. It just means
that the gender dysphoria must not be caused by the mental-health condition.



Intersex
Some people with gender dysphoria are born physically different from the gender that
they are raised. This could mean that they were born with both male and female sex
organs. Or it could be that their genes are not clearly male or female.

This is often called being ‘intersex’. People born with both male and female sex organs
used to be called ‘hermaphrodite’. But this term is now considered by many people
to be offensive.

But just because someone is intersex does not mean that they have gender dysphoria.
Many intersex people are comfortable being the gender that they have lived as from
birth.

What will happen?
If you have hormone treatment you will have check-ups every few months for the first
year, and every six to 12 months after that, to make sure that the treatment is working
as expected, and to check for other things that can be affected by hormone changes,
such as your cholesterol levels, and your bone strength.

Hormone treatments can cause problems with the heart and blood vessels in some people.
So it’s important that you live as healthy a lifestyle as possible by, for example,
keeping active and not smoking.

It’s worth remembering that waiting times for treatment can be long, usually because
of high demand. But there can be other barriers to treatment. For example, some doctors
are less familiar than others with transgender issues and with how the treatment journey
works.

If you would like to talk to other people about their experiences of transgender issues,
there is a lot of support. For example, in the UK, transunite.co.uk is a directory
of more than 100 local support groups.

Your treatment team might be able to put you in touch with a support group in your
area, or you could search online."

Most people with gender dysphoria ‘cross-dress’ some of the time. Others wish to live

Living as your chosen gender
Many people challenge the accepted rules of how the different sexes (genders) should
behave and live at some time in their lives. This is called gender non-conformity.

Gender dysphoria is different. It means that someone feels so uncomfortable being the sex that they
were born that it causes them constant distress and unhappiness. (For more background
information on gender dysphoria, see our leaflet Gender dysphoria: what is it?)

Some people with gender dysphoria live as their chosen gender without any medical
treatment. Living as their chosen gender might involve changing their name and asking
their friends and colleagues to treat them as someone of their chosen sex.

They might also change their appearance by wearing the clothes of their chosen gender,
or by changing their hair, or wearing make-up. But they don’t wish to make any more
permanent changes.

For some people this isn’t enough. They choose to have treatment that will make a
bigger difference to the way they look and feel. This could mean that they choose
to have hormone treatments.

Taking supplements of the opposite sex hormone to that of your birth gender can make
you look and feel more like your chosen gender. (For more information on hormone treatments,
see our leaflet: Gender dysphoria in adults: hormone treatments.)

Some people with gender dysphoria choose to go further, and to make more permanent
physical changes to help them live as their chosen gender.

This means having what’s called gender reassignment surgery, also known as sex reassignment
surgery.

Many people think of this surgery as meaning genital surgery, and surgery to either
remove or create breasts. But there are several other types of surgery that can change
the appearance of the face and body.

Before you can have any gender reassignment surgery, several things have to happen.
Before surgery
Having gender reassignment surgery is a major decision, and the surgery is extremely
difficult to reverse. So if you choose to have this treatment you will have psychological
support from gender identity specialists.

Your treatment team will help you understand:


what the surgery involves, and


what you can expect from it.


Having gender reassignment surgery is a long process. It starts with a lot of discussions
with your treatment team (although for you, of course, the process of reaching this
discussion will actually have begun years before).

Even if you choose to have surgery, whether you can have it depends on your treatment
team. Apart from anything else, they can be held legally responsible for what happens
to you. So they need to be as sure as possible that surgery is the right choice.

With that in mind, you will need to have changed your gender role and lived as your
chosen gender for at least one year before your team will agree that you should have
surgery. And your team will need to agree that you are happier living as your chosen
sex.

Changing your gender role means:


living as your chosen gender from day to day


changing your name and sex on legal documents


asking your friends, family, and colleagues to treat you as your chosen sex.


Before having most types of gender reassignment surgery, you will first need to have
hormone treatment, usually for one to two years. For this to happen, your treatment
team will first have to agree that hormone treatment is right for you.

Your treatment team will then need to agree that surgery is right for you. This means
that they agree that:



the surgery is medically necessary for you to feel comfortable as someone of your
chosen gender



the surgery will benefit you: for example, it will improve your quality of life.


It might sound like your doctors are making it really hard for you to get the treatment
you feel you need. But they want to be sure that you make the right decisions for
the right reasons. Gender reassignment surgery, and some effects of hormone treatments,
are extremely hard to reverse.

Surgery for people born male
There are several types of surgery that can help people with gender dysphoria who
were born male.

Most people choose only to have surgery that affects their obvious outward appearance,
such as breast surgery. But some people choose to have surgery to change their genitals
from male to female.

Whatever surgery you choose to have, you can discuss it with your treatment team as
much as you need to before deciding whether to go ahead. Your team will give you psychological
support through the whole process.

Breast surgery
You might hear this surgery called breast ‘augmentation’. This involves using implants
to help create feminine-looking breasts.

Genital surgery
This involves forming new female genitals (vulva, clitoris, and labia) from some of
the male genital tissue, and removing the rest of the male genitals, including the
testicles.

Hair removal
Although this is not really surgery, it tends to come under that heading. Hair removal
can be done with electrolysis or with laser treatment.

Electrolysis involves killing individual hairs with heat treatment using a tiny probe.
Some people find it slightly painful.

Laser treatment works by using light from a laser to damage hair follicles and stop
them growing. It only works with dark-coloured hair and light-coloured skin.

Thyroid cartilage (‘Adam’s apple’) surgery
Some people have surgery to make the Adam’s apple look smaller and less masculine.
Some people also have an operation in the same area, called cricothyroid approximation.
This can change the sound of your voice so that it sounds more feminine.

Doctors usually only recommend this operation if other methods of changing the voice,
such as speech therapy, haven’t worked. If you have this operation you will usually
need to have speech therapy afterwards.

Surgery on the face and skull
The medical name for this is craniofacial surgery. It involves surgery to change the
shape of the face and skull. It is complicated and difficult, and doctors only recommend
it after a long period of hormone treatment and when other cosmetic procedures haven’t
worked well enough.

Surgery for people born female
There are several types of surgery that can help people with gender dysphoria who
were born female.

Whatever surgery you choose to have, you can discuss it with your treatment team as
much as you need to before deciding whether to go ahead. Your team will give you psychological
support through the whole process.

Breast surgery
Surgery to change the appearance of the breasts is perhaps the most obvious type of
surgery for people with gender dysphoria who were born female.

Most doctors prefer that you have this surgery after a period of hormone treatment.
Hysterectomy (removal of the womb)
Some people choose to have an operation called a hysterectomy, to remove all or part
of the womb (uterus), and an operation called an oophorectomy, to remove the ovaries.

This is partly because of concerns that hormone therapy can increase the chance of
some cancers. You can talk with your treatment team about any concerns about the risk
of cancer, and about whether this surgery is right for you.

Phalloplasty (surgery to create male genitals)
Phalloplasty is surgery to create a penis. It is complex and sometimes people need
several operations. Most people choose not to have this operation. As with all types
of surgery, you can discuss with your treatment team whether it is right for you.

Surgery on the face and skull
The medical name for this is craniofacial surgery. It involves surgery to change the
shape of the face and skull. It is complicated and difficult, and doctors only recommend
it after a long period of hormone treatment and when other cosmetic procedures haven’t
worked well enough.

What will happen?
If you have hormone treatment you will have check-ups every few months for the first
year, and every six to 12 months after that, to make sure that the treatment is working
as expected, and to check for other things that can be affected by hormone changes,
such as your cholesterol levels, and your bone strength.

Hormone treatments can cause problems with the heart and blood vessels in some people.
So it’s important that you live as healthy a lifestyle as possible by, for example,
keeping active and not smoking.

If you have surgery your ongoing hormone treatment might be more complicated to manage.
So you will need regular follow-up appointments to make sure your hormone levels are
as they should be.

Some people feel deeply unhappy living as a person of the gender that they were born.
When these feelings cause constant distress, it’s called gender dysphoria.

Most people with gender dysphoria ‘cross-dress’ some of the time. Others wish to live
and be accepted as the gender of their choice all the time.

Why hormone treatment?
Many people challenge the accepted rules of how the different sexes (genders) should
behave and live at some time in their lives. This is called gender non-conformity.

Gender dysphoria is different. It means that someone feels so uncomfortable being the gender that
they were born that it causes them constant distress and unhappiness. For more background
information on gender dysphoria, see our leaflet Gender dysphoria: what is it?

Some people seek medical treatment to help them live as their chosen gender. This
can include hormone treatment.

Hormones are substances that help to control most of the major functions in the body.
For example, some of them control growth and others help strengthen the immune system.

Some hormones are linked to gender and to sexual development and behaviour.
The most important ‘female’ hormone is oestrogen. This hormone affects young women’s sexual development during puberty. For example,
among other things it helps with the growth of ovaries and breasts.

The most important ‘male’ hormone is testosterone. It plays a role in men’s sex drive, in the production of sperm, and in the growth
of strong muscles.

Having hormone treatments for gender dysphoria means taking supplements of the opposite
sex hormone to your birth gender. This means that:



if you were born female and you have hormone treatment for gender dysphoria, you will
take testosterone, and



if you were born male and you have hormone treatment for gender dysphoria, you will
take oestrogen.



Hormone treatments can help people with gender dysphoria look and feel more like their
gender of choice. These people usually feel unhappy having the body of someone of
the sex they don’t want to be. For example:



someone with gender dysphoria who was born female might be deeply unhappy about having
breasts, and



someone with gender dysphoria who was born male might feel deeply unhappy about having
facial hair.



Before treatment
Having hormone treatment for gender dysphoria is a major decision, because it can
cause long-term changes in your body. So if you choose to have this treatment you
will have psychological support from gender identity specialists.

Your treatment team will help you understand:


what hormone treatment involves, and


what you can expect from it.


Your team will also need to be certain that the treatment is right for you. For example,
your treatment team might not want you to start hormone treatment until you have changed
gender role. Changing your gender role means:



living as your chosen gender


changing your name and sex on legal documents


asking your friends, family, and colleagues to treat you as your chosen sex.


What does hormone treatment do?
When you have hormone treatment you take the sex hormone of the opposite sex. This:


reduces your levels of the hormones of your birth gender, and


increases your levels of the hormones of your chosen sex.


The result is that you will look and feel more like your chosen gender. These are
the changes that you can expect and roughly how long those changes take.

For people born female taking male hormones
In the first six months of hormone treatment you will notice the beginnings of the
following changes:



Changes in your menstrual periods. Your periods will gradually stop happening altogether.


Increased sexual desire.


You will have more face and body hair. This can take up to five years to happen fully.


Your skin will become more oily. This can cause acne in some people. The full effect
takes a year or two.



You will become more muscular. This takes between two and five years to happen fully.


Your body fat will have more of a male distribution (spread). So you will probably
have less breast and bottom fat, and possibly more around your middle. This takes
between two and five years to happen fully.



You will notice changes in your vagina, such as dryness, burning, and itching. This
takes between one and two years to happen. This can be treated with special moisturisers.



You will notice the following changes starting within the first year:


Your voice will get deeper. This takes a year or two for the full effect.


Enlargement of the clitoris (called clitoromegaly). The full effect takes a year or
two.



You might notice some male pattern hair loss. This only affects some people.


For people born male taking female hormones
Within the first one to three months you will notice the following changes:


You have reduced sexual desire. The full effect takes three to six months.


You will have fewer sudden or ‘random’ erections. The full effect takes three to six
months.



You will notice the following changes in the first three to six months:


Your body fat will have more of a female distribution (spread). So you will probably
have more breast and bottom fat, and possibly less around your middle. This takes
between two and three years to happen fully.



You will become less muscular and less physically strong. The full effect takes a
year or two.



Your skin will become softer and less oily.


Your breasts will develop. The full effect takes two to three years.


Your testicles will become smaller. The full effect takes two to three years.


Within the first six to 12 months you should notice reduced hair growth on your face
and body. The full effect can take several years.

Other effects that take a variable amount of time include:


being less able to get an erection


producing less sperm


more hair growth on your head.


Safety of hormone treatment
Unfortunately, not everyone who wants hormone treatment can have it. This is because
hormone treatment can have side effects that can make some medical conditions worse.

For example, whatever your birth sex, you will probably not be able to have hormone
treatment if you have certain heart or blood-circulation problems. You can talk to
your doctor about whether it is safe for you to have hormone treatment.

Fertility
Before you start hormone treatment you should be given the chance to store your eggs
or sperm. This gives you the chance to have fertility treatment in the future if you
choose to.

What will happen?
If you have hormone treatment you will have check-ups every few months for the first
year, and every six to 12 months after that.

You need these check-ups to make sure that the treatment is working as expected, and
to check for other things that can be affected by hormone changes, such as your cholesterol
levels, and your bone strength.

Hormone treatments can cause problems with the heart and blood vessels in some people.
So it’s important that you live as healthy a lifestyle as possible by, for example,
keeping active and not smoking.

Gallstones are small stones that form in your gallbladder. They can hurt a lot, and
they can sometimes cause more serious problems, such as an infection in your gallbladder.
The usual treatment is an operation to take out your gallbladder.

What is the gallbladder and what are gallstones?
Your gallbladder is a little pouch that sits under your liver. It stores the digestive
juices that your liver makes, called bile. Bile helps your body break down food in
your bowel. Your liver makes bile all the time. But it only goes into your bowel when
you eat or drink. The rest of the time it is stored in your gallbladder.

Sometimes bile gets too thick and forms gallstones. Gallstones can be as small as
a grain of sand or as big as a golf ball. You may have just one gallstone or hundreds.

Lots of people have gallstones and don’t know it. In most people, they don't cause
any problems. But sometimes they block the tubes that carry bile. This can cause severe
pain in your abdomen.

You are more likely to get gallstones as you get older. Women get them more often
than men. Other things that increase your chances of getting gallstones are:



being very overweight


being pregnant


losing a lot of weight quickly (for example, after weight-loss surgery), and


having a close family member who has had gallstones.


What are the symptoms?
Most people don't get symptoms from gallstones. Sometimes people only find out they
have them when they have an imaging test for something else.

But if gallstones block a tube carrying bile they can cause bad, steady, cramping
pain. Most people feel it in the upper-right side of their abdomen. Doctors call it
biliary pain or biliary colic.

Your first attack of gallstone pain can be frightening, because it hurts so much.
Usually, painkillers such as paracetamol and ibuprofen don't work for this kind of
pain. Moving around or passing wind doesn't help either. You may also feel sick and
vomit.

The pain often comes on in the evening or at night. And it typically comes on fast,
sometimes after you eat. It usually lasts several hours. With time, the gallstone
may pass, moving into your bowel and out in your stool.

If you have pain that could be caused by gallstones, your doctor will do an imaging
test to check whether gallstones are causing your symptoms. The most common test is
an ultrasound. You may also have blood tests to look for signs of infection and other
problems that could be causing your symptoms.

What treatments work?
The standard treatment for gallstones that are causing pain is an operation to take
out your gallbladder. If you don't want or can't have an operation, other treatments
are sometimes used.

Surgery to take out your gallbladder
This is recommended as the best treatment for most people with painful gallstones.


There are a couple of ways to take out your gallbladder. You may be able to have keyhole surgery (also called laparoscopic surgery) where the surgeon makes several small cuts and
uses a tiny camera and tools to take out your gallbladder.

Or you may need open surgery, where the surgeon makes a larger cut to see directly into your abdomen. Occasionally
surgeons need to switch to open surgery after attempting a keyhole operation.

Keyhole surgery is better for most people. You are likely to recover faster. You may
be able to go home the next day after your operation. If you have open surgery, you
may need several days in hospital.

If gallstones get lodged inside one of the tubes that carries bile from your gallbladder
to your bowel, you will need extra treatment to remove the stones.

This is done through a device called an endoscope, which is put in your mouth and
down into your digestive tract to reach the stones. This is usually followed by surgery
to remove your gallbladder.

Lots of people have surgery to remove their gallbladder, and most of these operations
are successful.

But all operations have some risks. You might have an allergic reaction to the anaesthetic,
or get an infection in your wound. Some people have problems with bleeding during
or after surgery. Very few people die during surgery.

You can live a healthy life without your gallbladder. After you have had your gallbladder
taken out, your body still makes digestive juices. But they go straight into the bowel
instead of being stored in the gallbladder first.

This can affect your digestion, although it doesn’t usually cause serious problems.
Some people find they pass stools more often than before. They might also sometimes
need medicine for diarrhoea.

Other treatments
The best treatment for painful gallstones is surgery. But some people can’t have surgery
because of medical problems, such as trouble with their heart. And some people just
don't want to have surgery.

In these instances, doctors sometimes prescribe tablets to try to dissolve the gallstones.
However, this treatment isn't suitable for everyone. It can also cause side effects,
and new gallstones may form after treatment is stopped.

What will happen to me?
If you’ve had an attack of painful gallstones your doctor will probably recommend
that you have surgery to remove your gallbladder. This will prevent future attacks
as well as more serious problems, such as an infected gallbladder or a hole in your
gallbladder.

Although these problems aren't common, they are worth considering when you're deciding
on treatment. Your doctor can help you decide what is best for you."

If your nail is thick and looks white or yellow, it may be infected with fungus. Nail
infections don't look pleasant but they are not serious. There are treatments that
you can use to try to clear up the infection.

What is a fungal nail infection?
Fungal nail infections are caused by fungi that live in warm, damp places, such as
showers and floors around changing rooms.

It's easy to catch a fungal nail infection and many people get them. The sooner you
treat an infection the easier it is to get rid of it.

There are treatments for these infections. But they can take a long time to work -
several months if the infection is bad.

What are the symptoms?
Toenail infections are more common than infections in fingernails. But fingernail
infections may bother people more because of how they look.

An infected nail may look whitish or yellowish and may be raised up from the finger
or toe. The skin around your nail may turn red. Sometimes the nail lifts off altogether.
If the infection is severe, the nail may be crumbly. A severe toenail infection can
sometimes spread to the sides and sole of the foot.

If you've had an infection for a long time it may be painful. If you have a badly
infected toe it may be difficult to walk.

Things that make you more likely to get fungal nail infections include having diabetes
or a condition that causes a weak immune system. The infection can also be more serious
if you have one of these conditions. So it's important to see your doctor as soon
as possible if you think you have a nail infection.

What treatments work?
We've focused on the research for fungal toenail infections. These infections are
the most common type and can be more difficult to treat than infections of the fingernails.

Tablets
Most people with fungal nail infections need to take tablets called antifungals. You
will need a prescription from your doctor for these.

You'll probably need to take the tablets for at least several weeks, and possibly
for several months. How long you need to take them will depend on how severe the infection
is and on which tablets your doctor prescribes.

The tablets won't change the way your nail looks in the short term. They kill the
fungus so that the nail can grow back normally. But it takes months for a nail to
grow back fully, so you won't see results straight away.

Antifungal tablets can cause side effects in some people, including diarrhoea or a
rash. But these problems are usually mild.

Serious side effects are rare but you need to know about them. Some antifungal tablets
can cause liver problems. If you take them you'll need regular blood tests to make
sure your liver is working properly. You should call your doctor straight away if
you get nausea, vomiting, fatigue, abdominal pain, or dark-coloured urine.

There is also a very small risk of heart problems. Call your doctor straight away
if you have any of these symptoms: trouble catching your breath, a cough, feeling
weak, feeling very tired, feeling confused, weight gain, or swelling in your legs
or feet.

Creams, lotions, and varnish
If your infection is not severe you can try an antifungal lotion or varnish on your
nails. These are called topical treatments. They don't work as well as tablets for
fungal infections. But many people prefer these topical treatments because there are
fewer side effects than with tablets, although they can cause some itching, swelling,
and burning around the nail.

You may be able to buy some topical treatments from a pharmacy without a prescription.
But for the strongest versions you will probably need a prescription.

Some of these topical treatments need to be applied once or twice a day, and others
several times a week. You'll probably need to use the treatment for at least several
weeks, and sometimes for much longer. Toenails usually take longer to treat than fingernails.


Things you can do to prevent infection
There are some things you can do to reduce your chances of getting a fungal infection
in your nails.

Keeping your feet and hands clean and dry is the best protection. You can also:


take off your shoes when you're at home, to let the air get to your feet


wear shoes made from leather or canvas rather than plastic


make sure your shoes fit well


avoid borrowing other people's shoes


change your socks every day, especially when it's warm


dry your feet well after washing, especially after using communal changing areas


avoid walking barefoot in public areas, such as around swimming pools or gyms. Wear
flip-flops or sandals



avoid borrowing other people's towels.


What will happen to me?
Treatment takes time. If your nail has come off, it won't grow back until after the
infection has gone away. For some people it can take as long as one year for their
nail to grow back fully.

It is common for fungal nail infections to come back. So you may need to have treatment
again.

If your nail infection doesn't bother you, you may decide not to have it treated.
If you don't have it treated it probably won't affect your health, although it's possible
the infection will get worse."

A food allergy happens when someone’s immune system reacts badly to a specific food.
Reactions can vary from mild, such as itching or sneezing, to severe, such as serious
heart and breathing problems, which can cause death.

You can use our information to talk to your doctor about the best way to prevent and
treat problems caused by food allergies.

What treatments are available?
The treatment you need for an allergic reaction will depend on how severe your symptoms
are.

If you are having a severe allergic reaction, or if you are with someone who is, get medical help straight away.

For more background information about food allergy, see our leaflet: Food allergy: what is it?

Mild reactions
For allergic reactions that are not severe, you may just need treatment with allergy
medicatines called antihistamines. Or you may just need to make sure you avoid your specific problem food in future.

If your allergic reaction has involved mild breathing problems, your doctor might
suggest you use an inhaler for a while, similar to those used by people with asthma, until you can breathe normally
again. The medicine in these inhalers helps to open up your airways.

Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
For a severe reaction (called anaphylaxis) you will probably be given injections of epinephrine, which is another name for adrenaline. You are likely to need several injections at regular intervals until your symptoms
improve.

If you have breathing problems caused by swelling in your airway, you might also be
given oxygen.

If your airway is severely constricted (narrowed) you might need to be intubated. This means that a tube carrying oxygen is fed through your mouth into your lungs.

Preventing allergic reactions in the future
If you have had a severe allergic reaction caused by a specific food, it could happen
again unless you avoid the problem food in future. This means avoiding that food and
any foods that have it as an ingredient.

For example, if you are allergic to nuts you need to avoid not just them, but also
foods such as cakes, biscuits, and chocolates that contain them, even in small amounts.

Auto-injectors
To try to prevent serious problems, you might be given two epinephrine auto-injectors. These injectors are about the size of a pen. In fact, you may have heard of them
being called EpiPens, which is the brand name of one type of auto-injector.

You should carry both of these with you at all times, to use in case you accidentally come into contact with your problem food.

Medical staff will show you how to use the injectors. These injectors go out of date
after a while - usually after about 12 to 18 months. Your doctor or nurse will explain
how and when to get new ones.

If the injectors are for a child, your doctor should also work with you to make a personalised written emergency plan for what to do if your child has an allergic reaction.

The main thing you need to do is make sure that you (or your child) don’t eat the
problem food. For example, you will need to:



check food labels and restaurant menus to make sure that your problem food is not listed in the ingredients. This is easier
than it used to be, as many countries now require food manufacturers and restaurants
to list common foods that cause allergic reactions



ask about ingredients when you are not sure. Restaurants should be able to tell you what is in their food:
for example, whether something contains eggs or nuts. If they don’t know and you’re
not sure, it’s best to be cautious



take precautions when preparing food at home. If you are preparing different foods for people with and without allergies, take
care to keep ingredients, bowls and plates, and utensils separate.



What to expect in the future
What happens in the future largely depends on how careful you are about preventing repeated problems, and how prepared you are to deal with them.

Of course, sometimes you can just have bad luck. But there are some important things
you can do, such as:



wear medical identification jewellery, such as bracelets, which carry information about you and your allergy. Depending
on where you live, you might be able to get this for free. Ask your doctor or local
hospital for more information



if you need auto-injectors, make sure you carry them with you at all times, and replace them when you need to



pay careful attention to food labels and restaurant menus


make sure your family is aware of any emergency plans that you have, including using auto-injectors.



Certain groups of people seem to be more likely to have serious and fatal allergic
reactions. These include young people and those with asthma. If you or your child
is in one of these groups, you should be especially careful.

Allergies and nutrition
Making sure you don’t eat food that you are allergic to can cause problems. For example,
by cutting anything that contains your problem food from your diet, you may also be
cutting out important nutrients.

It might help to talk to a nutritionist about how to make sure you can eat healthily while avoiding allergic reactions. Ask
your doctor about how to get help from a nutritionist.

Allergies into adulthood
While it’s not possible to say what will happen to any one person, many children grow
out of their allergies. For example, about 60 in 100 children who are allergic to
milk, eggs, soya, and wheat will not be allergic to these things as adults.

But some allergies, such as those to nuts and seafood, are likely to last throughout
adulthood.

More help
There are many charities and support groups that offer support to people with allergies
of all kinds. For example, in the UK, Allergy UK (allergyuk.org) offers help and information
to people with allergies and their families.

Your doctor might be able to help you find a group where you live, or you could easily
search online."

You can use our information to talk to your doctor about dealing with problems caused

What is a food allergy?
If you have a food allergy your immune system reacts badly to a protein found in a
certain food. This over-reaction by the immune system can lead to problems, which
can vary from mild to life threatening.

If you are having a severe allergic reaction, or if you are with someone who is, get medical help straight away.

For more information on how to prevent and treat allergic reactions to food, see our
leaflet: Food allergy: what treatments are available?
The foods that most commonly cause allergic reactions are:


peanuts


tree nuts (examples include almonds, cashews, Brazil nuts, hazelnuts, pecans, pistachios,
and walnuts)



milk


eggs


fish


shellfish


wheat, and


soya.


Food allergy is more common among people who are generally more sensitive to other
substances. For example, people are more likely to have a food allergy if they have:



a skin condition called atopic dermatitis


sensitivity to certain types of pollen, or


sensitivity to latex (a type of rubber).


Food allergy is more common in children than in adults. This is because many children
grow out of their allergy as they get older. For example:



about 7 in 100 children have a food allergy,


and about 3 or 4 in 100 adults have a food allergy.


What causes food allergy?
We don’t really know what causes food allergy, but in some people it’s likely to be
genetic. This means that some food allergies seem to run in families.

There are other things that are thought to increase the chance of food allergies,
although we don’t know enough to say for sure. These include:



young children not being exposed to bacteria and infections as much as they were many
years ago. The theory is that children’s immune systems don’t become as strong as
they once did, which makes allergies more likely. This is called the hygiene hypothesis


changes in people’s diets. For example, eating omega-3 (found in fish oil) is thought
to have some health benefits, but it may also make allergies more likely



getting too little or too much vitamin D.


What are the symptoms?
The symptoms of a food allergy usually appear between 20 minutes and two hours after
eating the food that you are allergic to. They can vary from mild to extremely severe.

Rarely, the most severe allergic reactions can cause cardiac arrest (when the heart
stops beating) and death.

Food allergy symptoms can affect many different parts of the body. For example:
Skin symptoms (also called dermatological symptoms) can include:



itching


flushing (reddening)


rash (also called urticaria), and



swelling of the skin. This is called angio-oedema.



Breathing symptoms (also called respiratory symptoms) can include:



sneezing


a runny or blocked nose


a metallic taste in the mouth


a hoarse voice


high-pitched breathing sounds (called stridor)



a feeling of choking


swelling in the throat


fast or difficult breathing


wheezing


coughing, or


the skin looking blue (called cyanosis).



Symptoms affecting the stomach and digestive system (also called gastrointestinal symptoms) can include:



nausea


vomiting


stomach


cramps


bloating, and


diarrhoea.


Symptoms affecting the eyes (also called ophthalmic symptoms) can include:



red eyes


watery eyes, and


swelling around the eyes.


Diagnosing allergies
There are several things your doctor can do to find out if you are allergic to a specific
food, including tests, and simply asking you about your symptoms.

One of the first things your doctor might do is to try to find out if you are atopic. This means that you are more sensitive than most people to things that cause allergies.

To do this, your doctor will ask you about other medical conditions that you may have.
For example, people who have atopic conditions such as asthma, hay fever, or atopic
dermatitis are more likely than others to have a food allergy.

If you think you know which food has caused your symptoms, your doctor will ask you
about what happened when you ate it. For example, they might ask:



how much of the food did you eat or drink?


how soon after eating, drinking, touching, or inhaling (breathing in) the food did
your symptoms start?



if your symptoms got better, how long did it take for that to happen?


did your symptoms start after you exercised (some allergic reactions happen this way)?


did you drink any alcohol or take any medicines around the time that you ate the suspect
food? Medicines and alcohol are believed to make an allergic reaction more likely.



Your doctor might also suggest testing for a food allergy. Tests for allergies include:


an IgE blood test. IgE stands for Immunoglobulin E. This can test if you are allergic to specific substances,
and



a skin prick test. This test involves putting a drop of liquid onto your skin. The liquid contains
a small amount of the substance you are thought to be allergic to. The skin is then
gently pricked. If your skin reacts - for example, if you get a slight rash or swelling
- it suggests that you may be allergic to the substance.



What to expect in the future
What happens in the future largely depends on how careful you are about preventing repeated problems, and how prepared you are to deal with them.

Of course, with allergies sometimes you can just have bad luck. But there are some
important things you can do, such as:



wear medical identification jewellery, such as bracelets, which carry information about you and your allergy. Depending
on where you live, you may be able to get this for free. Ask your doctor or local
hospital for more information



if you need adrenaline auto-injectors, make sure you carry them with you at all times, and replace them when you need to



pay careful attention to food labels and restaurant menus


make sure your family is aware of any emergency plans that you have, including using auto-injectors.



Certain groups of people seem to be more likely to have serious and fatal allergic
reactions. These include young people and those with asthma. If you or your child
is in one of these groups, you should be especially careful.

Allergies and nutrition
Making sure you don’t eat food that you are allergic to can cause problems. For example,
by cutting anything that contains your problem food from your diet, you may also be
cutting out important nutrients.

It might help to talk to a nutritionist about how to make sure you can eat healthily while avoiding allergic reactions. Ask

milk, eggs, soya, and wheat will not be allergic to these things as adults.

But some allergies, such as those to nuts and seafood, are likely to last throughout
adulthood.

More help
There are many charities and support groups that offer support to people with allergies
of all kinds. For example, in the UK, Allergy UK (allergyuk.org) offers help and information
to people with allergies and their families.

Flu is caused by a virus. If you catch flu you'll probably feel very ill with a headache,
fever, chills, and aches. But most people get better without needing any treatment.

What is flu?
Flu is an infection of your airways. It's caused by an influenza virus. The symptoms
are similar to those of a cold, but just a lot more severe. Flu is most common in
the late autumn, winter, and early spring.

What are the symptoms?
If you have flu you may get a fever (about 38°C to 40°C), chills, a dry cough, muscle
aches, a headache, and a sore throat. You will probably also feel generally unwell
and very tired.

Flu can make you feel terrible for a few days, but it isn't usually serious. But you
should see a doctor if you get flu if and you are:



an older person


pregnant, or


you have a long-term medical condition, such as heart, lung, or kidney disease, or
diabetes.



You should also see a doctor if you feel very ill, have difficulty breathing, or are
ill for more than a few days. If you have young children and you think they might
have flu, you should take them to see a doctor.

What treatments work?
Most people with flu get better on their own. Usually the best thing to do is to stay
at home, rest, and drink plenty of fluids. Paracetamol can help with aches or fever.
Ibuprofen is another option.

Children can use child versions of these medicines. However, children under 16 should
not take aspirin, as it can cause a rare but serious illness called Reye's syndrome,
which leads to swelling in the liver and brain.

There are medicines to treat flu, called antiviral drugs. But most people don't need
them. Doctors usually reserve them for people who are very ill, or have a greater
chance of becoming very ill from flu. These include older people, very young children,
pregnant women, and people with a long-term medical condition that could make having
flu more serious.

Antivirals work best if they are used within two days of the start of flu symptoms.
People who take one of these medicines get better about a day or two sooner than people
who don't take them. These medicines may also help prevent serious problems (complications),
such as pneumonia.

What will happen to me?
You'll probably feel pretty ill for about one week. And you may cough and feel tired
for a couple of weeks. But most people recover from flu without any problems.

For some people, having flu is more serious. They may get problems such as bronchitis
or pneumonia. This is more likely to happen if you're very young, older than 65, pregnant,
or have another medical problem, such as a lung disease (for example, asthma) or heart
disease.

Should I get a flu vaccine?
A flu vaccine won't help if you have flu. But it can reduce your chance of getting
flu in the future. It's given as an injection or a nasal spray. To be protected you
need to get a new flu vaccine each year, usually in the autumn.

Recommendations on who should get a flu vaccine vary from country to country. In some
countries, such as the US, doctors advise people aged 6 months and older to get an
annual flu vaccine.

In other countries doctors recommend that people have the vaccine if they have an
increased chance of becoming seriously ill from flu. This may include people with
long-term medical conditions, pregnant women, people aged 65 or older, and people
living in a nursing home. People in close contact with those at high risk of becoming
seriously ill from flu may also be advised to get the vaccine.

If you're allergic to eggs, talk to your doctor before getting the vaccine. Eggs are
used to make most flu vaccines and you could have an allergic reaction. You should
also tell your doctor if you've ever had a reaction to the flu vaccine before.

A flu vaccine can't give you flu. You might have a sore arm where the needle went
in or get muscle aches or a mild fever."

We all get aches and pains from time to time. But if you have long-term widespread
pain across your whole body, you may have a condition called fibromyalgia.

There is no cure for fibromyalgia but there are treatments that can help you cope.
With treatment, most people find that their symptoms improve over time.

Various treatments can help with fibromyalgia. These include:


Medicines to help with pain


Gentle exercise


Learning how to improve your sleep


A talking treatment called cognitive behaviour therapy, and


A combinations of some or all of these things.


We’ve described some of the common treatments below. You can use this information
to talk to your doctor about what may be best for you.

The most important thing you can do is to learn all that you can about fibromyalgia. The more you know, the better you will be able to manage your
symptoms. Your doctor should be able to help you find support groups, charities, and
sources of information where you live.

To learn more about the signs and symptoms of fibromyalgia, see our leaflet Fibromyalgia: what is it?
Things you can do for yourself
Exercise may be the last thing you feel like doing. But gentle aerobic exercise, such as walking
or exercising in a warm swimming pool, can help you feel better overall. Exercise
may also make you fitter, which may help you feel better. And it can also help you
to sleep better.

Your doctor should be able to advise you how to exercise in the safest and most helpful
way. Or they may refer you to a physiotherapist, who can help you to find the best
approach for you.

Better sleep quality could help you feel better. For example, it can help you feel less tired, which may
reduce your pain.

There are several other ways to improve your sleep quality:


Go to bed at the same time every day, so that your body gets into the habit of regular
sleep



Avoid napping during the daytime


Make sure your bedroom is cool, comfortable, dark, and quiet


Get out of bed if you can’t fall asleep or you’re not tired


Only go to bed to sleep or have sex, not to watch television or to use a tablet or
smart phone



Don’t eat, drink, or exercise just before you go to bed


Avoid drinking caffeine late in the day


Don’t drink too much alcohol. It may help you get to sleep, but you’ll probably wake
up again and your sleep quality won’t be as good.



Talking treatments
A treatment called cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) aims to help you feel more positive about life, and to give you new ways of
coping with your condition. If you have CBT you meet a therapist regularly to talk
about your outlook on life and help you change negative ways of thinking.

Talking treatments are usually medium- to long-term treatments. And if they work for
you, you can try them again, even after a break.

Many people wonder whether a talking treatment can really make a difference to physical
symptoms like pain. But research suggests that CBT can help people with fibromyalgia
to:



Feel less tired


Feel more positive about life, and


Get on with life (for example, have a social life, enjoy hobbies, or get back to work).


We don’t know exactly how it works. But CBT seems to help some people with fibromyalgia
to sleep better. Better sleep can help you to feel less tired, which may help to reduce
your pain.

Medicines
There are several medicines used to reduce fibromyalgia pain and to help people sleep.
You may need to try several treatments before you find one that helps you.

For example, antidepressant medicines are usually used to treat conditions such as depression and anxiety. But
doctors are learning more about the part they can play in relieving pain. They may
also help you to sleep better.

Like all medicines, antidepressants can cause side effects, including dizziness and drowsiness. Ask your doctor about side effects when you’re
deciding on treatment.

Medicines called gabapentinoids, which are usually used to help people with epilepsy, can also help some people with
fibromyalgia, by calming down the nervous system. These medicines can cause side effects
in some people, including dizziness, sleepiness, and weight gain.

Unfortunately, commonly used painkillers such as paracetamol, aspirin, and ibuprofen
are not helpful for fibromyalgia symptoms.

Alternative treatments
Biofeedback is a technique to help you feel in control of your body. It uses electrical monitoring
equipment to demonstrate how fast your heart is beating (heart rate variability biofeedback)
or how tense your muscles are (electromyograph biofeedback).

The monitoring equipment makes beeps, or flashes lights, to show how much electrical
activity it’s picking up.

You learn to control your heart rate or relax your muscles through breathing and relaxation
exercises. When you do this, the beeps or lights get slower or quieter, so you can
see what effect you are having on your heart or muscles.

Treatments that combine exercise and relaxation, such as yoga and T'ai Chi, can also help with fibromyalgia symptoms."

Everyone gets aches and pains from time to time. But if you have long-term widespread
pain across your whole body, along with other symptoms such as fatigue and problems
with your memory, you may have a condition called fibromyalgia.

There’s no cure for fibromyalgia, but there are treatments that can help. You may
need to try different treatments to see what helps you most.

What is fibromyalgia?
It’s common to get aches and pains, especially if you’re feeling tired and run down
or if you’ve been ill. And many types of pain have a cause that we can pin down.

But for people with fibromyalgia pain becomes a daily experience, even though there’s
no obvious reason for their pain.

We don’t know exactly what causes fibromyalgia. But it's possible that people with
fibromyalgia may have a sensitive central nervous system, so that they feel more pain than other people.

Our nerves send pain signals from around our body to our brain, which makes sense
of them and decides how much importance to give them. It may be that, in fibromyalgia,
something makes the brain too sensitive to these pain signals. So you feel more pain
from everyday sensations than other people do.

Fibromyalgia can sometimes have a specific cause, such as:


A serious infection


Having surgery, or


An emotionally stressful life event.


But in most people there's no clear cause. We do know, though, that certain things
make you more or less likely to get fibromyalgia. For example, fibromyalgia:



Is much more common in women than in men. About 90 in 100 people who get fibromyalgia
are women



Affects about 3 or 4 in every 100 women, but less than 1 in 100 men


Is most common in women between the ages of 20 and 60, with the most common starting
age being 35



Can affect children, but it's less common than in adults, and


Tends to run in families.


What are the symptoms?
The most obvious symptom is long-term pain. People with fibromyalgia feel pain:


All over their body, on both sides, front and back


Above and below their waist, and


As joint pain, muscle pain, or both.


Doctors diagnose fibromyalgia by asking about your pain and examining you. Usually,
doctors don’t diagnose fibromyalgia unless you’ve had widespread pain for three months or more.

There aren't any medical tests for fibromyalgia. But your doctor will probably want
to do some tests, including a blood test, to rule out other possible causes of your
symptoms.

People with fibromyalgia often have other illnesses as well. Most people with fibromyalgia
feel very tired most of the time. This condition is sometimes called chronic fatigue syndrome.

It’s also quite common to have stomach problems, such as:


Diarrhoea


Constipation


Stomach pain, and


Bloating.


This is called irritable bowel syndrome. Some women also have a sensitive, painful bladder, and need to urinate very often.
This condition is called interstitial cystitis.

People with fibromyalgia often have other symptoms, such as:


Finding it hard to get to sleep at night, or finding your sleep unrefreshing


Finding it hard to concentrate and think properly, and


Having memory problems.


Some of these symptoms may be caused by tiredness.
With all these difficulties it’s not surprising that many people with fibromyalgia
become depressed or anxious. People with fibromyalgia are much more likely than other
people to have depression or anxiety.

What to expect in the future?
Most people with fibromyalgia find that their symptoms get better over time. But it
is a long-term condition. You may find your symptoms come and go. You’ll probably
have good days and bad days.

The aim of treatment is to help you manage your symptoms so that you feel less pain
and you are able to get on with your life. To read about treatments, see the leaflet Fibromyalgia: what treatments work?
Although fibromyalgia can make you feel very miserable it may help to know that it’s
not a life-threatening disease. And it’s not a sign of damage to your joints or muscles.
Understanding your pain may help you worry about it less, and this may reduce the
amount of pain you feel."

Fibroids are usually harmless and often don’t cause symptoms. But they can sometimes
cause problems, such as painful or heavy periods.

You can use our information to talk to your doctor and decide which treatments are
right for you.

What are fibroids?
Fibroids are lumps that grow in your womb. But they don't usually cause any problems.
They’re not cancer and they’re very common. As many as 80 in every 100 women have
fibroids.

Fibroids are made of the same cells that form certain kinds of muscles. Fibroids can
be tiny, about the size of a pinhead. Or they can grow to be large, sometimes as big
as a balloon.

We don't know why some women get fibroids. The hormones oestrogen and progestogen
seem to make them grow. When you go through the menopause, your body stops making
so much of these hormones and your fibroids will probably start to shrink.

But it's not as simple as saying that the more of these hormones you have, the more
your fibroids grow. For example, fibroids don't usually grow much when women are pregnant,
even though levels of these hormones are higher.

What are the symptoms?
Most women with fibroids don't get any symptoms from them. So you may not even know
you have fibroids unless your doctor spots them during a routine pelvic exam. But
fibroids can sometimes cause problems, such as:



heavy or painful periods


pain or pressure in your abdomen


bloating in your abdomen


having to pass urine often


constipation


pain during sex


problems getting pregnant or miscarriages (these problems aren't common).


What treatments work?
If you don’t get any symptoms from your fibroids, you probably won’t need to do anything
about them. If your symptoms are mild, you may also prefer to do nothing.

But if your fibroids cause problems that are distressing, or that are interfering
with your life, you should seek treatment.

Several treatments can help with fibroids, including medicines and surgery. What treatments
your doctor recommends will depend on several things, including:



your preferences


what problems your fibroids are causing, and


whether you would like to become pregnant in the future.


Medicines
If your main symptom is periods that are heavy or painful, or both, your doctor may
recommend treatments to help. For example:



A drug called tranexamic acid is sometimes used to reduce heavy bleeding.



Medicines called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can lighten your blood flow and ease your period pain. Naproxen is an NSAID that
is often recommended.



If you're not trying to get pregnant, your doctor may recommend having a contraceptive coil fitted that gradually releases a hormone called levonorgestrel into your womb.

You may hear the coil called an IUD (intrauterine device). This treatment reduces
bleeding for most women. Taking a contraceptive pill might also make your periods lighter.



Although these treatments can help with your symptoms, they probably won't affect
the size and growth of your fibroids.

If your fibroids are causing more serious problems, your doctor may recommend taking
medicines to shrink your fibroids, which should improve your symptoms.

You can’t have these treatments if you’re trying to get pregnant. But once you stop
treatment, you can try to get pregnant again.



GnRH agonists reduce the amount of oestrogen made by your body. This should make your fibroids
smaller. You may also stop having your period.



Antiprogestogens reduce the effect of progestogen in your body, which can help shrink fibroids and
may stop your periods.



Once you stop taking these treatments, your fibroids will regrow and your symptoms
will return.

These treatments can have side effects. You may get symptoms that you would usually
get if you were going through the menopause, like hot flushes.

GnRH agonists also increase your risk of thinning bones (osteoporosis). Some antiprogestogens
can cause a condition called endometrial hyperplasia, which is a thickening of the
lining of the womb.

Because of these side effects, doctors usually recommend that women use these treatments
for only a few months, often before they have surgery to remove their fibroids (see
below).

Doctors also sometimes recommend these treatments to women who are close to the menopause
and will probably need treatment for only a short time.

Other treatments, including surgery
Other treatments, including surgery, can work well to shrink or remove fibroids. There
are several options, including:



surgery to remove just your fibroids (called a myomectomy)



surgery to remove your womb (a hysterectomy), and



a procedure to cut off the blood supply to your fibroids to make them shrink (uterine embolisation).



Of these treatments, only myomectomy is recommended if you wish to become pregnant
in the future.

All operations and procedures have risks, including the chance of bleeding and infection.
Your doctor will explain these to you before you have one of these treatments.

Myomectomy
This surgery removes just your fibroids. You keep your womb so you can still have
children if you wish. But not everyone is suitable for this operation. It depends
on where the fibroids are, how many there are, and how large they are.

There are different ways to do a myomectomy. You may be able to have your fibroids
removed through small cuts in your abdomen with the aid of a tiny camera (keyhole
surgery), through one larger cut (open surgery), or through your vagina (hysteroscopic
myomectomy).

All these operations work well, but you may have a longer recovery time after open
surgery.

Having your fibroids removed should improve your symptoms. It may also improve your
chances of having a baby if you've had difficulty getting pregnant or have had miscarriages
possibly related to your fibroids.

But your fibroids may grow back after a myomectomy. Up to half of women have some
symptoms again five years after their surgery.

Hysterectomy
A hysterectomy removes your entire womb, not just your fibroids. It is a big operation
and you can’t have children afterwards. But there’s no chance that your fibroids will
come back.

As with a myomectomy, there are different ways to do a hysterectomy, including through
a single cut in your abdomen or vagina, or through smaller cuts using keyhole surgery.
Most women have the operation through their vagina.

Uterine embolisation
This treatment cuts off the blood supply to your fibroids to make them shrink.


A small cut is made in your groin so that a thin tube can be put into a large blood
vessel at the top of your leg (your femoral artery).



The tube is threaded through the artery to the small blood vessels that supply blood
to your fibroids.



Tiny beads (about the size of grains of sand) are then injected into these vessels
to block off the blood supply.



Most women who have uterine embolisation say their symptoms improve. But sometimes
the fibroids grow back and women get symptoms again.

Uterine embolisation is a less invasive treatment than a myomectomy or hysterectomy,
and women who have this treatment generally recover and return to their usual activities
more quickly. But they may be more likely to need further treatment later on.

This treatment is not recommended for women who would like to become pregnant in the
future.

What will happen to me?
If you have fibroids that aren't causing problems, you probably don't need any treatment.
But your doctor may recommend that you have an annual examination to check on the
size and growth of your fibroids.

If your fibroids are causing problems, treatments can help.
Fibroids often shrink and stop causing problems after the menopause. But if you continue
to have symptoms - or if you get new bleeding or other problems - be sure to see your
doctor."

Children whose mothers drink alcohol heavily while pregnant can have serious physical
and mental health problems, including birth defects, brain damage, and learning difficulties.

If you think that your child might be affected in this way, there are treatments that
can help. You can use our information to talk with your doctor about what might help
your child the most.

What treatments work?
Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) is a term that covers the various problems
that can affect a child whose mother drank heavily or had problems with alcohol while
pregnant.

You might hear doctors use different terms to describe these problems. For example,
they might talk about:



fetal alcohol syndrome


alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder, and


alcohol-related birth defects.


These terms all mean something slightly different, but they all deal with the damage
caused by alcohol.

There is no cure for FASD, and every child has different needs, strengths, and challenges.
So treatment should be tailored to the needs of each individual child.

With this in mind, children’s needs and the treatments available broadly cover help
with the following areas. You can ask your doctor about any of these treatments if
you think that they might help your child.

Help with school and learning
Children affected by FASD can benefit from programmes designed for children with all
kinds of learning difficulties.

For example, a method called cognitive control therapy is designed to help improve
some of the skills that children need for doing well in school, including:



good body position, movement, and awareness


paying attention, and


making sense of information.


Other programmes help children with learning difficulties to improve their skills
in language and speaking, reading, spelling, and maths.

Children with FASD can struggle to focus for long periods. So some of these programmes
use fun modern technology, such as virtual-reality games, to help with learning and
to teach new skills.

Help with daily life skills
The medical name for the skills you need to lead your daily life is “executive function”.
It covers things like:



paying attention


organising your daily life


keeping track of what you’re doing, and


staying focused.


Some programmes have been developed that focus on these skills in children with learning
difficulties.

Help with social skills
Social skills training has been used with success for children with many issues. It
can help with things like:



dealing with friendships


problem solving


understanding other people’s point of view


communication, and


body language.


Help with ADHD
ADHD stands for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Children with ADHD find
it hard to concentrate, are often overactive, and often act without thinking.

ADHD is common among people with FASD. (For more information, see our leaflets on
ADHD.)

There are various programmes that can help children with ADHD, as well as medications
that can help children to focus and concentrate. You can talk with your doctor about
what might be the best option for your child.

What will happen?
A big part of helping a child with FASD is simply learning about the condition. So
your doctor should give you useful information about how your child is affected, and
about what you can do to understand and to help.

This should include information about:


community services


government and educational support, and


local parent-help groups that provide information and support for children and their
families.



Unfortunately there is no cure for FASD, and children don’t grow out of it or get
better. The outlook for an individual depends on many things, including:



getting an accurate diagnosis as young as possible


how severely he or she affected to begin with


whether treatment is helpful, and


having a home life that is as stable, nurturing, and understanding as possible.


Children and young people with FASD should have a review with their doctor at least
once a year, to check their progress and assess whether they need extra help. Your
doctor will check up on progress and any problems with things like:



movement, speech, and language


education


social skills


behaviour and mental health


drug and alcohol issues


complications of any birth defects.


Many children with FASD do well with the right support and treatment, and there are
success stories. But, for many, life is tough.

Without the right help, most children with FASD struggle to stay in education and
employment. Only about 14 in 100 young adults with FASD live independently. Most live
in institutions or assisted-living settings.

Many young people with FASD find themselves in trouble with the law, and many have
problems with mental health and with alcohol addiction.

There are many organisations and charities that help children with FASD and their
families and carers. For example, in the UK, the National Organisation for Foetal
Alcohol Syndrome (nofas-uk.org) and FASD Network (fasdnetwork.org) both offer information,
support, and resources.

Your doctor might be able to help you find a support group in your area, or you could
search online."

What are fetal alcohol spectrum disorders?
Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) is a term that covers the various problems
that can affect children whose mothers drank heavily or had problems with alcohol
while pregnant.

You might hear doctors use different terms to describe these problems. For example,
they might talk about:



fetal alcohol syndrome


alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder, and


alcohol-related birth defects.


These terms all mean something slightly different, but they all deal with the damage
caused by alcohol. And the treatment for each one focuses on what is best for each
individual child.

How much alcohol is too much?
The simple answer is that we don’t know. Everyone is different. Not every child whose
mother drinks alcohol while pregnant will have problems. And we don’t know whether
there is a “safe” level of drinking during pregnancy.

To be on the safe side, pregnant women are usually advised to drink very little alcohol
while pregnant - no more than one or two small drinks per week - or, better still,
not to drink at all.

How does alcohol harm babies?
Alcohol causes harm because it “crosses the placenta”. That means that it spreads
from the mother’s bloodstream into the part of the womb that nourishes the baby as
it grows. So the alcohol that the mother drinks also affects the baby.

This can cause damage to the baby’s brain and nervous system, which can cause problems
including:



low birth weight


birth defects


unusual facial features


slow growth delays in reaching development milestones, such as walking, talking, and
holding objects



learning difficulties


behaviour problems, and


problems interacting with other people.


The baby can be affected in other ways, too. For example, a pregnant woman who drinks
heavily might be struggling with mental-health problems, and struggling to take care
of herself and to eat properly.

This might mean that the baby doesn’t get the nutrition it needs to grow in a healthy
way.

Problems in older children and adults
As children affected by FASD become teenagers and then adults, they can have a number
of problems. For example, young people and adults with FASD are more likely to struggle
with mental-health problems, such as:



depression




anxiety


psychosis (seeing and hearing things that aren’t there)


learning difficulties, and


personality disorders.


Social problems are also common in people with FASD. For example, if FASD affects
you, you are less likely to stay in education, find and keep a job, and live independently
and take care of yourself.

And you are more likely to have contact with the police, and to abuse drugs and alcohol.
Some people with FASD also have difficulties with social behaviour, friendships, and
relationships. In particular some people struggle with what is and is not appropriate
sexual behaviour.

What are the symptoms?
The symptoms listed here cover all ages from babies through to adults. And they won’t
all affect everyone with FASD. But if your child is affected by FASD, you will probably
recognise several of them. Symptoms of FASD include:



low birth weight - your baby might also have been born preterm (early), which means
before 37 weeks into pregnancy



poor feeding as a baby


being irritable and short tempered as a baby and child


being shorter than average at birth and probably throughout life


a head that is smaller than average


unusual facial features, such as small eyes, a thin upper lip, and a smooth philtrum
(the philtrum is the space between the nose and upper lip). But these features can
often become less noticeable as children grow



fingernails that are small and poorly developed


bent or mis-shapen fingers


being cross-eyed (doctors call this “strabismus”), and


hearing and vision problems.


Some children don’t have any physical symptoms of FASD. But they might be diagnosed
when they see a doctor because of other problems, such as difficulties with learning
or behaviour.

During a discussion about the child’s development, it might become clear that the
mother had issues with alcohol during pregnancy. This helps the doctor to understand
the child’s issues and, hopefully, to recommend treatment.

How is FASD diagnosed?
If you are the mother of a baby or child with suspected FASD, your doctor is going
to ask you some difficult questions about your drinking during pregnancy.

These questions can be hard to face. But it’s important to answer them honestly.
Your doctor is not judging or blaming you. He or she just needs to know as much as
possible about you and your child, so that your child can get the best treatment and
have the best future possible.

Before diagnosing a child with FASD, doctors will look at four specific questions:


Did the child’s mother drink alcohol heavily while pregnant?


Does the child have some of the facial features common in children with FASD?


Does the child show signs of slow or reduced growth?


Does the child show signs of problems with the nervous system: for example, did the
child have a small head when born, or does he or she have problems with reflexes and
lack of coordination?



FASD can also cause problems in some children that you can’t see, such as heart problems.
So your doctor might want to do a test called an electrocardiogram (ECG) to check
your child’s heartbeat.

X-rays and other imaging tests can also check for problems with the bones and muscles
that are common in people with FASD. Your doctor might also want to do some tests
to check if your child has a genetic condition that might be causing his or her symptoms.

Doctors often want to keep an eye on babies born to mothers who had problems with
alcohol during pregnancy, even if the baby has no symptoms. This is because symptoms
often aren’t noticeable until school age.

Moving forward after diagnosis
You might find it upsetting if your child is diagnosed with FASD. And you might have
feelings of guilt or failure.

But the diagnosis can be a positive step. Parents and carers often struggle to understand
a child’s issues for years before a diagnosis makes things clear. A correct diagnosis
can bring relief, and gives parents and carers the chance to:



identify a child’s strengths and weaknesses


praise and promote the child’s strengths while helping with areas where they are less
strong



understand what a child is going through, and


adjust their expectations.


What will happen?
A big part of helping a child with FASD is simply learning about the condition. So
your doctor should give you useful information about how your child is affected, and
about what you can do to understand and to help.

This should include information about:


community services


government and educational support, and


local parent-help groups that provide information and support for children and their
families.



Unfortunately there is no cure for FASD, and children don’t grow out of it or get
better. The outlook for an individual depends on many things, including:



getting an accurate diagnosis as young as possible


how severely he or she affected to begin with


whether treatment is helpful, and


having a home life that is as stable, nurturing, and understanding as possible.


Children and young people with FASD should have a review with their doctor at least
once a year, to check their progress and assess whether they need extra help. Your
doctor will check up on progress and any problems with things like:



movement, speech, and language


education


social skills


behaviour and mental health


drug and alcohol issues


complications of any birth defects.


Many children with FASD do well with the right support and treatment, and there are
success stories. But, for many, life is tough.

Without the right help, most children with FASD struggle to stay in education and
employment. Only about 14 in 100 young adults with FASD live independently. Most live
in institutions or assisted-living settings.

Many young people with FASD find themselves in trouble with the law, and many have
problems with mental health and with alcohol addiction.

There are many organisations and charities that help children with FASD and their
families and carers. For example, in the UK, the National Organisation for Foetal
Alcohol Syndrome (nofas-org.uk) and FASD Network (fasdnetwork.org) both offer information,
support, and resources.

Your doctor might be able to help you find a support group in your area, or you could
search online."

Definitions of fertility problems vary in different countries. But couples are usually
diagnosed as having fertility problems if they have been trying for a baby without
success for between one and two years.

If you're a woman aged over 35 your doctor might suggest some tests and perhaps offer
treatment after as little as six months.

What happens in fertility problems?
For people trying to have a child, facing the possibility of fertility problems can
be very stressful. You might worry that you'll never be able to have a baby.

But fertility problems are common and there are treatments that help many people.
The first thing you and your doctor need to do is try to find out why you are having
problems.

Many things can affect fertility. The treatments you are offered will depend on what's
causing your problems. The most common reasons for fertility problems are that:



the woman is not releasing eggs (ovulating) regularly. The most common cause is a
condition called polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)


the eggs are being released but cannot get from the ovaries to the womb (uterus),
because the fallopian tubes that connect them are blocked or damaged. You might hear this called tubal infertility



the man is not producing enough sperm


the sperm are misshapen and can’t fertilise the eggs


the woman has a condition called endometriosis.



You will have a range of tests to try to find out what the most likely problem is.
But some couples never find out what is causing their infertility.

This doesn't mean that they can't get pregnant. It just means that doctors offer treatment
that may help without being completely sure of the cause of the problem.

What treatments are available?
Treatments for infertility help many women to get pregnant. The treatments you are
offered will depend on what is causing your infertility.

These treatments might include:


medicines


hormone treatments


surgery, or


'assisted conception' treatments such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF).



It's important to remember that not everyone who has fertility treatment gets pregnant.
This means it can be an uncertain and emotionally difficult process that could end
in disappointment.

Bear in mind also that, if you get pregnant, there's still a chance that you might
miscarry. As many as 20 in every 100 couples who get pregnant have a miscarriage.

Treatment for infertility doesn't make a miscarriage less likely. The older the woman,
the greater the chance of miscarriage.

Counselling
Before starting any kind of fertility treatment it's worth pausing to think about
what's involved, and weighing up the strain of some fertility treatments and the risk
of possible side effects against the chances of success.

It might help you to talk with an infertility counsellor. They can help you understand
your options and your chances of success. They can't take away the disappointment
you'll feel if treatment doesn't work for you. But they can offer information and
support.

Medicines to stimulate the ovaries
Women whose infertility is caused by problems with ovulation (often caused by PCOS) are usually offered drugs to encourage ovulation as their first option. The treatment
is called controlled ovarian stimulation.

The first treatment you’re likely to be offered is a medicine called Clomifene. Clomifene
is a tablet that helps you ovulate.

After two, three, or four cycles of treatment with clomifene:


about 70 in 100 women with ovulation problems ovulate and


about 35 in 100 get pregnant. That’s three times as many women getting pregnant as
would have done without treatment.



Clomifene can cause side effects in some women but they're usually not serious and
don't need treatment. They include feeling bloated, puffy, or uncomfortable, having
hot flushes, and gaining weight.

Women who get pregnant after taking clomifene are more likely to have twins. About
10 in 100 women who get pregnant using clomifene will have twins. A small number of
women (less than 1 in 100) have more than two babies.

If you have PCOS you may be offered a medicine called metformin as well as clomifene. It’s normally used to treat diabetes. But it may also help
you ovulate if clomifene alone hasn't helped.

If these drugs don't help you to get pregnant your doctor might suggest other drugs
called aromatase inhibitors.

Hormone injections
Hormone injections can be used for several types of infertility problem.
Doctors often suggest hormone injections for women with ovulation problems if clomifene
and metformin have not worked, or for women who have a condition where you are not
making sufficient hormones (hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism).

You take these injections once a day for up to 12 days, from the start of your menstrual
period. Your doctor will use a scan called an ultrasound to check on how your eggs
are growing.

Hormone injections contain one or both of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinising
hormone (LH). They help you to ovulate. Between 10 in 100 and 30 in 100 women with
PCOS who are treated with hormone injections get pregnant each cycle.

Hormone injections can cause side effects, including one called ovarian hyperstimulation
syndrome (OHSS), which happens when a woman's body over-reacts to the hormones, causing
the ovaries to swell.

About 10 in 100 women get mild side effects such as swelling in the legs or arms,
gaining weight, and feeling bloated. About 1 in 100 women get more serious side effects,
such as:



nausea or vomiting


breathlessness, and


problems with their kidneys or liver.


As with clomifene, taking hormone injections can make you more likely to have twins
or triplets.

Hormone injections are sometimes combined with a treatment called insemination. This means putting sperm directly into the womb, which may increase your chances
of getting pregnant, compared with trying to get pregnant by having sex.

Insemination may help if the man has problems with his sperm: for example, a low sperm
count or sperm that don’t swim well.

IVF and other assisted conception treatments
IVF (in vitro fertilisation) is the most common form of assisted conception fertility
treatment. It can be used for couples with various types of fertility problem, including:



ovulation problems


blocked or damaged fallopian tubes


problems with the man's sperm, and


unexplained infertility.


IVF helps many couples to conceive who otherwise would not. But it’s a demanding treatment,
both physically and emotionally, and it can have major side effects. You need to think
carefully before you go ahead. It may help to talk to a counsellor first.

In IVF the man's sperm is mixed with the woman's eggs in a laboratory. The sperm are
allowed to join with the eggs. Doctors then put back the fertilised eggs (now called
embryos) into the woman's womb (uterus) so that they can grow.

Success rates for IVF vary from country to country. But generally:


for women aged under 35, about 55 in 100 will have a baby at the first attempt


for women aged 36-48, the success rate drops to about 35 in 100


for women aged 40-42, this drops to about 13 in 100, and


for women aged over 42, only about 4 in 100 will have a baby at the first attempt.


Remember that these figures are averages, and your individual chances will depend
on many things, including the clinic where you are having treatment.

Ask your doctor how well IVF works for couples with your particular fertility problem,
in your age group, at this clinic.

Children born through IVF are more likely to be born premature and to have a low birth weight. But this is probably due to the greater number of multiple pregnancies and the older
age of women having IVF.

There is no evidence that babies born after IVF are more likely to have birth defects.
Before having any assisted conception treatment the woman will need to take hormone
injections to control her ovulation. So she may get the side effects that can happen
with hormone treatment.

About 2 in 100 women who have IVF have serious problems that can affect their heart
and circulation, lungs, liver, or kidneys. If any of these problems happen to you,
you may need to go to hospital.

If you get pregnant through IVF you might have more than one baby, because clinics
often put more than one embryo into the womb to give a greater chance of success.
Talk to your doctor about how many embryos will be put into your womb.

Other assisted conception treatments include using donated eggs or sperm. You can discuss these with your doctor if you think they might be suitable for you.

Surgery
There are several types of surgery that can be used to help women with fertility problems.
Doctors usually only suggest surgery when other treatments haven't worked or if surgery
will make it more likely that other treatments will work.

Surgery for ovulation problems
If you have problems with ovulation and medicines haven't worked for you your doctor
might suggest a type of surgery called laparoscopic drilling. With this kind of operation a surgeon makes a series of small holes in your ovaries.
This helps your ovaries release the eggs.

If you're having a test called a laparoscopy to check your ovaries your surgeon may
be able to give you this treatment at the same time. You'll need a general anaesthetic.

If you have PCOS and clomifene hasn't worked, research suggests that laparoscopic
drilling gives you about the same chance of getting pregnant as having hormone injections
or taking metformin.

Laparoscopic drilling isn't done as often as it used to be, as other treatments have
become more successful.

Surgery for blocked or damaged fallopian tubes
For most women with blocked or damaged tubes IVF is the treatment most likely to work.
But if your fallopian tubes are swollen and full of fluid, having surgery to repair
damaged tubes before having IVF can improve your chance of having a baby.

Surgery for problems linked to endometriosis
In endometriosis, cells from the lining of the womb (the endometrium) grow outside
your womb. This can cause scarring and damage and reduce your chances of becoming
pregnant.

If you have surgery for endometriosis the surgeon will take away damaged tissue that
may be preventing you from getting pregnant.

Some research suggests that this surgery can help some women get pregnant. But there
is uncertainty about how well it works. As other treatments, such as IVF, become more
successful, surgery for endometriosis might become less widely used.

Some women have both surgery and IVF in the hope that the surgery will make the IVF
more likely to work.

As with all types of surgery, these procedures carry risks: for example, having a
reaction to the anaesthetic or getting an infection.

Treatments for unexplained infertility
It's hard to say what the best treatments are for infertility that has no clear cause.
The treatments you are offered will depend on your age. But IVF can be as successful
for couples with unexplained fertility as for those with a clear cause.

Controlled ovarian stimulation (medicines to stimulate the ovaries) is sometimes used,
but research suggests that it probably doesn't help. Insemination is often used alongside
medicines to stimulate the ovaries. But it's not clear how well it works.

What to expect in the future
What you decide to do about your fertility problems is a very personal matter. It
will depend on how important it is for you to have a child using your own eggs and
sperm. Some couples are prepared to have far more tests and treatment than others.

Even without treatment, some couples go on to conceive. Every month, about 1 or 2
in every 100 couples with fertility problems become pregnant without any medical treatment.

If you have treatment your chances of success will depend on several things:


Your age (if you are a woman)


The cause of your infertility


The type of treatment you have


The centre where you're treated.


Before you make decisions it’s useful to think what sorts of treatment you would be
prepared to try if the first one doesn’t work. Also, how long are you prepared to
try for?

You and your partner may want to consider other options if treatments don’t work,
such as donor eggs or donor sperm, or adoption.

Discussing how you feel about these options with your partner will help you prepare
for whatever happens in the months to come.

Your fertility clinic should be able to give you more information about these options.
Bear in mind that tests and treatments for infertility can be a strain, physically,
emotionally, and sometimes financially.

Where to get more help
Help and services vary depending on where you live. For example, in the UK, the National
Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has produced information about the
types of fertility treatment couples can expect to be offered, which is available
on its website: nice.org.uk/guidance/cg156/ifp/chapter/About-this-information"

What happens if you have fertility problems?
For people trying to have a child, facing the possibility of fertility problems can
be very stressful. You might worry that you'll never be able to have a baby.

But fertility problems are common and there are treatments that can help. The first
thing you and your doctor need to find out is why you are having problems.

For a woman to get pregnant, several things need to happen at the right time.


The woman has to produce an egg


The man has to produce healthy sperm


The egg has to travel from the woman's ovary into the fallopian tube


The couple have to have sex around the time the egg is released


The sperm have to swim up the vagina and womb (uterus) into the fallopian tube towards
the egg



The egg has to be fertilised by the man's sperm


The fertilised egg has to embed (plant itself) in the woman's womb.


It can take time for couples to achieve a pregnancy. Most couples trying to get pregnant
are successful within a year. But if you have been trying for more than a year without
success, you may have fertility problems.

There are many reasons why a couple may find it hard to get pregnant. One or both
partners may have a problem that doctors can identify with tests.

Sometimes, doctors can't work out why you're finding it hard to get pregnant. This
is called unexplained infertility and it affects about 10 in 100 couples.

Doctors now think that unexplained infertility is probably caused by a small problem
in each partner. On their own the problems wouldn't matter. But if both partners have
something slightly wrong it affects the chance of getting pregnant.

If you have unexplained fertility, you will probably be offered treatment that may
help you both.

Problems getting pregnant: women
Here are the main reasons why women find it hard to get pregnant:


Your ovaries may not be releasing eggs (ovulating) regularly. This is the main problem
for one third of women. One of the most common reasons is a condition called polycystic
ovary syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is caused by an imbalance in your hormones.



About 15 in 100 women who haven't been able to get pregnant have damaged or blocked
fallopian tubes. These are the tubes that connect your ovaries to your womb. If your
tubes are blocked, eggs and sperm won't be able to reach each other to get fertilised.

These blockages are often caused by infections such as pelvic inflammatory disease
(PID), chlamydia, or gonorrhoea. But these infections can usually be treated.



About 5 in 100 women who can't get pregnant have a condition called endometriosis.
This happens when cells from the lining of the womb (the endometrium) start growing
outside the womb, sometimes around the ovaries or fallopian tubes.



A woman's fertility (ability to get pregnant) decreases from the age of 35. It decreases
more quickly once you are over 40.



Some women go through the menopause early. The menopause is when your ovaries stop
releasing eggs. It happens to all women, normally between the ages of 45 and 55. It
can happen earlier in some women.



A small number of women make too little or none of the two hormones that make ovulation
happen. The hormones are called luteinising hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating
hormone (FSH).



Large non-cancerous growths called fibroids may stop a fertilised egg from growing
in the womb.



Problems getting pregnant: men
Most men with fertility problems have one or all of these problems:


Too few sperm (low sperm count)


Abnormally shaped sperm, which are unable to move normally or fertilise an egg.


Sperm that don't swim well.


A normal sperm sample should contain between 20 million and 300 million sperm per
millilitre (mL for short). Half of these should be moving and well formed.

If you have fewer sperm than this you have a low sperm count. This doesn't mean that
you and your partner can't get pregnant. It might just mean that it may take longer.
But some men have very few sperm or none at all.

A low sperm count can be caused by


an imbalance of hormones


previous damage to the testicles


an infection in the testicles, or


your genes.


Some men make sperm but cannot get them into their partner's vagina. This may be because
they cannot get an erection, or because they cannot release sperm (ejaculate) from
their penis.

This could be because there is a blockage in the tubes between their testicles and
penis. Or sperm could be going backwards into the bladder instead of towards the penis.

This can be caused by damage to the nerves. Nerve damage may be caused by several
things, including diabetes or surgery.

How do doctors find out what's causing fertility problems?
If you and your partner haven't been able to have a baby, the first step is to see
your doctor. It helps if you go together.

Your doctor will do a physical examination of both partners, and will do some tests.
You should also be prepared to answer quite a lot of detailed personal questions.

Your doctor will ask:


how long you’ve been trying to get pregnant and how often you have sex


about any previous pregnancies


about any sexually transmitted infections you’ve had in the past


whether you’ve had surgery


what contraception you used and when you stopped using it


about any medicines you are taking


about your general health and lifestyle.


If you are a woman your doctor will ask about your periods, and if you're a man you'll
be asked if you've ever had mumps.

If you’ve been trying for a baby for over a year, you’re likely to be referred to
a specialist. You may be referred after six months of trying if you are a woman over
35, or if you have other health problems that make fertility problems more likely.

First tests for fertility problems
Your doctor will arrange for you both to have tests.
For women, this will be a blood test around day 21 of your menstrual cycle, to see
if you are ovulating normally. The test measures levels of the hormones that are released
when you ovulate.

You may also need blood tests earlier in your menstrual cycle to check hormone levels.


For men, this will be a semen test to see if you have a normal sperm count and if
your sperm look healthy. You will need to give a semen sample, probably in the clinic.

If you are not ovulating normally or if you have problems with your sperm, your doctor
can advise you about treatments that may help.

But if the tests showed you are ovulating normally and there are no problems with
sperm, the woman will probably be advised to have more tests to look for other reasons
why you may be having problems getting pregnant.

Further tests
There are several extra tests that doctors can use to find out more about your infertility,
including more detailed hormone tests. It's important to discuss the advantages and
disadvantages of any medical procedure with your doctor.

A hysterosalpingography is an x-ray that shows the inside of a woman's womb and fallopian tubes. It can check
for blockages or growths. The test can be painful so your doctor may advise you to
take painkillers beforehand.

In the test, the doctor will inject fluid into your womb through your cervix. The
fluid shows up on x-ray, so the doctors can see whether it can flow through your womb
and along your fallopian tubes.

If the tubes are blocked, the fluid will be unable to pass through them.
In a variation on this test, doctors sometimes use an ultrasound probe in your vagina to show images of your womb and fallopian tubes. Instead of x-rays,
the test uses soundwaves (ultrasound).

Sometimes doctors use an ultrasound probe to watch the growth of eggs in the ovaries.


The doctor may want to get a better look at your ovaries, tubes, and womb by carrying
out a laparoscopy. You'll probably need a general anaesthetic. The doctor inserts a tube with a camera
on the end through a small cut in your abdomen.

A laparoscopy can help the doctor see if you have endometriosis, blocked or damaged
tubes, cysts on your ovaries, or fibroids. The doctor can take a sample of tissue
and may be able to remove growths or damaged tissue.

A laparoscopy is a more serious procedure and there’s a small risk of bleeding or
damage to other parts of your body. It may take you a while to recover.

If your other tests are normal you’ll need to decide with your doctor whether to do
this test. You may be able to have treatment without having this test first.

What treatments work?
If your tests show a clear reason for your fertility problems your doctor should be
able to tell you which fertility treatment may give you the best chance of getting
pregnant.

But it’s important to know that there are no guarantees: treatment works for many
people, but not for everyone.

And treatments for fertility problems are not always straightforward. You need to
consider side effects, the emotional strain that treatment can put on you, and perhaps
the cost of treatment.

If there is no clear reason for your fertility problems you may be advised to wait
until you've been trying for a baby for two years. Then you might be offered in vitro
fertilisation (IVF) treatment. Whether you are offered IVF will probably depend on
your age.

The age above which women are not offered IVF varies in different countries. For example,
in the UK, women are not usually offered IVF over the age of 40. The older a woman
gets, the less likely IVF is to be successful.

There are things you can do yourselves to improve your chances of getting pregnant,
whether or not you choose to have treatment:



Maintain a healthy weight. Being overweight or underweight can reduce your chances
of getting pregnant. Ask your doctor if you need to make changes to your weight.



Stop smoking. Men and women who smoke are more likely to have problems getting pregnant,
and more likely to miscarry.



Have sex every two or three days, every week. This increases your chances of not missing
a woman’s fertile time.

A feeding tube can help with several medical conditions when people are unable to
eat normally. It can also be used to remove the stomach contents in situations when
it’s medically necessary.

What is a nasogastric tube?
The technical name for a feeding tube is a nasogastric tube. It’s a thin, flexible
tube that is passed through the nostril and down into your stomach.

It can then be used for one of three things:


making sure you get the nutrition you need if you are not able to eat normally for
any reason





feeding medicine in liquid form directly into the stomach




removing the contents of the stomach when necessary.


Why might I need a feeding tube?
There are various conditions that can affect someone’s ability to eat normally, including:




anorexia




coma




liver disease




problems with the muscles in the throat and oesophagus (the food pipe)




burn injuries, and




injuries to the mouth, head, or neck.


A nasogastric tube is also often used to:


give nutrition after surgery on the stomach or intestine, and




empty the stomach when someone has a bowel obstruction and food cannot pass through
the bowel.



What will happen?
For this procedure you need to be sitting upright with your head tilted slightly downwards.
Your doctor or nurse will help you to get into the right position.

Your doctor will then:


pass the feeding tube into one of your nostrils, and gently feed it back into the
space behind your nose and mouth (this space is called the pharynx) until you can
feel it there





ask you to take a sip of water. This helps you to swallow the tube




ask you to keep taking sips of water until you have completely swallowed the tube






tape the tube to your nose to keep it in place.


What are the risks?
Feeding tubes usually work well. But there can be problems. For example:


the tube can become dislodged if someone is agitated and nervous when it is being
put in place





the tube can cause nosebleeds




poor positioning of the tube can cause someone to breathe food into the lungs, which
can cause an infection





the tube can become blocked with food. If this can’t be flushed out, then a new tube
will have to be put in place.



What can I expect afterwards?
Your doctor might want to do an x-ray to check that the tube is in exactly the right
place. Or he or she might extract a little fluid from your stomach through the tube
to test.

If the tube is in the right place it can stay there for as long as you need it."

Febrile seizures are common in children under 5 years old. Usually they are over quickly,
they don't happen again, and they have no lasting effects (the word febrile just means
feverish).

Seeing your child have a seizure can be frightening. But if it is brief and happens
at the same time as a fever there's usually nothing to worry about.

You can use our information to talk to your doctor and decide which treatments are
best for your child.

What happens?
Febrile seizures are fairly common in babies and young children. They affect up to
5 in 100 young children and are slightly more common in boys than in girls. They are
brief seizures, or fits, which can happen when your child has a fever (a high temperature).

Many illnesses can cause a fever. The fevers that most commonly happen alongside a
febrile seizure come from ear infections and from tonsillitis.

Children can get febrile seizures from when they are a few months old. There are different
types of seizures. This information is about simple febrile seizures.

What are the symptoms?
The symptoms can be alarming. Your child:


might twitch or shake


will lose consciousness (black out)


won't look at you or react to your voice


might foam at the mouth, vomit, or wet or soil themselves.


Most children who have a simple febrile seizure twitch or shake evenly on both sides
of their body. But some children go rigid, holding their arms and legs stiffly.

Either way, the seizure lasts only a couple of minutes. Children often go into a very
deep sleep after a seizure.

Some children have what are called complex febrile seizures. These are more serious than simple febrile seizures. The symptoms of complex febrile
seizures incllude:



severe twitching


a seizure that lasts more than 15 minutes, and


having more than one seizure in 24 hours.


If your child gets these symptoms, seek immediate medical help. Take the child to
hospital or call for an ambulance.

What to do
If your child has a seizure:


check the time. It's useful if you can tell your doctor how long a seizure has lasted.
If it goes on for more than five minutes you should get medical help



for babies, cradle them in your arms, on their side, with their feet slightly higher
than their head



clear away any vomit from your child's mouth to prevent choking. But don't put anything
in your child's mouth



if there is twitching, check whether one or both sides of your child's body twitches.
If one side jerks more, tell the doctor. Try to remember which side.



If it's the first time your child has had a seizure, take them to the doctor or to
hospital, or call for an ambulance.

If your child has had a febrile seizure before, he or she may not need to see a doctor.
But always get medical help if you're worried.

If your child has already had one febrile seizure in the last 24 hours, or if they
have more than one seizure in the space of 24 hours, get medical help.

What treatments work?
Most febrile seizures are over quickly and don't need any treatment.
Most infections that cause the fevers linked to febrile seizures are caused by viruses.
Antibiotics only work on infections caused by bacteria. So antibiotics are probably
not useful.

Medicines are sometimes used to prevent febrile seizures in children who get a lot
of them. But these medicines can cause side effects, such as hyperactivity (being
overactive), tiredness, irritability, and problems with speech, movement, and sleep.

Febrile seizures are related to a fever. If your child has a fever, paracetamol and
ibuprofen can reduce the fever and make him or her feel more comfortable. But they
don't prevent further seizures.

You can buy these drugs as syrups from a chemist. Paracetamol can be used for children
3 months and older and ibuprofen for children 6 months and older. Check the packaging
to see what age group they are suitable for.

Ibuprofen can sometimes cause an upset stomach. Paracetamol is less likely to cause
side effects, but it can cause severe liver damage if your child takes too much. This
can be fatal. Never give your child more than the recommended dose.

Prevention
Making sure children's vaccinations are up to date can help prevent illnesses that
cause a fever. This is important whether they have had a febrile seizure or not.

But if your doctor thinks that your child is at risk of having a febrile seizure,
he or she will want to make especially sure that your child has had the right vaccinations
for his or her age. These might include vaccinations for flu, and for MMR-varicella.

Some people still think that the MMR vaccine can cause autism. This is not true. Not vaccinating
your children is dangerous for them and for other children they come into contact
with.

What will happen?
Your doctor will try to find what caused the infection that caused the seizure. This
might mean taking a urine sample or doing a blood test.

The doctor might want your child to stay in hospital for a short while, just to keep
an eye on him or her. This is more likely if your child is very young.

Your child will also need to go to hospital if the doctor thinks he or she might have
meningitis. Meningitis can sometimes cause a seizure. It's a serious illness but it's
fairly rare in children with febrile seizures.

Children recover completely from a simple febrile seizure. But if your child has had
one seizure there is about a 1 in 3 chance of a second seizure if they have a fever
in future.

Febrile seizures don't cause any problems with children's learning or development.
And most children grow out of them by 5 or 6 years of age.

If a child has a febrile seizure they have a slightly increased chance of getting
epilepsy in later life. Epilepsy is a serious condition where people get repeated
seizures. But it's rare for healthy children who have had a febrile seizure to go
on to have epilepsy. It happens to less than 1 in 100 children."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/3000275/Fatigue%3A%20possible%20causes,Fatigue: possible causes,"Fatigue: possible causes Last published: Jun 07, 2022
Most illnesses can make you feel tired. But here we look at possible causes of long-lasting
fatigue (extreme tiredness) when it is your main or only symptom.

Some conditions that cause extreme tiredness aren’t easy to cure or to treat. But
there are often things that can help. And it often helps people simply to know why
they feel so tired.

You can use our information to talk to your doctor about what might be causing you
to feel tired, and hopefully to get some help.

What is fatigue?
Most of us feel tired at times: for example, around bedtime, or after a long day at
work.

But fatigue in a medical sense means that you feel constantly exhausted, even after
you have slept or rested, over several weeks or months.

It might help to think of it this way: it’s normal to feel tired for a while after
doing a task or activity. But if you constantly feel that you don’t have enough energy
to start a task, that’s what doctors would call fatigue.

Fatigue and medical emergencies
In this leaflet we cover the causes of long-lasting fatigue. Most things that cause
this type of fatigue are not dangerous in the short term.

But there are some problems that can cause you to become very tired quite suddenly,
and which need urgent treatment. These include:



heart problems


stroke


some causes of anaemia


complications of diabetes, and


some infectious diseases, including COVID-19 (coronavirus).


If you think that your fatigue might be a symptom of a serious condition, get medical help straight away.

Diagnosing the cause of fatigue
If you see your doctor about fatigue they will ask you some questions to try to find
out what is causing it. For example, they might ask about:



your medical history and any medical problems that you have now


any medicines you are taking


your mental health: for example, if you feel under stress for any reason, such as
problems at work or with your family



any sleep problems


how long you have had problems with fatigue


whether you always feel tired or if it comes and goes


how much activity you can do before becoming too tired


any other symptoms you have, and


what kind of work you do.


Your doctor might also want to examine you physically. For example, they might listen
to your chest or test for any areas of tenderness.

You might also have tests, including blood tests and scans.
What are the most likely causes of fatigue?
Many health problems can have fatigue as the main or only cause. Here we look briefly
at many of them.

For more detailed information on treatments for conditions that can cause fatigue,
you can see our leaflets that cover most of the specific conditions listed here, including
chronic fatigue syndrome, insomnia, depression, anaemia, coeliac disease, multiple
sclerosis, asthma, COPD, diabetes, and heart failure.

Insomnia and other sleep problems
Sleep problems are common, and can be caused by many things, including:


mental-health problems


some medicines, and


sleep-breathing problems, such as sleep apnoea.


If you are not getting enough sleep it’s not surprising that you will feel very tired
for much of the time. Finding the cause of your sleep problems is important in helping
you get the right treatment.

Depression, stress, and other mental-health problems
Fatigue is common among people with depression, stress, and related mental-health
issues. But the link between them is not always clear.

For example, it’s often hard to say whether someone’s fatigue is caused by depression,
or the other way around. Getting help with mental-health problems could help you to
start to deal with both issues.

Anaemia and other blood conditions
You’ve probably heard the suggestion that if someone is tired they need more iron. This is sometimes true: a common type of anaemia is caused by low iron levels, and
can be treated with iron supplements.

But other conditions that affect the blood, such as lymphoma and leukaemia, can also
cause fatigue. These conditions are not common, but if you see your doctor about fatigue
they will probably advise blood tests, which can rule out these problems.

A very rare cause of fatigue is heavy metal poisoning, where metals such as mercury
and lead get into the blood of people working in certain industries. This is far less
common than it used to be.

Heart disease
It’s not surprising that heart problems should cause fatigue, especially heart failure.
Sudden fatigue, rather than chest pain, can also sometimes be the main symptom of
a heart attack. This seems to be more common in women.

If you think that you have fatigue that is related to heart problems, get medical
help straight away.

Hormone problems
Several problems linked to hormones can cause fatigue. These include:


having an under-active thyroid gland. This is called hypothyroidism


diabetes. You might not think of diabetes as a hormone problem. But people with diabetes don’t
have enough of a hormone called insulin. Fatigue can be one of the early symptoms
of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes



Addison’s disease, where you don’t have enough of certain hormones. You might also hear this called
primary adrenal insufficiency.



Cushing syndrome, where you have too much of a hormone called cortisol.



Some infectious disease
Infections that can have long-lasting fatigue as one of the main symptoms include
Epstein-Barr virus, HIV, COVID-19, and Lyme disease.

Medicines and other substances
Medicines can sometimes cause fatigue. These include:


antihistamines, which are usually used to treat allergies


many drugs for heart problems, including drugs that lower blood pressure or regulate
your heart rhythm



antidepressants


powerful anti-inflammatories called corticosteroids, and


drugs that control nausea (anti-emetics).


Regularly drinking a lot of alcohol, and using some recreational ('street') drugs
can also cause fatigue.

Industrial toxins, such as lead used in paint, are no longer the problem that they
used to be. But some toxins are still linked with fatigue. For example, metal-on-metal
hip implants can leak toxins into the bloodstream.

This type of implant is rarely used now. But if you have fatigue that you think might
be linked to a hip implant, talk to your doctor.

COPD and other lung problems
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, is a common cause of fatigue. But
other problems that affect the lungs can also cause fatigue. These include:



sarcoidosis


asthma, and


pulmonary hypertension (high blood pressure in the blood vessels that supply the lungs).


Stomach and digestive problems
Problems with digestion (called gastro-intestinal problems) can cause fatigue, usually
because they make it hard for you to get enough nutrition. They include:



coeliac disease. You might also hear this called gluten intolerance.


chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis and hepatitis


inflammatory bowel disease, and


irritable bowel syndrome.


Conditions that affect the nervous system
Many conditions that affect how your nervous system works can cause fatigue. Those
that have fatigue as one of the main symptoms include:



multiple sclerosis (MS). Many people with MS say that fatigue is the symptom that
causes them the most difficulty



Parkinson’s disease, and


stroke. Almost half of people who have had a stroke will have problems with fatigue
for months or years afterwards.



Problem that affect the joints
Conditions that can affect your joints, and which can also cause fatigue include:


systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)


fibromyalgia, and


rheumatoid arthritis. Doctors often don’t think of fatigue as one of the main symptoms
of RA. But many people with the condition say that it bothers them a lot.



Cancer
Fatigue is a common symptom of the early stages of cancer. It often happens at the
same time as other symptoms, especially losing weight without trying and depression.

Feeling tired for a few weeks doesn’t mean that you should panic and think that you
have cancer. But if you see your doctor about fatigue, it can help to rule it out.

Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS, myalgic encephalomyelitis, or ME)
CFS/ME is a long-lasting condition with symptoms that can include:


fatigue lasting longer than six months


memory problems


joint pain


headache


not feeling refreshed after sleep, and


feeling exhausted and unwell after even light exercise.


We don’t know what causes CFS, but it often starts after someone has a bad viral infection.
CFS is hard to treat and can last for many years in some people. But it is becoming
more understood, and there is more support available than in the past.

What to expect in the future
Unfortunately, some types of fatigue are hard to treat. And sometimes the cause of
someone’s fatigue can’t be pinned down.

But that doesn’t mean that you have to live with feeling exhausted for long periods.
Many causes of fatigue can be traced back to conditions that can be treated. And treatment
can help get you back to normal.

There are other good reasons to talk to your doctor if you have fatigue. For example,
fatigue could be a sign of something serious that needs treatment. And if it isn’t,
then ruling out serious problems can give you some peace of mind.

It can take time to find out what causes a complex symptom such as fatigue. But talking
to your doctor is a good place to start."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/3000295/Faecal%20incontinence,Faecal incontinence,"Faecal incontinence Last published: Dec 09, 2022
​Faecal incontinence means that you don’t have complete control over when you pass
faeces (empty your bowels) or wind. It can affect your quality of life, and make you
feel embarrassed and socially isolated.

But there are treatments that can help many people. Faecal incontinence can have many
different causes. Treating the cause should help treat the problem.

You can use our information to talk to your doctor about the best treatments for you.
You may feel embarrassed to talk to your doctor. But they will have helped many people
with similar problems.

What is faecal incontinence?
Faecal incontinence means not having complete control over when you pass faeces (empty
your bowels) or when you pass wind.

Many things can cause faecal incontinence, including:


Physical problems in your anus or rectum: for example, problems with the muscles and other tissues



Problems that affect the nervous system. These could be localised problems, or conditions like multiple sclerosis or stroke



Having had pelvic or bowel surgery


Mental health issues


Injuries, such as stretching, that can happen during childbirth


Problems that can affect the consistency of your stool, such as inflammatory bowel disease


Some types of physical disability, and


Getting older.


Faecal incontinence is more common than many people think. It affects up to 10 in
100 adults. That figure could be even higher, as many people don’t like to talk about
it, even to their doctor.

What are the symptoms?
Symptoms of faecal incontinence can vary according to what is causing them. They generally
include:



Passing wind accidentally


Passing liquid faeces accidentally, and


Passing solid faeces accidentally.


If you see your doctor about problems like these, they will ask you questions about
your symptoms, such as how often they happen, and whether they affect your lifestyle
and daily activities.

They will also ask about your medical history. For example, they will probably ask:



When your symptoms started


Whether you have a history of bowel problems, such as inflammatory bowel disease or
constipation



If you have ever had bowel or stomach surgery


If you have any problems with your lower back, and


If you have any medical issues that affect your nervous system, such as multiple sclerosis.


Your doctor will probably also want to do a physical examination. This will probably mean the doctor inserting a finger into your rectum. This can
help to find things like scarring, fistulae (unusual connections between two types
of tissue), lumps, and impacted masses of faeces.

Your doctor might also suggest some tests. These might include:



Scans


Tests on the nerves in your rectum


Blood and stool tests, and


A sigmoidoscopy. This involves inserting a small camera into the rectum to look for problems and
blockages.



If you are a woman who has had children, your doctor will ask you about things that happened during your labour and delivery
that can lead to problems with incontinence, such as:



Whether you had an episiotomy or tearing


Whether your doctor used forceps during delivery


If the second stage of labour was delayed, and


The birth weight of your baby or babies.


What treatments are available?
Faecal incontinence is not really a condition in itself, but a symptom of another
problem - or of more than one problem. So the best way to treat it is to treat those
problems.

First steps
Unless there is an obvious cause of your symptoms that can be easily treated, your
doctor will probably suggest that you begin by thinking about:



Your diet


Your daily bowel habits, and



Ways of coping with your symptoms.



They might suggest that you keep a food diary. This can help you to understand if you are eating a balanced and healthy diet.

It can also highlight any foods that might help to cause bowel problems. For example,
some people might need to reduce the amount of fibre in their diet if their stools
are too loose.

Foods that can make stools loose can include:


Certain fruits and fruit products, including prunes, rhubarb, figs, and fruit juices


Artificial sweeteners


Alcohol


Caffeine, and


Some vegetables, such as beans, broccoli, cauliflower, and cabbage.


On the other hand, some people need to eat more fibre, to make their stools less hard.
Your doctor may also suggest ways of making your bowel movements more regular and
predictable. For example, they might suggest that you try:



Going to the toilet after each meal


Using toilets that are private, comfortable, and accessible, and


Using a sitting or squatting position when you use the toilet, and avoiding straining.


Your doctor should understand that problems with faecal incontinence can affect your
mental health and your ability to socialise and do the things you enjoy.

You should feel free to discuss any such issues with your doctor. And they should
understand how important it is for you to get the help you need. Your doctor may also
be able to advise you about practical things, such as disposable pads (if you need
them), as well as other useful products, and local support groups.

Treatments for loose stools
If your stools are very loose and soft, even after changes to your diet, your doctor
may recommend medicines that are usually used to treat diarrhoea. These can cause
side effects, so your doctor will want to check on you regularly.

Treatments for constipation and overflow
Some people’s symptoms are caused by hard, compacted stools that build up in the rectum
and then overflow.

If you are affected in this way, your doctor might recommend medicines and treatments
that help the bowel to empty more completely when you use the toilet, so that hard
stools don’t collect there.

Problems with the spinal cord and nerves
If your symptoms are caused by damage to your spinal cord or to the nerves in your
intestines, your doctor should refer you to a system specialist (neurologist). They might suggest treatments that stimulate the nerves, or even surgery.

Problems with the sphincter muscle
If your symptoms are caused by problems with the muscle that keeps the anus closed
(called the sphincter muscle), there are various treatments that can help, including:



Pelvic floor exercises similar to the ones that pregnant women use to strengthen their pelvic muscles



Biofeedback, a technique that helps you to understand and control some of your body’s function,
and



Electrical stimulation of the muscles.



Your doctor may also suggest surgery to strengthen the sphincter. This operation can work well. But many people find that
their problems return after 4 or 5 years.

Severe incontinence where treatments haven’t helped
If your symptoms are severe and other treatments haven’t made much difference, your
doctor may suggest that you think about changing the way you pass stools completely.

This would involve having an artificial opening (called a stoma) made in your abdomen, which would empty your stools into a disposable bag called
a colostomy bag.

This treatment can help when nothing else has worked. But there can be complications,
including skin and muscle problems. This is a major operation, and you should discuss
it with your doctor in detail before you make a decision.

What to expect in the future
Many people’s symptoms improve with treatment. But this improvement can take time
and can depend on what caused the problems in the first place.

It also depends on whether you keep up with the treatments that help. Many people
find this difficult, especially as they get older.

Your doctor should check up on you every few months. If you have been referred to
a specialist, they should follow up with you as often as is needed, especially if
you have had treatments such as surgery or nerve stimulation."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/3000290/Factitious%20disorders,Factitious disorders,"Factitious disorders Last published: Sep 30, 2022
People with factitious disorders pretend to have medical problems that they don’t
have, in order to get medical attention, even if they don’t need it. It’s not clear
why people do this.

Some people fake symptoms or harm themselves to get medical attention, while others
fake symptoms in someone else - often their child - or harm them, to get attention.

If you think that you need help for a factitious disorder, or that someone close to
you needs help, you can use our information to talk to your doctor.

If you've got good reason to believe that someone you know is harming someone else
to get medical attention, tell the authorities immediately.

What are factitious disorders?
It’s unusual for a doctor to doubt what a patient tells them. When they do, it’s usually
because someone is confused about their symptoms and about how to describe them.

But, rarely, a doctor has a good reason to think that someone is not being honest
about their symptoms in order to get medical attention and treatment they don’t need.

When someone behaves in this way, doctors say that they have a factitious disorder
(the word factitious means fake). An extreme example of a factitious disorder that
you may have heard of is Munchausen syndrome.

Factitious disorders are rare and complex. It’s not clear why people are affected
by them. And it’s possible that people who have them aren’t always fully aware of
what they are doing or why.

A factitious disorder is not the same as faking a medical problem to gain something,
such as drugs or disability benefits. People with factitious disorders seem to want
medical attention for its own sake.

Factitious disorders can also be imposed on someone else. This is sometimes called a factitious disorder 'by proxy'. This means that someone
pretends that someone under their care needs medical attention.

Some people go as far as to harm that person, often a child, by giving them medicines
that produce symptoms of an illness, or by injuring them. This is a dangerous form
of abuse that can cause coma and even death.

If you think that someone you know is harming someone else to get medical attention,
tell the authorities right away.

We’re not sure what causes factitious disorders, but the reasons are unlikely to be
simple. For example, they could be signs of other complex problems or needs - a bit
like a 'cry for help'.

Some possible reasons for factitious disorders are when someone:


Feels a strong need to be the centre of attention


Feels a strong need to be cared for


Has a bad reaction to a loss in their life, such as a bereavement or the end of a
relationship. Grief can make people act in ways they normally wouldn’t, and which
they can’t always control



Feels anger, or directs anger, towards the medical profession


Gets pleasure from fooling others.


Factitious disorders are rare. But they seem more likely to affect:


Women - although Munchausen syndrome is more common in men


People with personality disorders


Unmarried people, and


People who work in health care or who have a parent who works in health care.


What are the symptoms?
Someone with a factitious disorder can seek needless medical treatment for themselves
or for someone else.

When someone seeks needless treatment for themselves, they may pretend to have symptoms of a physical or mental-health condition. Or they
may deliberately injure themselves, or do something to make themselves ill.

When someone seeks needless treatment for someone else - for example, their child - they may pretend that the other person is ill or injured.
Or they may injure that person or do something to make them ill.

Factitious disorders and symptoms of physical problems
Not everyone with a factitious disorder behaves in the same way. For one thing, different
people will go to different lengths to get attention. For example:



Some people may simply exaggerate genuine symptoms to make themselves more interesting
to their doctor. This is not helpful, and it wastes time and resources, but it is
not always dangerous



Some people fake evidence and test results - for example, by putting a drop of blood
into their urine sample. Blood in the urine can suggest a problem with the kidneys
or urinary tract that would need more medical treatment



People have been known to deliberately infect a wound using saliva, or even to inject
faeces into their bloodstream to cause fever or sepsis. This can be life threatening.



Other examples of what people do to get medical attention include:


People who don’t have diabetes taking insulin (a drug used to treat diabetes) that they don’t need to make themselves ill



Pretending to have Usher syndrome (a genetic disorder that causes deafness and blindness)



Taking laxatives to give themselves diarrhoea



Injecting egg into their bladder to make it seem as though they have too much protein in their
urine, and



Seeing several different doctors at different clinics to get as much attention as
possible.



Munchausen syndrome
The most well-known factitious disorder is Munchausen syndrome. People with this condition often tell their doctor about mysterious illnesses picked
up while travelling in exotic places.

They are often found to have sought medical help from many different hospitals, for
different complaints, and to have left those hospitals against medical advice when
it became clear that their symptoms were not genuine.

Some people with Munchausen syndrome have multiple scars from needless surgical procedures.

Factitious disorders and symptoms of mental-health problems
Factitious disorders are not always linked to physical conditions, and can involve
faking symptoms of mental-health problems.

Symptoms and conditions that people are known to fake include depression, suicidal thoughts, and amnesia. People with factitious disorders often exaggerate their symptoms more when they
are with a doctor, or when they are in a healthcare facility, such as a psychiatric
ward or hospital.

What treatments are available?
Unfortunately, factitious orders are hard to treat, and many people don’t get treatment.
Before someone can be helped, they need to admit their problem. But people with a
factitious disorder often refuse to admit that they are not telling the truth.

There are many possible reasons for this. For example: they may feel such a strong
urge to seek treatment that they can’t fully understand or accept the truth. So they
keep seeking treatment, possibly from a different doctor or hospital.

A cautious, respectful approach
Directly confronting someone, and accusing them of being dishonest, is unlikely to
help that person to accept their situation, and is likely to lead to an angry, negative
reaction.

So, if a doctor suspects that someone is seeking treatment because of a factitious
disorder, they should:



Be clear that, although they suspect the person is not being truthful, they will get
any treatment that is urgent: for example, even if a person is suspected of injuring
or harming themselves, those injuries will still be treated



Be clear that they are not judging the person


Not suggest that the person may be punished for their actions


Respect the person’s dignity, and


Reassure the person that help is available.


The doctor should also:


Pause any planned major treatments, such as medical procedures or surgery, and


Consider stopping any medicines that the person has been prescribed for the symptoms
they have reported, if they think that those medicines may harm the person.



When people accept treatment, various types of psychotherapy ('talking treatments')
can be used to try and understand and change the person’s behaviour.

But it’s hard to know how well these treatments work because, sadly, so few people
accept help. Many people simply go elsewhere to try to get treatment, and the problem
continues.

If a doctor suspects that someone has injured or harmed someone else to get medical
attention, it is likely that they will need to inform the police. If a doctor suspects
someone of abusing a child, they should always inform the police.

What to expect in the future
If someone is able to admit to their condition and accept help, then there are treatments
that may help.

But if someone doesn’t get help they could be at risk of serious harm. The more needless
treatments, procedures, and operations someone has, the more likely they are to suffer
harm and complications, infections, and even death.

People can also harm themselves by taking medicines that produce symptoms, and by
taking medicines they don’t need for conditions they don’t have.

There is also a chance that, once a person has a reputation for not being trustworthy,
medical staff will doubt them when they have real symptoms.

If you've got concerns about someone you know who may be affected by a factitious
disorder, you can ask your doctor about trying to get help."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1552619506876/Essential%20tremor,Essential tremor,"Essential tremor Last published: Dec 07, 2021
If you have essential tremor, your hands tremble or your head shakes. This can make
it hard for you to do everyday things, like drink a cup of tea without spilling it.
There are medicines that can help.

What is essential tremor?
If you have essential tremor, your hands or head start shaking, usually when you’re
trying to do something.

The name essential tremor means that you have a tremor but doctors can't find a reason
for it. Doctors aren't sure why some people get essential tremor, but it seems to
run in families.

What are the symptoms?
You're most likely to notice shaking in your hands. About 7 in 10 people with essential
tremor get it in their hands. The tremor may start in only one hand. But usually,
with time, both hands are affected.

You won't notice the tremor when you are resting or sleeping. It happens when you're
holding a position, like stretching your arms out, or when you're trying to do something
with your hands, like write.

About half of people with essential tremor also have a head tremor. Their head shakes
up and down, or from side to side. Some people also find their voice shakes. The tremor
may be worse when you are tired or stressed.

Your doctor will check to see if your tremor is caused by an illness or a medicine
you are taking. He or she will ask about your medicines, your family history, and
any other symptoms.

Your doctor will examine you, and you'll have blood tests, including a test to make
sure your thyroid gland (a gland in your neck) is working properly.

You may need other tests, including scans to see images of the inside of your body
(such as CT scans and MRI scans), to check for other illnesses that cause a tremor,
such as a stroke. You will only be diagnosed with essential tremor if your doctor
has ruled out other causes for your tremor.

What treatments work?
If your tremor interferes with your life, there are treatments that may help. They
can’t cure the tremor, but they can make it less noticeable. If your tremor doesn’t
bother you, you may decide not to have treatment at all.

Things you can do for yourself
Lifestyle changes help some people with essential tremor. You could try:


yoga or relaxation exercises


avoiding caffeine (coffee, tea, and chocolate), and


avoiding getting stressed or tired.


Medicines
Several medicines are used to help control the shaking caused by essential tremor.
Two of them are propranolol and primidone.

Both of these medicines can cause side effects in some people. Your doctor should
discuss these with you before you start taking these medicines. For example:



propranolol can cause dizziness, sleep problems, and nausea. Rarely, it can cause
more serious side effects, such as shortness of breath. If this happens, tell your
doctor immediately.



primidone can cause nausea, vomiting, and sudden jerky movements when you first start
taking it. These side effects usually pass after a while.



If you can’t take these medicines, or if they don't help, your doctor might suggest
medicines that are usually used for treating epilepsy. They are called anticonvulsants.

If your symptoms are severe, and other medicines haven't worked well enough, your
doctor may suggest medicines that have a more sedative effect. But this is not common.

Other treatments
If you have very bad essential tremor and have tried several different medicines without
finding one that helps, your doctor may advise surgery on the brain. This is very
rare.

What will happen to me?
Many people aren't bothered by the tremor and don't even go to see their doctor. It
usually starts as a mild problem, although it may slowly get worse. If your tremor
bothers you, there are treatments that can help.

Where to get more help
You might be able to find support groups or charities either locally or online. For
example, in the UK, the National Tremor Foundation (tremor.org.uk) offers support
and help to people with essential tremor."

If you have erection problems you may want to talk to your doctor to find out more.
And it's likely that your doctor will want to ask you some questions, too.
Here are some questions you might want to ask


Do you think my erection problems have a physical cause?


Are there any changes in my lifestyle that would help my erection problems?

Am I taking any medicines that would make it dangerous for me to take Viagra (or a
similar drug)?



Do I have any health problems that would make it dangerous for me to take drugs like
Viagra?



Are drugs like Viagra the best treatment for my problems or should I try something
else?



Is it likely that stress has caused my erection problems?


Would it help to talk to a medical professional about how I feel about my erection
problems?



Should I see someone with my partner?


Here are some questions your doctor may ask you


When was the last time you had an erection that was firm enough for sex?


When did the problem start?


Did it happen gradually or suddenly?


How often do you have problems getting an erection? Do you have erections at all?

If you have problems getting an erection you're not alone. Millions of men have erection
problems. Doctors see men with this problem all the time. And, once you see your doctor,
there are good treatments that can help.

What are erection problems?
Most men have trouble getting an erection at some point in their life. It can happen
for all sorts of reasons. But when doctors talk about erection problems, they mean
that you can't usually keep an erection long enough to have sex.

Many men sometimes have problems getting or keeping an erection. In young men this
is usually because of nervousness or worrying about whether they will be 'good in
bed' (so-called 'performance anxiety').

Drinking too much alcohol can also make it difficult to get an erection. And most
men don't get erections as easily as they get older. This doesn't usually mean that
they can't get an erection: usually it just happens more slowly.

If you repeatedly can't get an erection it's worth thinking about whether the problem
might be psychological (caused by nervousness or anxiety) rather than physical, before
getting treatment. Talking to your doctor can help you figure out why it might be
happening.

Physical problems
The most common physical cause of long-term erection problems is poor blood flow to
the penis. This is caused by problems with the blood vessels in the area.

Diabetes can lead to erection problems. Other illnesses, physical injuries, or problems
with your hormones can all cause erection problems, too.

Conditions that affect the body's nervous system can sometimes cause erection problems.
These conditions include Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, stroke, and multiple
sclerosis.

Some medicines can cause erection problems as a side effect. Other things that can
play a part in erection problems are long-term excess alcohol intake and smoking.

Your emotions can also be a factor. Stress, unhappiness, and depression can all cause
erection problems.

If you've had surgery in your pelvic area, such as an operation on your prostate,
this can also lead to erection problems.

What are the symptoms?
Some men with erection problems can't get an erection at all. For others, the problem
comes and goes. Some men can get an erection but it doesn't last long enough or isn’t
firm enough to have satisfying sex.

Men who have erection problems often don't like to ask for help. But there are at
least two good reasons for seeing a doctor. First, there are treatments that can probably
help you. Second, erection problems can be an early warning of serious health problems,
such as diabetes and heart disease.

If you are having erection problems your doctor might suggest tests to check for other
health problems, just to be safe.

What treatments work?
Most men can find a treatment that helps them have erections again.
If your erection problems are caused by another health problem, the first thing your
doctor will suggest is doing everything possible to get that condition under control.

For example, if your problems are caused by poor blood flow to the penis, your doctor
might suggest some changes to your lifestyle to improve your circulation. These could
be changes to your diet, or a plan to help you lose weight and do more exercise.

Drug treatments
You've probably heard of Viagra. It's the brand name of a drug called sildenafil.
It's a type of drug called a PDE5 inhibitor. These drugs help open up the blood vessels
around the penis so that blood can flow more easily into the penis. About a quarter
of men with erection problems take them.

Most men who use these medications take them as tablets. But they can also be taken
as injections or suppositories. If you take them as tablets you need to take them
between half an hour and an hour before you want to have sex.

These drugs don't work for everyone but they seem to help about 7 or 8 out of 10 men
to have firmer, longer-lasting erections. These drugs seem to work for men with a
variety of causes of erection problems. For example, they can help if you have heart
problems, prostate cancer, diabetes, or an injury to your spinal cord.

Some men get side effects from these drugs but they're usually mild. You might get
a headache, get heartburn, or turn red in the face. The side effects aren't usually
bad enough for men to stop taking their treatment.

Not everyone can take these drugs safely. Your doctor should explain in detail who
should not take them. Some of the reasons you shouldn't take them include:



if you are taking medications called nitrates


if you have severe heart disease or you have had a heart attack in the last three
months



if you have other heart conditions including unstable angina


if you have either very high or very low blood pressure


if you have had a stroke in the last three months


if you have a history of a condition called priapism. This is where you get painful
erections that last for several hours, even when you are not aroused.



In most countries you need a prescription for PDE5 inhibitors such as sildenafil (Viagra).
For example, in the UK, even though it's legal for a pharmacy to sell these drugs
on the internet, you will still need a prescription.

But many companies sell treatments for erection problems on the internet and it isn’t
always easy to tell which ones are reliable or safe. If you're in any doubt about
what is being offered, talk to your doctor.

Injections
If you are not able to take the usual drug treatments for erection problems, you might
be able to have a treatment that involves you (or your partner) injecting medicine
into the base of your penis. If you have this treatment your doctor will explain exactly
how to give yourself the injection.

This treatment is not suitable for everyone and your doctor should explain in detail
who can and cannot use it.

This treatment can have side effects. Some men get pain or an ache in their penis.
Giving yourself an injection can be painful. A few men get a lump of thickened tissue
in their penis.

Talking treatments (psychosexual therapy)
Sometimes erection problems are caused by thoughts or emotions rather than by a physical
problem. Stress, anxiety, and worry can all lead to erection problems.

Similarly, having erection problems can in turn lead to stress and anxiety - which
can then make your sexual problems worse. Or it might be that you become anxious or
depressed if other treatments aren't working.

If you are affected in any of these ways your doctor might suggest a talking treatment
(psychotherapy), either as a treatment on its own or alongside other treatments. You
can see a therapist on your own or with your partner.

If you have psychosexual therapy (sometimes called sex therapy), a counsellor listens
to your problems and makes suggestions. For example, they might help you find ways
of being relaxed with your partner or help you to understand the feelings you get
from your body during sex.

Other treatments
If you can't take PDE5 inhibitors or have injections, or if you have tried them and
they haven't worked, you might be able to use intraurethral suppositories. These are small pellets that you insert into the end of your penis using an automatic
dispenser. Some men use these because they don't like the idea of injections.

Some men with erection problems use vacuum pumps to help them get an erection. These are devices that have a plastic tube connected
to a pump. The tube fits over your penis, then the pump sucks blood into your penis
and gives you an erection.

You put a special elastic band around the base of your penis to keep it firm while
you have sex. You shouldn't keep this band on for more than about half an hour. Doctors
usually only recommend using pumps if other treatments haven't worked. These devices
can cause side effects, such as bruising.

Drug treatments for erection problems now include a cream medication that you rub into the penis to help open up the blood vessels. But this treatment
is not available everywhere.

If all other treatments have failed, or if you have had certain types of injury in
your groin area, your doctor might suggest surgery. You will be referred to a specialist called a urologist. Although surgery can help,
your urologist will carefully discuss with you the risks and possible complications
of this type of operation. These include infection and the possible need for a second
operation.

What will happen to me?
You might have thought of erection problems as something you just had to put up with,
or even a normal part of getting older. But there are treatments that work for most
men.

It's also worth remembering that there are lots of ways to give and receive sexual
pleasure. If you have a partner it's often helpful for them to understand your difficulties
and for you to approach these together."

Epilepsy is a serious condition that causes people to have seizures (fits). But there
are medicines that work well to keep it under control. With treatment, most people
get fewer seizures or none at all.

What treatments work?
If you or your child has epilepsy the normal electrical activity in the brain gets
disturbed from time to time. This leads to seizures.

A seizure affects how your brain works. What happens to you during a seizure depends
on the part of the brain that is affected. During a seizure you may feel strange and
your body might move in odd ways. Your muscles may go limp or stiff, and you may shake,
twitch, or black out. But seizures tend to be over quickly.

The usual treatment for epilepsy is taking medicines. Doctors usually wait for someone
to have at least two seizures before they start treatment. Epilepsy medicines reduce
or stop seizures for most people. Most epilepsy medicines have side effects. You’ll
need to work with your doctor to find the medicine (or combination of medicines) that
works best for you.

Medicines
The medicines used to prevent epileptic seizures are called anti-epileptic or anti-convulsant
medicines. There are several available. Different ones work better for different people.
You may need to try different ones to see which works best for you.

Most people with epilepsy can control their seizures with just one epilepsy medicine.
The seizures may stop, be less severe, or happen less often.

About half of all people who take epilepsy medicines get some side effects. Common
side effects include dizziness, nausea, skin rashes, exhaustion, and weight gain or
weight loss.

Some of the drugs can cause different side effects, such as depression and temporary
hair loss.

But, if you get side effects, your doctor may cut down the dose and wait two weeks
before increasing it again. You may then find that the side effects stop. Or you might
be able to switch to another medicine.

You should see your doctor immediately if you or your child gets a rash while taking
any epilepsy medicines. Although the rash will probably go away, very rarely it can
develop into a serious (and sometimes fatal) skin condition called Stevens-Johnson
syndrome.

Epilepsy, pregnancy, and contraception
Women with epilepsy usually need to carry on taking epilepsy medicines during pregnancy.
But some medicines can cause birth defects. It’s very important to talk to your doctor
if you are planning to get pregnant. You may need to switch to another medicine.

If you don’t want to get pregnant, talk to your doctor about the best type of contraception
to use. Some epilepsy medicines can stop the contraceptive pill and contraceptive
injections working properly.

Things you can do for yourself
You may find it helpful to learn about epilepsy, so you know what to expect and how
to live with it. Ask your doctor if there is an education programme you can attend.

People who go on an education programme sometimes have fewer seizures afterwards.
That might be because the education programme helps them take their treatment the
right way or to avoid things that can trigger a seizure. Children who go on these
programmes often say they feel more positive and confident about life and that this
helps them to do better at school.

For more background information on epilepsy see our leaflet Epilepsy: what is it?
What will happen to me?
Most people with epilepsy lead a full, healthy, and active life. There is very little
that epilepsy stops them doing.

If you've had only one seizure, you may not have another. Nearly two-thirds of people
don't have another seizure in the two years after their first. But if you've had two
or more seizures you are very likely to have more. It's unlikely that the seizures
will go away without treatment.

You or your child may be able to stop taking medicines if the seizures stop. But if
the seizures don't stop you may need to take medicines for the rest of your life.
If you have been free of seizures for two years you could talk to your doctor about
stopping your medicines. But your chance of having another seizure goes up again when
you stop taking your medicines.

You should not stop taking epilepsy medicines without a doctor’s help. Most people
need to reduce the dose very gradually. Stopping taking these medicines suddenly can
cause seizures.

Most seizures are not harmful. But they can increase your chances of having an injury.
Very rarely, people with epilepsy can have a bad seizure that lasts a long time. Doctors
call this status epilepticus. It can be dangerous.

Pregnancy
Having a baby when you have epilepsy is not as safe as for most women. But more than
90 in 100 women with epilepsy who get pregnant have a normal, healthy baby. If you're
planning to get pregnant you should discuss your epilepsy treatment with your doctor
first.

Epilepsy and driving, work, and leisure time
If you've had a seizure you must stop driving, even if you haven't been diagnosed
with epilepsy. You will need to write to the relevant vehicle registration agency
(for example, in the UK it's the DVLA) to let them know you've had a seizure. They
might decide that you need to stop driving altogether. Or you may be allowed to start
driving again if you don't have a seizure for a certain period of time.

You might also have to think about changes to the way you work: for example, if you
work with machinery, or at height (for example, up ladders), or in a commercial kitchen.
You might have to take similar precautions with your hobbies and leisure activities.

Surgery
Most people with epilepsy don't need surgery. But if medicines don’t work to control
your epilepsy, you may be suitable for surgical treatments. This is a big step and
you will need tests to be certain surgery is likely to help you. Your doctor will
explain the types of surgery that might help."

on the part of the brain that is affected. During a seizure you may feel strange and

twitch, or black out. But seizures tend to be over quickly.

Seizures can affect nerve cells in one particular part of your brain. These are called
partial seizures (sometimes called focal seizures). Or they can affect nerve cells all over your brain. These are called generalised seizures.

Your doctor may not be able to tell you why you or your child has epilepsy. About
70 in 100 people with epilepsy never find out the cause. But some people's epilepsy
is known to have a cause, such as an illness, an infection, an injury, or a problem
in the way their brain developed.

For more information on treatments for epilepsy see our leaflet Epilepsy: what treatments work?
What are the symptoms?
The only symptom most people get from epilepsy is having seizures. Seizures can last
for a few seconds or for several minutes. After a seizure is over, some people know
what happened to them but others don’t remember.

Seizures are not usually harmful. But if you see someone having a seizure that lasts
more than five minutes, call for an ambulance. The person having the seizure may need
emergency treatment to stop it.

After a person's first seizure their doctor should send them to a specialist for tests.
The specialist will do a type of scan called an electroencephalogram (EEG) and other
tests to try to find out if the person has epilepsy.

There are many types of seizure. Most people will get only one type. It's important
for your doctor to work out what type of seizure you or your child has had. Some treatments
work best for certain types of seizure. Different types of seizure affect your brain
differently.

Focal seizures
Focal seizures affect just one part of your brain. The symptoms depend on what that
part of the brain does.



In some focal seizures, you remain aware of what's going on. The muscles in your arms,
legs, and face may become stiff and your limbs may twitch on one side of your body.
You may have unusual sensations, such as smelling strange smells, having distorted
vision, or feeling scared.



Sometimes there is a warning sign (an aura) before a focal seizure. When this happens
you become less aware of your surroundings. You might black out (lose consciousness).
Some people start fidgeting or walking around.



Generalised seizures
Generalised seizures affect your whole brain. During most of these seizures the person
blacks out (loses consciousness). These are the main types:



Tonic-clonic seizures cause a mixture of symptoms. These symptoms include stiffening
of your body and jerking of your arms and legs. Some people bite their tongue or lose
control of their bladder during the seizure.



Absence seizures cause you to appear like you're staring blankly into space and are
unaware of your surroundings. They usually last only a few seconds. These happen most
commonly in children and teenagers. They don't usually continue into adulthood.



Myoclonic seizures cause your upper body, arms, or legs to jerk or twitch. You tend
not to black out if you have this type of seizure.



Atonic seizures make your muscles suddenly relax. This makes you fall down without
warning.



What will happen to me?
Most people with epilepsy lead a full, healthy, and active life. There is very little
that epilepsy stops them doing.

If you've had only one seizure, you may not have another. Nearly two-thirds of people
don't have another seizure in the two years after their first. But if you've had two
or more seizures you are very likely to have more. It's unlikely that the seizures

Where to get more help
Ask your doctor about support groups and charities in your area that may be able to
help. For example, in the UK the Epilepsy Society (http://www.epilepsysociety.org.uk/)
is a charity offering advice and support to people with epilepsy and their families."

As men get older their prostate can get bigger. This can cause problems, such as having
to get up at night to urinate. But an enlarged prostate isn't usually a serious health
problem. So after talking with your doctor you might choose to wait before deciding
to have any treatment.

You can use our information to talk to your doctor and decide which treatments are
right for you.

What treatments work?
When men have an enlarged prostate doctors sometimes call it 'benign prostatic hyperplasia',
or BPH for short. You might also hear it called 'lower urinary tract symptoms', or
LUTS for short.

There are several treatments for BPH, including medicines and surgery. The treatments
your doctor suggests will usually depend on how much your symptoms bother you.

If your symptoms don't bother you too much, your doctor may suggest that you try 'watchful
waiting'. This means that you and your doctor keep a close eye on your symptoms, but
you don’t have any treatment for the time being.

You can decide to have treatment for BPH at any time.
Medicines
There are several types of medicines for treating BPH. If one type doesn’t help you,
you may be treated with more than one.



Alpha-blockers work by relaxing the muscles in your prostate and bladder. This makes it easier for
you to urinate. Your symptoms should start to get better after about two to three
weeks.

But alpha-blockers can cause side effects, including tiredness, headaches, and feeling
light-headed when you stand up. This light-headedness can cause some people to fall
and injure themselves.

Alpha-blockers can also cause dry climax during sex (you don't ejaculate when you
have an orgasm), although this may be temporary.



5-alpha reductase inhibitors work by blocking hormones that help the prostate grow. But they take a few months
to work. They may help reduce the size of your prostate by about one third. This should
make it easier to pass urine.

They can also reduce your chances of suddenly being unable to pass urine, a condition
that needs to be treated urgently, usually with surgery. But these drugs probably
won't help if you only have mild symptoms to begin with.

Side effects of these drugs can include problems getting an erection, premature ejaculation,
and dry climax. Men who are planning to father a child shouldn't take these drugs,
as they can cause birth defects.

Women who are breastfeeding or pregnant shouldn't handle the tablets. Sexually active
men should use condoms if there is a chance their partner could become pregnant.



Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors. You may have heard of these drugs, especially one called sildenafil (Viagra) being
used for treating erection problems.

But they can also help with BPH symptoms. Doctors might suggest these medicines for
people whose symptoms include erection problems.

Common side effects include headaches, upset stomach, or flushing (redness) in the
face. More serious side effects include blurred vision or sudden loss of vision, sudden
loss of hearing, chest pain, and shortness of breath. Seek medical attention straight
away if you have any of these symptoms.



Anticholinergics can help relax the bladder muscle and reduce the feeling of needing to urinate frequently.

Side effects of these drugs can include dizziness and a dry mouth.


Things you can do for yourself
Your doctor might suggest some changes to your lifestyle to help relieve your symptoms.




Avoid drinking large amounts of liquid at any one time.


Avoid drinks altogether before going to bed.


Get plenty of exercise.


Reduce the amount of alcohol you drink (alcohol can stimulate your bladder).


Cut back on coffee, tea, cola, or any other drinks that contain caffeine (caffeine
can stimulate your bladder).



Check any medicines you are taking. Some antihistamines (drugs used to treat allergies)
and some drugs used to treat depression can make your problems with urinating worse.



You may have seen herbal treatments for an enlarged prostate. You can buy these without
a prescription. They include things like rye grass pollen, Pygeum africanum, and saw palmetto.

But there isn't much good evidence that any of them help much, if at all, with prostate
symptoms. And, like medicines, they can have side effects.

You should always talk to your doctor before trying a herbal extract for an enlarged
prostate. Herbal products are not regulated in the same way as medicines.

Surgery
The most common operation used to cut away part of the prostate is called transurethral resection of the prostate, or TURP. It removes the blockage caused by your enlarged prostate so that you can urinate
more quickly and easily.

You may have heavy bleeding into your urine immediately after surgery. But this should
pass after a few days.

Some men get TURP syndrome for a few days after this operation. This can make you
feel slightly confused or queasy, and you might vomit. TURP syndrome can also raise
your blood pressure or cause temporary problems with your sight.

TURP can also cause some other side effects:


About 70 in 100 men get dry climax during sex


Doctors used to think that TURP caused erection problems, but more recent research
has suggested that this isn't the case. If there is a risk of erection problems with
TURP it is probably a small one



Some men need another operation in the future because their prostate gets bigger again.


Other types of surgery
There are several other surgical procedures used to treat symptoms of BPH. Some of
them are less invasive than TURP, which means that your stay in hospital will probably
be shorter and there is less chance of complications.

Some of these treatments are fairly new compared with TURP. Some people might choose
them because they are less invasive. But we're still not sure about how well they
relieve symptoms in the longer term compared with TURP.

It's also worth remembering that these treatments are not available everywhere. Your
choice of available treatments is likely to vary between hospitals.

Transurethral microwave thermotherapy (TUMT) uses microwaves to destroy prostate tissue without damaging other tissues. A tube
called a catheter is passed up through the opening of the penis (urethra). Then a
small antenna at the end of the catheter emits microwaves that attack the prostate.

This procedure can be done as an outpatient treatment and usually takes between one
and two hours.

Several treatments use lasers to remove some of the prostate tissue that is causing
problems. They include transurethral holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP), photoselective vaporisation (PVP), and thulium laser enucleation (ThuLEP). These can all usually done under local anaesthetic without an overnight stay in
hospital.

Transurethral vaporisation of the prostate (TUVP) also involves passing an instrument through the urethra. This instrument is moved
over the surface of your prostate. It uses an electric current to heat the tissue
and burn it away. This current also seals the blood vessels and stops bleeding.

Transurethral needle ablation (TUNA) involves a pair of needles being inserted into the urethra. Radio waves are passed
through the needles, which heats them up. This shrinks the prostate tissue that is
getting in the way.

How do I decide which treatment is right for me?
You may want to ask yourself some questions:


How bad are my symptoms? If they are affecting your life then you may want to consider
treatment. But men with mild symptoms often don’t get any worse for many years and
prefer to wait to see what happens.



Do I want to take tablets every day? You may need to take these for a while before
you get any results, and after a few years you may need surgery anyway.



Do I want a permanent and quick solution? If you’re not happy to wait a few months
to see if a drug treatment helps, then you may be better off opting for surgery. Also,
remember that some men who take drug treatment end up needing surgery. But surgery
also has side effects."

Only men have a prostate gland. The prostate can get larger as men get older. This
can cause problems, such as having to get up at night to urinate.

But an enlarged prostate isn't usually a serious health problem. After discussing
your options with your doctor you might choose to wait before deciding to have any
treatment.

What is the prostate?
The prostate is a small, solid gland about the size of a walnut. It is at the base
of your bladder.

The front of your prostate is wrapped around your urethra, the tube that carries urine and semen out of your body. The back of your prostate
rests against your back passage (rectum). Your doctor can feel the prostate through
the wall of your rectum.

A change in the size or shape of your prostate can narrow the urethra, making it difficult
for you to urinate.

Many men's prostate glands get larger as they get older. When this happens doctors
call it benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH. You may also hear it called LUTS, which is short for lower urinary tract symptoms.

BPH is not cancer and it isn't usually a serious health problem. But the symptoms of BPH can be difficult
to live with.

Many men find it difficult to talk to their doctors about prostate problems. But there's
no need to be embarrassed. Your doctor will have seen many men with your symptoms.

What are the symptoms of an enlarged prostate?
You might notice some of the symptoms of BPH or LUTS as you get older. It's important
to get these symptoms checked by a doctor, because some BPH symptoms are similar to
those of more serious conditions such as prostate cancer.

Your doctor might also be able to give you some simple advice that can help your symptoms
without any treatment. Symptoms of an enlarged prostate include:



having to wait before you can start urinating


stopping and starting when urinating


having to push or strain to urinate


having a weak stream of urine


feeling like your bladder's never quite empty


having to urinate more often than you used to


finding it difficult to put off urinating


needing to get up at night to urinate


dribbling after you pass urine


often feeling desperate to urinate (this is called urgency).


Having an enlarged prostate can also affect you in other ways. For example, you might:


feel tired because you never sleep through the night


feel anxious during the day if you're not close to a toilet, or


find that it distrupts your daily life. For example, you might stop playing sports
or going out with friends.



Do I need treatment?
This is a difficult question to answer. Only you can decide whether your symptoms
are bothering you so much that you’d like some treatment.

But your doctor might suggest that you have treatment if he or she thinks that there
is a danger that your symptoms could lead to worse problems.

If you don’t find your symptoms too troublesome your doctor may suggest that you try
watchful waiting. This means that you see your doctor regularly to monitor your symptoms, but you
don’t have any other treatment for the time being.

Your doctor might suggest some things that may help with your symptoms. There isn't
much research about the following tips, but they might help.



Avoid drinking large amounts of liquid at any one time.


Avoid drinks altogether before going to bed.


Reduce the amount of alcohol you drink (alcohol can stimulate your bladder).


Cut back on coffee, tea, cola, or any other drinks that contain caffeine (caffeine
can stimulate your bladder).



Discuss with your doctor any medicines you are taking. Some antihistamines (drugs
used to treat allergies) and some drugs used to treat depression can make your problems
with urinating worse.



When you go for check-ups your doctor will ask whether your symptoms have got any
worse and if you think you would like any treatment.

He or she might discuss the benefits and risks of different treatments with you. To
learn more, see our leaflet: Enlarged prostate: what treatments are there?

What will happen to me if I choose not to have treatment?
No one can tell you for certain whether your symptoms will get worse over time. But
BPH doesn't usually get worse quickly, so you don't have to rush into having treatment.


Many men find that their symptoms gradually get worse as they get older. But this
is not always the case.



Some men find that their symptoms change slowly.


Others find that they don't change at all.


Some men even find that their symptoms get better on their own.


Although it's usually harmless, BPH can sometimes cause serious complications.
For example, it can make you unable to urinate at all. This is called acute urinary retention. It needs to be treated urgently, usually with surgery. Serious problems like this
happen to about 10 in 100 men with BPH.

Getting treatment with BPH can reduce your chance of getting serious problems. Still,
doctors often advise men to wait and see what happens before they start treatment.
This is because symptoms don’t usually change very quickly.

If your symptoms do change quickly, though, you should see your doctor right away."

This information tells you about upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, a test to look
inside your stomach. It explains how the test is done, the risks involved, and what
to expect afterwards.

You might also hear doctors call this test a gastroscopy, upper endoscopy, or just
endoscopy. You can use our information to discuss your procedure with the doctors
and nurses treating you.

What is an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy?
An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is a test to look inside your:

oesophagus (the tube that carries food from your mouth to your stomach)



stomach, and



duodenum (the top part of your bowel or intestine).


This is done using a thin, flexible tube called a gastroscope or endoscope. On the end of the tube are a camera and a light. You swallow the tube, which then
passes down your throat and into your stomach.

An endoscopy can check for problems such as:

cancer in the stomach



ulcers in the lining of your stomach or duodenum, and



damage from acid reflux (when acid in the stomach goes back up the oesophagus).


Why might I need an endoscopy?
Your doctor might suggest that you have an endoscopy if you have symptoms of any of
the problems listed above.

You should also have an urgent endoscopy if you:

are vomiting blood or


have a lot of blood in your stools.

You doctor will probably also suggest an endoscopy if you have indigestion along with
any of the following:


losing weight without trying


vomiting a lot for no clear reason


anaemia (not enough iron in your blood)


having trouble swallowing


a lump in your upper abdomen.

These things can be possible signs of stomach cancer. But most people who have an
endoscopy find that they don’t have cancer.

If you're finding it hard to swallow properly, your oesophagus might have become scarred
and narrow because your stomach is making too much acid. This condition is called
Barrett's oesophagus.

Your doctor might also suggest that you have an endoscopy if you are over 55 and have
started to have severe indigestion for no clear reason.

What will happen?
This type of endoscopy takes just about 5 to 10 minutes. But you'll probably need
to stay in hospital for at least an hour afterwards to give you time to recover.

Preparing for the endoscopy
You might need to stop taking some of your usual indigestion medicines for 2 weeks
before the test. That's because some medicines can hide problems that can be picked
up by the test. Your doctor should tell you if you need to stop your usual medicines.

You'll be asked not to eat anything for at least 4 hours before your endoscopy. This
is because food can stop the doctor seeing inside your stomach. You'll be able to
have a few sips of water up to 2 hours before your test.

You’ll probably be given a sedative medication to help you to relax. You’ll be awake during the test, but you might not
remember much about it afterwards.

During the test
The endoscopy happens like this:

You'll be asked to swallow the first part of a tube (the endoscope). It is slightly thicker than a pencil, but it's flexible, which makes it easier
to swallow.



You might be given a local anaesthetic before you swallow the tube. This makes your throat numb so it doesn't hurt when
you swallow the tube. The anaesthetic is sprayed into your throat, or given to you
as a lozenge to suck.



Swallowing the endoscope might make you retch, as if you want to vomit. You shouldn’t
be embarrassed if this happens. It’s very common and your doctor will be used to it.



When you've swallowed the endoscope, your doctor will push it gently down your throat,
through to your stomach and into the top part of your intestines (your duodenum).
You'll need to breathe through your nose during the test.



The endoscope has a light and a camera on its end. The camera sends pictures to a
screen.



Your doctor will watch the screen as they look around your oesophagus, stomach, and
duodenum.



The doctor will look for things like redness from too much acid, holes in the lining
of your stomach or duodenum (this could be an ulcer), or lumps and blockages that
could possibly be cancer.



During the endoscopy, your doctor might also take small samples of your tissue to
look at later. This is called a biopsy. You won't usually feel anything while the tissue is being removed. But if you're
in any pain, signal to your nurse or doctor.



When the test is over your doctor will remove the endoscope. This is usually easy
and shouldn’t hurt.


Wireless capsule endoscopy
A newer type of endoscopy involves swallowing a capsule, like a large pill, that has a tiny camera inside it. The camera sends pictures back
to your doctor’s computer.

You then pass the camera out in your stools when you go to the toilet.
This test is not yet widely available. And it tends to be used to look for problems
in the bowels (intestine) rather than in the oesophagus or stomach.

This test has many advantages over the traditional endoscopy method, and it is likely
to become more widely used.

What are the risks of an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy?
An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is usually simple and safe. The only problem that
most people might have is a sore throat for a few days.

But other problems do sometimes happen. These can include:

breathing problems, a fast heartbeat, or chest pain (angina) after the test. These problems are very rare. Most people recover quickly, although
some people need extra treatment and oxygen to help them breathe



pneumonia. If your breathing is shallow or you can't swallow properly, you might breathe tiny
pieces of food into your lungs after the test. The food gets lodged in your lungs
and can cause an infection. This is called aspiration pneumonia.If you get pneumonia, you might be given oxygen to help you breathe. You might be
told not to eat for an hour after your endoscopy to reduce your chance of breathing
in food



bleeding. Bleeding can happen during an endoscopy, especially if you have a biopsy. But this
should be easy to stop. If you are taking blood-thinning medicines, you might need
to stop taking them a few days before the procedure



an allergic reaction. Some people are allergic to the sedative medication. It's important to tell your
doctor before they procedure if you have any allergies



damage to the bowel. The endoscope can sometimes tear a hole in your oesophagus or stomach. Doctors call
this a perforation. It’s very rare, but if it happens you will need surgery to repair the damage.


What can I expect afterwards?
You shouldn’t be in any pain after this procedure. But if you had a sedative you might
feel drowsy for an hour or so afterwards.

Sedatives can slow down your reactions, so you won't be able to drive, and you'll
need someone to help you get home.

If you didn’t have a sedative, you might only need 15 minutes to 30 minutes to recover.
You can then go home or back to work.

If you had a local anaesthetic you won’t be able to eat or drink anything until it
wears off. This takes about an hour.

Your doctor might be able to give you the results of the endoscopy before you go home:
for example, they will be able to tell you if they clearly saw an ulcer. But if they
take samples of your tissue, you'll have to wait a little longer for the results.

The hospital might then send your results to your usual doctor, or you might need
to go to an outpatient clinic."

Endometriosis happens when tissues that make up the lining of your womb spread and
grow outside your womb. It can cause pain and it can make it harder to get pregnant.
But there are treatments that can help.

What treatments are available?
The lining of your womb is called the endometrium. Each month, the lining grows thicker as part of your monthly cycle, when your body
makes more of the hormone oestrogen.

Sometimes tissue from the endometrium starts growing in other parts of the inside
of your body. This is called endometriosis. No one knows for certain why it happens.

Endometriosis most often grows around your ovaries, fallopian tubes, the outside of
your womb or the lining of your pelvis. It can also grow around your rectum and bladder.


Women with endometriosis are more likely than other women to have problems getting
pregnant.

Treatments for endometriosis are different depending on whether or not you want to
get pregnant. For more on fertility treatments for women with endometriosis, see our
leaflet: Fertility treatments: what treatments work?
Medicines
If your main symptom is painful periods, you could try simple painkillers first, such
as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; one example is ibuprofen) or paracetamol.

If you don't want to get pregnant, your doctor may suggest you try the contraceptive pill. Some women find they work for all kinds of endometriosis pain, including painful
periods, continuous pain, and pain during sex.

Contraceptive pills can have side effects, but they are usually mild. They can include:


Headaches


Weight gain


Feeling bloated


Mood changes, and


Tender breasts.


Women taking contraceptive pills are also slightly more likely to get a blood clot
in the veins in their legs. If you are concerned about side effects, talk to your
doctor.

If you still get pain despite taking contraceptive pills, your doctor may suggest
you try a different type of hormone treatment. There are several different types. They
can all cause side effects in some people. But you might be able to find one that doesn't
cause you problems.

Talk to your doctor about which type might suit you best. It's important to remember
that you can't usually get pregnant while taking these types of hormonal medicines.

Surgery
Surgery to remove endometriosis may help with the pain. The type of surgery you are
offered will depend partly on whether you want to get pregnant in the future.

For example, the main reason that some women with endometriosis have surgery is to
help them get pregnant.

But if pregnancy is not an issue for you - for example, if you have already had a
family - your doctor might suggest a hysterectomy, which is an operation to remove the womb completely.

For most women, including those who still want to become pregnant, the operation removes
only the patches of endometriosis. This is often done using keyhole surgery. This
is quicker than open surgery.

The surgeon may use laser treatment or heat treatment to get rid of patches of endometriosis.
The surgeon also cleans up any scars and, where possible separates organs that are
stuck together.

Any operation has risks. Some side effects are more serious, but much less common.
These include damage to your bowel or your bladder, bleeding inside your body, infections,
or adhesions (tissue that sticks to organs and stops them working properly).

Some women have hormone treatments after surgery to remove endometriosis. This may
make the benefits of the operation last longer. But even so, many women find that
their pain returns a few years after they have surgery. If this happens to you, you
may be able to have a second operation.

Other women have hormone treatments before surgery to remove endometriosis, to make
the operation easier for the surgeon to carry out.

The lining of your womb is called the endometrium. Each month, the lining grows thicker

Endometriosis most often grows around:


the ovaries


the fallopian tubes


the outside of your womb


the lining of your pelvis, and


the rectum and bladder, although these are less common.


The patches of endometriosis react to the different hormones your body makes during
your monthly cycle. So they grow thicker each month, then break away and start to
bleed (like the lining of your womb does when you have your period).

Your body slowly gets rid of the blood, but it can damage the surrounding area. You
may get scars.

Women with endometriosis are more likely than other women to have difficulty in getting
pregnant.

Your chance of getting endometriosis increases from when you first get your periods
until you are about 40. After that your chance of getting endometriosis decreases.

What are the symptoms?
The two main symptoms of endometriosis are pain and difficulty getting pregnant. But
some women don't have any symptoms at all.

Most women with endometriosis get pain in the pelvis. The pain can be severe or it
may be a dull ache. Some women get the pain all the time. Others get pain only at
certain times: for example:



during sex


when going to the toilet,


or during their period.


Pain during your periods is very common. If you have endometriosis, you may find that
the pain is continuous throughout your period, and gets worse over time.

Some women with endometriosis have other symptoms, such as:


exhaustion and feeling generally unwell


trouble sleeping, and


depression.


Many women with endometriosis can get pregnant naturally. But about one-third of women
who have been diagnosed with endometriosis need medical help to get pregnant.

For some women, having difficulty getting pregnant is when they first realise that
they have endometriosis.

If you have symptoms that suggest that you might have endometriosis, your doctor might
examine you, or send you for an ultrasound scan.

But the only way to be sure you that have endometriosis is to have a small operation
called a laparoscopy. The surgeon looks inside your body with a tiny camera on a tube.
If the results show endometriosis, you may be able to have surgical treatment at the
same time.

Not everyone needs a laparoscopy. Your doctor might suggest treatments based on your
symptoms.

What will happen to me?
If you don't get treatment, your endometriosis could get gradually worse, then get
better when you go through the menopause. This happens to about half the women who
get endometriosis.

Some women's symptoms improve after a time without treatments. This happens to about
a third of women who have mild endometriosis.

Most women who have treatments get good relief from pain. Unfortunately, the pain
often comes back sooner or later. But if your pain comes back, you can have more treatment.

This information tells you about an operation to burn away the lining of your womb.
It explains: how the operation is done, how it can help, what the risks are, and what
to expect afterwards.

You can use our information to discuss your treatment with the doctors and nurses
caring for you.

What is endometrial ablation?
Endometrial ablation is an operation to destroy the lining of the womb. The endometrium is the medical term for the womb lining. Ablation means to destroy.

The microwave method is one of several types of endometrial ablation. The method you
are offered will depend on what is used in your area, and perhaps on the particular
expertise of your surgeon.

If you have microwave endometrial ablation, a surgeon uses heat to burn away the lining
of your womb (uterus).

A long, thin instrument is carefully placed inside your womb through your vagina.
It's heated up using microwaves, which destroy the womb lining.

Why might I need endometrial ablation?
To make your periods lighter
Endometrial ablation is a treatment for heavy menstrual periods. Heavy periods are
a very common problem. Each year about 1 in 20 women see their doctor because of heavy
periods.

Each month, the lining of your womb thickens. During your period your womb lining
comes away and is passed through your vagina with some blood.

You lose about seven to eight teaspoonfuls of blood during a normal period. But during
a heavy period you can lose more than twice that amount.

One way to reduce the amount of blood and tissue you lose is to remove the lining
of your womb. It's not easy to measure exactly how much blood you, as an individual,
lose during your period. But you and your doctor might think about an operation if
you:



use more than nine pads or tampons (or both pads and tampons) on your heaviest days


have to wear both a tampon and a pad


have periods that regularly last more than six days


need to get up at night to change your protection


pass clumps of blood (blood clots)


stain your bedding or clothes despite wearing tampons and pads


have 'flooding' (a sudden loss of lots of blood)


stay at home or take time off work during your period.


To make your periods less painful
Some women with heavy periods have a lot of pain each month. This is because the muscles
in the womb tighten so that they can push out the thick lining. If the lining is thinner,
your periods might be less painful.

To improve your quality of life
Heavy periods don't mean there's anything seriously wrong with you. But they can disrupt
your life and make you feel miserable. For example, you might be more likely to:



stay at home during your period because you are worried you won't get to a toilet
in time to change your tampon or pad if you go out



feel tired, especially during your period


feel anxious or depressed, and


have problems with your sex life.


Bleeding less might help you to feel better about yourself and allow your life to
get back to normal.

Is endometrial ablation the right treatment for me?
Your doctor will probably only suggest this operation if treatment with medication
hasn't made your periods lighter. Doctors usually recommend trying a drug treatment
for at least three months before thinking about surgery.

Your doctor might suggest that you try an intrauterine device (IUD). This is a small
device that’s fitted into your womb. It releases a hormone called progesterone, which
helps reduce bleeding.

Your doctor probably won’t suggest surgery unless you have tried an IUD and it hasn’t
helped.

Microwave endometrial ablation isn’t suitable for all women with heavy periods. You
shouldn’t have this operation if:



you want to get pregnant. Pregnancy is possible after this operation, but it’s unsafe
for both mother and baby. Your womb lining will be too thin to give the baby the blood
supply it needs to develop.

There is also a chance that the baby will grow in the tubes that carry eggs from your
ovaries to your womb (fallopian tubes). This is called an ectopic pregnancy. Ectopic
pregnancies cannot develop safely and have to be terminated



you want to be certain that your periods will stop. You'll need to have your womb
removed (a hysterectomy) to guarantee this.



What will happen?
Preparing for the operation
A month before the operation, your doctor might give you a hormone treatment to thin
your womb lining so it's easier to remove it. This might be a single injection or
a course of pills.

If your operation is planned for just after your period, you might not need hormone
treatment.

About one hour before the operation you'll be given a pain-killing drug. This is usually
given as a pill that's put into your rectum through your anus (called a suppository),
but you might be given a pill to swallow.

You will then have either a local anaesthetic (which means you won't feel anything
during the operation, but you will be awake) or a general anaesthetic (which means
you will be asleep during the operation).

If you have a local anaesthetic, your surgeon will inject your cervix (the opening
of your womb) to make it numb. You or your surgeon might prefer a general anaesthetic,
especially if you're anxious.

The operation
This operation should:


shrink the womb lining by burning away the tissue


make the blood in your womb lining sticky (it 'coagulates')


destroy cells that help the lining to grow again each month. Without this layer of
cells, the lining doesn't get so thick, so your periods are lighter.



The operation usually takes about 20 minutes. Most women are able to go home within
a few hours. During the operation:



the cervix is carefully widened so that the operating equipment can fit through. Instruments
called dilators are put into your cervix, one at a time.

The surgeon starts with a dilator 2 millimetres wide, and then replaces it with one
3 millimetres wide and so on, until your cervix is open to a width of 9 millimetres
(about one-third of an inch)



your surgeon will then insert a long, thin instrument into your vagina, then through
your open cervix and into your womb



you might have an ultrasound scan to check that the instrument is in the right place


when the surgeon switches on the instrument, the microwaves come out of the tip and
heat up the womb lining one area at a time. The tip has a heat sensor, and the temperature
is displayed on a TV monitor.

When the temperature reaches a certain point the surgeon knows that that part of the
womb lining has been destroyed.

The surgeon then moves on to the next area. The instrument is moved from side to side
and gradually pulled out until all the lining of your womb has been destroyed.



If you feel any pain during the operation, the surgeon can give you another drug to
help you relax (a sedative). Or you might be given pain-killing nitrous oxide (also
known as 'gas and air') to breathe.

You won't need any stitches or dressings after this kind of surgery.
What are the risks?
All operations have risks, and your surgeon should discuss with you the risks of this
operation before you have it.

You might be more likely to have problems with this operation if:


the wall of your womb is thinner than usual, or


you've had a caesarean section or other surgery on your womb that has left a scar.


If either of these applies to you, your doctor might advise you not to have this operation
and to try different treatments instead.

Anaesthetics
One common side effect of surgery is nausea (feeling sick) caused by anaesthetics.
But this goes away fairly quickly.

It is also possible, but rare, to have an allergic reaction to anaesthetics. It's
important to tell your doctor before your operation if you have any allergies.

Other possible problems
Other complications can happen during or soon after this type of surgery. They include:


damage to the womb. The instrument used in this operation can make a small hole (a
perforation) in the womb. This is rare, and most perforations heal by themselves over
time. But some women need surgery to repair the damage



very heavy bleeding (haemorrhage). Some women bleed heavily during the operation or
afterwards. If this happens, you might need a blood transfusion



a large build-up of blood called a haematoma. If you bleed a lot during the operation,
blood can form a solid swollen lump at the top of your vagina or in your abdomen.
This lump might go down by itself, but some women need surgery to drain off the blood



burns caused by the microwaves. These are rare but they can happen in your vagina,
your cervix, or bowel. Burns to the bowel can be serious, and the damage will need
to be repaired



infection. This is a risk with any surgery. You might be given antibiotics after the
operation to help prevent infection



problems with the equipment. If the equipment doesn’t work properly during your operation,
your surgery might take longer or be delayed.



Endometrial ablation works well for most women. But some women find that they have
heavy periods again after a while.

This is because it’s sometimes hard to remove all the cells that help your womb lining
grow. If some cells are left behind, then the lining can re-grow and your periods
can become heavy again. Some women need more treatment within a year.

Pain
You won't feel any pain during the operation, but you might be sore for a few days
afterwards. Painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen can help.

If you have a lot of pain after surgery it's important to tell the nurse or your doctor.
It can be a sign of infection or of damage to your womb or other organs nearby.

What can I expect afterwards?
If you had a local anaesthetic, you might feel well enough to go home within an hour
of the operation. It takes longer to recover after a general anaesthetic, but you
should still be able to go home the same day.

You'll need to stay at home and take it easy for a day or so. You might have some
cramps (like bad period pains) that last for up to four hours after the operation.

Painkillers such as ibuprofen and paracetamol should help. Your doctor might also
give you antibiotics to prevent infection.

You might feel a bit sore and uncomfortable the next day, but this rarely lasts for
longer than a week. You will have a watery discharge from your vagina for about three
weeks after the operation, but you might not have any bleeding.

Rules about driving vary from country to country, but in many places you can drive
again the day after this surgery. You should check the rules where you live.

You should be back to your normal activities within a few days. But you might want
to wait to have sex until the watery discharge has stopped.

It's harder to get pregnant after this surgery, but it does sometimes happen. You
should continue to use your normal contraception.

Some women find that their periods stop completely after this surgery."

This information tells you about an operation to remove the lining of your womb using
heat.

It explains: how the operation is done, how it can help, what the risks are, and what
to expect afterwards.

You can use our information to discuss your treatment with your doctor. If you choose
to have this operation, bear in mind that methods and procedures can vary slightly
between hospitals.

What is endometrial ablation with diathermy?
Endometrial ablation is an operation to destroy the lining of the womb:


The endometrium is the medical term for the womb lining.



Ablation means to destroy.



Diathermy means that the womb lining is removed using heat from an electric current.



There are several different types of endometrial ablation, some of them newer than
the diathermy method.

You might be offered treatment using one of these newer methods, which have shorter
recovery times and don’t need general anaesthetics. But diathermy can still be the
most suitable option for some women.

If you have endometrial ablation with diathermy, a surgeon uses a heated wire loop
or a rollerball (a ball on the end of a handle) to cut or burn away the lining of
your womb.

During the operation, the surgeon sees what's happening through a tiny telescope (called
a hysteroscope) put inside your womb through your vagina.

Why might I need endometrial ablation?
To make your periods lighter
Endometrial ablation is a treatment for heavy menstrual periods. Heavy periods are
a common problem. Each year about 1 in 20 women see their doctor because of heavy
periods.

Each month, the lining of your womb thickens. During your period your womb lining
comes away and is passed through your vagina with some blood.

You lose about seven to eight teaspoonfuls of blood during a normal period. But during
a heavy period you can lose more than twice that amount.

One way to reduce the amount of blood and tissue you lose is to remove the lining
of your womb. It's not easy to measure exactly how much blood you, as an individual,
lose during your period. But you and your doctor might think about an operation if
you:



use more than nine pads or tampons (or both pads and tampons) on your heaviest days


have to wear both a tampon and a pad


have periods that regularly last more than six days


need to get up at night to change your protection


pass clumps of blood (blood clots)


stain your bedding or clothes despite wearing tampons and pads


have 'flooding' (a sudden loss of lots of blood)


stay at home or take time off work during your period.


To make your periods less painful
Some women with heavy periods have a lot of pain each month. This is because the muscles
in the womb tighten so that they can push out the thick lining. If the lining is thinner,
your periods might be less painful.

To improve your quality of life
Heavy periods don't mean there's anything seriously wrong with you. But they can disrupt
your life and make you feel miserable. For example, you might be more likely to:



stay at home during your period because you are worried you won't get to a toilet
in time to change your tampon or pad if you go out



feel tired, especially during your period


feel anxious or depressed, and


have problems with your sex life.


Bleeding less might help you to feel better about yourself and allow your life to
get back to normal.

Is endometrial ablation the right treatment for me?
Your doctor will probably only suggest this operation if treatment with medication
hasn't made your periods lighter. Doctors usually recommend trying a drug treatment
for at least three months before thinking about surgery.

Your doctor might suggest that you try an intrauterine device (IUD). This is a small
device that’s fitted into your womb. It releases a hormone called progesterone, which
helps reduce bleeding.

Your doctor probably won’t suggest surgery unless you have tried an IUD and it hasn’t
helped.

Diathermy endometrial ablation isn’t suitable for all women with heavy periods. You
shouldn’t have this operation if:



you want to get pregnant. Pregnancy is possible after this operation, but it’s unsafe
for both mother and baby. Your womb lining will be too thin to give the baby the blood
supply it needs to develop.

There is also a chance that the baby will grow in the tubes that carry eggs from your
ovaries to your womb (fallopian tubes). This is called an ectopic pregnancy. Ectopic
pregnancies cannot develop safely and have to be terminated



you want to be certain that your periods will stop. You'll need to have your womb
removed (a hysterectomy) to guarantee this.



What will happen?
Preparing for the operation
A month before the operation, your doctor might give you a hormone treatment to thin
your womb lining so it's easier to remove it. This might be a single injection or
a course of pills.

This operation is usually done with a general anaesthetic, so you won't be awake or
feel any pain. You'll be asleep for 20 minutes to 40 minutes.

The operation
This operation should:


shrink the womb lining by burning away the tissue


make the blood in your womb lining sticky (it 'coagulates')


destroy cells that help the lining to grow again each month. Without this layer of
cells, the lining doesn't get so thick, so your periods are lighter.



During the operation:


the cervix is carefully widened so that the operating equipment can fit through. Instruments
called dilators are put into your cervix, one at a time.

The surgeon starts with a dilator 2 millimetres wide, and then replaces it with one
3 millimetres wide and so on, until your cervix is open to a width of 9 millimetres
(about one-third of an inch)



your surgeon then puts a tiny telescope (hysteroscope) into your womb through your
vagina and cervix so he or she can see what's happening during the operation



the heating device is then placed inside your womb. The device might be a wire loop
or a rollerball. Surgeons often use both. The wire loop is around 6 millimetres long
and is attached at an angle to a pencil-shaped handle. The rollerball is a ball about
2 millimetres wide that rotates freely on its handle



the loop or rollerball is heated using electricity


using a wire loop, the surgeon cuts away slivers of your womb lining. Where your womb
lining is thinner, including the corners of your womb, it's usually safer for the
surgeon to use the rollerball to burn away the tissue



after cutting away the womb lining with the wire loop, the surgeon may go over the
surface with the rollerball. The blood becomes sticky (coagulates) and seals up the
blood vessels



fluid is continuously pumped into your womb during the operation to keep it swollen.
This helps the surgeon to see inside your womb, and washes out blood and tissue. A
close check is kept on how much fluid goes into your womb and how much washes out,
so your surgeon knows if you are absorbing too much.



You won’t need any stitches or dressings after this surgery.
You might hear your doctor or surgeon use different terms to describe the surgery
depending on which instruments they use.



Surgery that uses only the wire loop to cut away (or resect) the womb lining is called
transcervical endometrial resection.



Surgery that uses the heated rollerball to burn away the tissue is called rollerball ablation. A combination of the two is often used.



What are the risks?
All operations have risks, and your surgeon should discuss with you the risks of this
operation before you have it.

You might be more likely to have problems with this operation if:


the wall of your womb is thinner than usual, or


you've had a caesarean section or other surgery on your womb that has left a scar.


If either of these applies to you, your doctor might advise you not to have this operation
and to try different treatments instead.

Anaesthetics
One common side effect of surgery is nausea (feeling sick) caused by anaesthetics.
But this goes away fairly quickly.

It is also possible, but rare, to have an allergic reaction to anaesthetics. It's
important to tell your doctor before your operation if you have any allergies.

Other possible problems
Other complications can happen during or soon after this type of surgery. They include:


damage to the womb. The instrument used in this operation can make a small hole (a
perforation) in the womb. This is rare, and most perforations heal by themselves over
time. But some women need surgery to repair the damage



very heavy bleeding (haemorrhage). Some women bleed heavily during the operation or
afterwards. If this happens, you might need a blood transfusion



a large build-up of blood called a haematoma. If you bleed a lot during the operation,
blood can form a solid swollen lump at the top of your vagina or in your abdomen.
This lump might go down by itself, but some women need surgery to drain off the blood



injury to the bowel. The bowel is close to the womb and can sometimes be burned by
the heated instrument in the womb



infection. This is a risk with any surgery. You might be given antibiotics after the
operation to help prevent infection



absorbing too much of the fluid that’s pumped into your womb during the surgery. The
surgeon will stop the operation if you've absorbed too much fluid into your bloodstream,
because this can make you ill.



Endometrial ablation works well for most women. But some women find that they have
heavy periods again after a while.

This is because it’s sometimes hard to remove all the cells that help your womb lining
grow. If some cells are left behind, then the lining can re-grow and your periods
can become heavy again. Some women need more treatment within a year.

If you've been sterilised before you have rollerball ablation, this can make you more
likely to suffer pain in your pelvis and to need a hysterectomy. This is known as
postablation tubal sterilisation syndrome.

Pain
You won't feel any pain during the operation, but you might be sore for a few days
afterwards. Painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen can help.

If you have a lot of pain after surgery it's important to tell the nurse or your doctor.
It can be a sign of infection or of damage to your womb or other organs nearby.

What can I expect afterwards?
It takes a few hours to recover after a general anaesthetic, but you should be able
to go home the same day. People rarely have to stay in hospital overnight after this
operation.

You'll need to stay at home and take it easy for a day or so. You might have some
cramps (like bad period pains) that last for up to four hours after the operation.

Painkillers such as ibuprofen and paracetamol should help. Your doctor might also
give you antibiotics to prevent infection.

You will have a watery discharge from your vagina for about three weeks after the
operation, but you might not have any bleeding.

Rules about driving vary from country to country, but in many places you can drive
again the day after this surgery. You should check the rules where you live.

You should be back to your normal activities within a few days. But you might want
to wait to have sex until the watery discharge has stopped.

If you are having hormone replacement therapy, you can continue to take it after this
operation.

It's harder to get pregnant after this surgery, but it does sometimes happen. You
should continue to use your normal contraception.

Some women find that their periods stop completely after this surgery."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1493885042142/Endocarditis,Endocarditis,"Endocarditis Last published: Dec 06, 2021
If you have endocarditis, the inner lining of your heart is inflamed (swollen). This
usually happens because of an infection. Endocarditis can be life-threatening. However,
treatment with medicines and sometimes surgery can get rid of the infection and help
your heart to recover.

What is endocarditis?
Endocarditis usually happens when germs from another part of your body enter your
bloodstream (for example, through a cut in your mouth) and cause an infection in the
inner lining of your heart. The infection is most likely to affect your heart valves,
which control the flow of blood through your heart by opening and closing.

Endocarditis is usually caused by germs called bacteria, although it can also sometimes
be caused by a fungus, such as Candida (the fungus that causes thrush).

Normally, these germs pass through your heart without causing an infection. However,
they are more likely to stay in your heart and multiply if you have an area that is
damaged or irregular. For example, you have a higher chance of getting endocarditis
if you:



Have a heart valve that is damaged, or has been replaced with an artificial valve




Have a heart defect


Have had a heart transplant.


You also have a raised chance of getting endocarditis if you inject drugs and don’t
use a clean needle. This can allow germs to enter your bloodstream.

Other ways germs can get into your bloodstream include:


Through your mouth, particularly if your teeth and gums aren’t healthy


From infections elsewhere in your body, such as skin infections


Through some types of dental and medical procedures. If your doctor thinks you have
a high risk of getting endocarditis, he or she may recommend that you take medicines
that kill bacteria (antibiotics) before certain procedures. However, not all doctors
recommend this, as it’s not clear whether it is helpful.



Endocarditis can affect people of any age, but about half of people who get it are
over age 60. More men get endocarditis than women.

If you have endocarditis, it’s important to get treatment as soon as possible, as
the condition can cause serious problems throughout your body, including:



Damage to your heart valves, leading to heart failure (this means your heart can’t
pump blood around your body as well as it should)



The spread of the infection to other parts of your body


Small clots or pieces of the infection breaking off, travelling through your bloodstream,
and blocking blood flow to a part of your body, such as your lungs, heart, or brain.
If blood flow to your brain is blocked, this can cause a stroke.



What are the symptoms?
The most common symptoms of endocarditis include:


Fever and chills


Night sweats


A general feeling of being unwell (malaise)


Tiredness (fatigue)


Loss of appetite


Weight loss


Joint pain


Weakness


Headache


Shortness of breath.


Less commonly, people get red, painful spots on the pads of their fingers or toes
(called Osler nodes), or red patches on their palms or soles (called Janeway lesions).


Doctors usually can’t diagnose endocarditis based on symptoms alone. This is because
many of the symptoms of endocarditis – such as fever and fatigue – can be caused by
other illnesses, too.

To make the diagnosis, your doctor will consider whether you have a raised chance
of having endocarditis (for example, if you have an artificial heart valve). You will
also have tests, which will probably include:



Blood and urine tests, including a series of blood tests (called blood cultures) to
check for germs that can cause endocarditis. If you do have endocarditis, knowing
what type of bacteria or fungus is causing the infection will help guide your treatment




An ECG (electrocardiogram), which shows how your heart is beating


An echocardiogram, which is an ultrasound scan to produce a picture of your heart.




What treatments work?
The main treatments for endocarditis are medicines to kill the germs that are causing the infection. About 50 in every 100 people also need surgery to completely remove the infected tissue and repair their heart.

Medicines to kill germs
Endocarditis is usually caused by bacteria. Antibiotics are medicines that kill bacteria. There are many different types of antibiotics,
and you may be treated with more than one. Which antibiotic (or antibiotics) your
doctor prescribes will depend on:



What type of bacteria are causing your infection


Whether the infection is affecting an artificial heart valve.


If your infection is caused by a fungus, you will instead be treated with medicines
called antifungals.

Regardless of what treatment you have, you will probably have the medicine put directly
into a vein through a drip (also called an intravenous infusion, or IV for short),
or given through an injection.

Both antibiotics and antifungals can sometimes cause side effects, such as an upset
stomach or a rash. Your doctor will carefully monitor how well these treatments are
working and whether they are causing any problems.

Surgery
Many people with endocarditis need to have surgery. The goal of surgery is to remove
all the infected tissue and repair the heart, which often involves repairing or replacing
any affected heart valves. This will help your heart to recover and work normally
again.

All surgeries have risks, including the chance of bleeding and infection. Your healthcare
team will discuss these risks with you.

Other treatments
If you are very ill, you will also have other treatments to help your body recover
and to address any urgent problems. These treatments may include extra fluids provided
through a drip (IV), help with breathing, and treatments to help with other problems,
such as heart failure.

What will happen?
Many people recover from endocarditis. However, it’s important to seek treatment as
soon as possible, as endocarditis can sometimes cause serious problems, which can
be fatal.

Once you’ve had endocarditis, you have a raised chance of getting it again. So it’s
important that you and those close to you know the symptoms, so you can seek treatment
straight away.

If you have any questions or concerns, be sure to discuss these with your doctor."

https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1558426621012/Eczema,Eczema,"Eczema Last published: Jan 30, 2023
Eczema can make skin itchy, red, and sore. It can happen at any age but it is more
common in children. It can be distressing for you to see your child uncomfortable.
But there are treatments that can help relieve the symptoms.

You can use our information to talk to your doctor and decide which treatments are
right for you or your child.

What is eczema?
Eczema is a condition that makes patches of skin become dry, red, and itchy. Scratching
the skin can make it bleed and become thick and scaly.

There are several types of eczema. The most common is atopic eczema, also sometimes
called atopic dermatitis. The information here is about atopic eczema, but we call it just 'eczema'.

If something is atopic it means it's linked to an allergy. If you have an allergy
your immune system (the parts of your body that fight infection) over-reacts to certain
things that shouldn't usually cause you problems.

Common things that trigger allergic reactions in people with eczema are pollen, animal
skin and fur, feathers, some soaps and detergents, stress, and their own sweat. But
you might never know what causes your or your child’s symptoms.

What are the symptoms?
Eczema can make skin:


itchy


pink or red


dry and flaky


broken and bleeding


thick and tough.


When eczema symptoms suddenly get worse your doctor might call this a flare-up.

In children, the parts of the body where they get eczema might change as they get
older. Babies often have eczema on their cheeks and chin. Children tend to get it
on the inside of the elbows, behind the knees, and on the wrists, ankles, and hands.


Eczema can cause skin to get infected. If this happens it can cause:


bumps filled with pus


crusty yellow blisters


wet and oozing areas of skin where the blisters have burst.


If you think your skin (or your child's skin) is infected, see your doctor. Infections
usually need to be treated with antibiotics. Antibiotics are medicines that kill the
bacteria causing the infection and prevent it spreading.

What treatments are available?
Doctors will recommend treatments depending on how severe someone's symptoms are.
You might have to try several treatments until you find what works best.

It's important to remember that eczema is what doctors call a 'chronic' condition.
This means that it is likely to last a long time. So you need to carry on with your
(or your child's) regular skin-care routine even during spells when the eczema seems
to have gone away.

You should also avoid things that trigger flare-ups, such as things that irritate
your skin, or certain foods that cause problems.

If you have a child with eczema you might find it helpful to follow a set of written
instructions on skin care, bathtime routines, and other things that help.

First things to try
One of the best things you can do is to use plenty of moisturiser every day. This treatment is recommended for everyone with eczema, regardless of
what other treatments they might need.

Moisturisers come as lotions, ointments, creams, and bath oils. Doctors might call
them emollients. They work in two ways:



First, they form a barrier between the skin and whatever is causing an allergic reaction.


Second, they help keep the skin moist, which helps reduce pain and itching.


You can use as much moisturiser as you like and repeat as needed.
You might find it helps to apply a moisturiser after a bath or shower because it helps
to 'lock' water into the skin. Using bath oil in the bath or shower beforehand can
help this process. Ointments are usually used on very dry skin.

Some people find that moisturisers are the only treatment they need. But most people
will need to use them alongside another treatment.

Corticosteroid creams and lotions are often used alongside moisturisers to help treat eczema and stop it flaring up.
Corticosteroids (usually just called steroids) are powerful anti-inflammatories that
help to reduce inflammation (swelling) and its effects.

Steroid creams are useful during a flare-up of symptoms. They can help reduce inflammation
and itching when this happens. But some people need to keep using a low-dose steroid
cream regularly to help prevent flare-ups.

Steroid creams come in different strengths. Your doctor will want to prescribe the
lowest-strength steroid that works for you or your child, because they can cause side
effects.

So, depending on how severe the symptoms are, you will probably start with a low-strength
cream and move onto a stronger one if you need to.

You apply a thin layer of the steroid cream or lotion to the affected skin. Put the
cream or lotion on in the way your doctor shows you.

Steroids might sting or irritate your skin at first. Some people worry that steroids
can make skin thinner. But this only tends to be a problem with high-dose steroid
creams when used for a long time.

For severe symptoms your doctor might recommend cream that contains drugs called calcineurin inhibitors, either on their own or alongside steroid cream. Calcineurin inhibitors work by stopping
your immune system from over-reacting to things that cause an allergic reaction.

These drugs should not be used in children under 2 years old.
If skin becomes infected your doctor will prescribe antibiotics, probably as a cream.

If the first treatments don't work
If symptoms don't improve with corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors there are
other treatments your doctor might recommend.



Ultraviolet (UV) therapy. Some people notice that their eczema improves after exposure to sunlight (which
contains UV light). UV can also be given by a special light box.

It's important not to use the light box any more than your doctor prescribes, because
too much exposure to UV can cause sunburn and, sometimes, skin cancer. This treatment
is sometimes used in combination with a drug called psoralen, which makes the skin
more sensitive to UV.



Immunosuppressive drugs reduce the immune system's reaction to things that cause allergies. There are several
types, including tablet forms of the calcineurin inhibitors discussed above.

Some of these drugs are suitable for children as well as in adults. But doctors usually
only prescribe them for people with the most severe symptoms as they can cause side
effects.



Separate treatments for itching
If you find that the itching that eczema causes bothers you a lot, even with treatments
that reduce the other symptoms, talk to your doctor about treatments that might help.

For example, your doctor may recommend emollients that contain substances called ceramides. They might be better than standard moisturisers at controlling itching.

Antihistamines have sometimes been used to treat eczema. But they are usually not recommended, as there is no good evidence that they work. It has been suggested that they help
reduce itching at night, so that they sleep better. But any effect is probably just
because some antihistamines can make you drowsy.

What will happen?
About 6 in 10 children grow out of their eczema or have milder symptoms as they grow
older. But sometimes eczema can come back when you are an adult, often on your hands.


Where to get more help
Very bad eczema can be distressing, especially for children. Your doctor might be
able to put you in touch with support groups in your area. Or you can search for them
online.

For example, in the UK, the National Eczema Society (eczema.org) might be able to
put you in touch with other parents in your area, to find out how they manage. It
also provides regular updates of the latest research on eczema."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/3000006/Ectopic%20pregnancy%3A%20what%20treatments%20work%3F,Ectopic pregnancy: what treatments work?,"Ectopic pregnancy: what treatments work? Last published: Sep 02, 2021
An ectopic pregnancy happens when a fertilised egg starts to develop in a part of
a woman’s body other than the womb. Without treatment, ectopic pregnancy can be dangerous
for the mother.

What treatments work?
In a healthy pregnancy an egg fertilised with sperm travels from the woman’s ovary,
along one of her two fallopian tubes, to the womb (uterus) where it develops into
a fetus. But sometimes the egg starts to develop in the wrong place, usually the fallopian
tube.

The main danger of ectopic pregnancy is that, as the egg grows, it will rupture (break)
the wall of the fallopian tube. This can cause internal bleeding that, in some cases,
can be fatal for the woman.

For more background information, see our leaflet Ectopic pregnancy: what is it?
The treatment you need will depend on whether your doctor thinks you are at risk of
internal bleeding from damage to your fallopian tube.

Expectant management
If you are otherwise healthy and your doctor thinks that your pregnancy will probably
end by itself, he or she might recommend what’s called expectant management.

This means that your doctor will keep a close eye on you, but you won’t have any medical
treatment unless there are signs that your pregnancy is not going to end by itself.


You will need to have regular blood tests until these show that you aren’t pregnant
any more. In most women who agree to this approach, the pregnancy ends by itself without
any problems.

Drug treatment
The main treatment for ending a dangerous ectopic pregnancy is a drug called methotrexate.
This is given by injection.

Many women just need one injection, but some women will need to have several injections
a few days apart for the treatment to work. After the first injection you will need
regular blood tests to make sure that the treatment is working.

Some women are not able to have methotrexate injections, including women who have:




problems with their immune systems


severe liver disease


severe kidney disease


serious lung problems


some blood diseases, including anaemia and leukopenia (where people don’t have enough
white blood cells, which makes them less able to fight infections).



If you have any of these problems you may need to have surgery to end your ectopic
pregnancy.

Surgery
The aim of surgery is usually to remove the pregnancy before it becomes large enough
to damage the fallopian tube. You will need to have surgery if:



methotrexate has not worked or if you can’t have methotrexate because of another medical
problem



the ectopic pregnancy is large enough that it is likely to damage your fallopian tube




your fallopian tube has already been damaged.


In the operation, which is done under general anaesthetic, the surgeon will pass a
tiny camera through a small cut in your abdomen. The camera will show if there is
any damage to the fallopian tube.

If the fallopian tube is damaged, or if you have had an ectopic pregnancy before in
the same tube, the surgeon will probably need to remove the tube along with the pregnancy.
But if your other fallopian tube is still healthy you might still be able to become
pregnant in the future.

If the fallopian tube is not damaged the surgeon will probably be able to remove just
the pregnancy.

What will happen?
You will need to have weekly blood tests, and possibly urine tests, until your doctor
is sure that your pregnancy has ended and all the tissue has passed out on its own
or been properly removed during surgery.

If you become pregnant again after having had an ectopic pregnancy you should see
your doctor as soon as possible to check that the pregnancy is growing normally and
in the right place.

An ectopic pregnancy happens when a fertilised egg starts to develop in a part of
a woman’s body other than the womb. Without treatment, ectopic pregnancy can be dangerous
for the mother.
What is ectopic pregnancy?
In a healthy pregnancy an egg fertilised with sperm travels from the woman’s ovary,
along one of her two fallopian tubes, to the womb (uterus) where it develops into
a fetus. But sometimes the egg starts to develop in the wrong place, usually the fallopian
tube.

The main danger of ectopic pregnancy is that, as the egg grows, it will rupture (break)
the wall of the fallopian tube. This can cause internal bleeding that, in some cases,
can be fatal for the woman.

It can be extremely distressing to have to end a pregnancy, especially if you have
been trying to become pregnant. But an egg that starts to develop outside the womb
cannot develop into a normal fetus and will not be able to live.

Sometimes this type of pregnancy will end by itself. But many women need drug treatment
or surgery to end the pregnancy.

One or two in every 100 pregnancies are ectopic. Most ectopic pregnancies happen for
no known reason. But some things can make them more likely. These include:



having had a previous ectopic pregnancy


having had an infection in the pelvis


smoking


using a type of contraceptive called an intrauterine device (IUD)


having had a lot of different sexual partners in your life


having previously had surgery on your fallopian tubes


having had fertility problems before


having previously had in vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment


being aged over 35


having African-Caribbean ancestry.


Another possible cause of ectopic pregnancy is having been exposed in the womb to
a drug called diethylstilbestrol (DES). This is a drug that was given to pregnant
women in some countries for some years up to the 1970s. For you to have been exposed,
your mother must have taken this drug while pregnant with you.

What are the symptoms?
The most common symptoms of ectopic pregnancy are:


abdominal (tummy) pain and tenderness


not having had a menstrual period for a month or two


unusual vaginal bleeding.


If your doctor thinks you might have an ectopic pregnancy he or she will ask you about
your symptoms and about other things that might make ectopic pregnancy more likely,
such as having had one before.

Your doctor will also examine you physically. But he or she might not be able to tell
much from this. You will probably need to have two types of test:



A pregnancy test, to tell whether you are pregnant. This could be a urine test or
a blood test, or possibly both.



An ultrasound scan. If you are pregnant this will detect whether the pregnancy is
developing inside or outside the uterus.



While an ultrasound can show if your pregnancy is not developing in the uterus, it
might not be able to show where exactly it is developing. Most ectopic pregnancies
develop in the fallopian tube. But they can also develop in other places, including
the ovary and the abdomen.

What will happen?
With treatment, an ectopic pregnancy can be safely ended. For more information on
treatments for ectopic pregnancy, see our leaflet Ectopic pregnancy: what treatments work?

If you become pregnant again after having had an ectopic pregnancy you should see
your doctor as soon as possible to check that the pregnancy is growing normally and

Ebola is a serious, often fatal infection caused by a virus. It was first recorded
in Africa, where there have been several outbreaks since the illness was identified
in 1976.

Ebola is a frightening illness, as many people who become infected die from it. The
risk of getting Ebola is a very real concern for people living in, or travelling in,
countries with outbreaks of the illness, and for health professionals treating those
who become infected.

However, for people in countries a long way from Africa, including the UK, the chance
of getting Ebola is extremely small.

Key things to know about Ebola


Ebola is spread through direct contact with body fluids from a person who is infected
– but only once that person has symptoms. These fluids include blood, urine, faeces,
and vomit.



Ebola is not spread through the air (for example, when someone coughs or sneezes)
or through casual contact (for example, being in the same building as someone with
Ebola or passing them on the street).



Ebola symptoms develop within 21 days of the virus entering a person’s body. So if
someone exposed to the virus hasn’t developed symptoms within this time, then they
have not been infected.



If you think you may have been exposed to the virus and you start feeling unwell,
seek medical attention immediately and make it clear that you may have come in contact
with the virus. People who are diagnosed and cared for quickly have a better chance
of surviving the illness.



There is now a vaccine that is being used in the areas where it is most likely to
be needed.



Most treatment for Ebola focuses on ‘supportive care’. This means treating the person's
symptoms (such as fever and pain), making sure they don’t become low on fluids (dehydrated),
and managing other problems that the infection causes in their body.



Antiviral treatments to treat ebola are becoming available. They are not a cure for
everyone, but research suggests that people given these treatments are more likely
to survive.



What is Ebola?
The full name for Ebola is the Ebola virus disease (EVD). There are four known types
of Ebola virus that can make people ill. The Zaire ebolavirus was responsible for the most recent outbreaks in Africa.

Outbreaks of Ebola are thought to start when infected animals pass on the virus to
people. This can happen if a person has direct contact with an infected animal’s body
fluids or tissue: for example, if they eat food contaminated with an infected animal’s
droppings or handle raw meat from an infected animal.

Animals that can pass on the virus to people include bats, and primates such as chimpanzees
and monkeys.

Once the Ebola virus enters a person’s body, it invades their cells and creates copies
of itself. The cells then burst, allowing the virus to spread. The virus targets cells
that are part of the body’s immune system. In this way, the virus weakens the body’s
natural defences.

Once the immune system is weakened, the virus can cause damage throughout the body,
which can lead to serious bleeding, organ damage, and death.

Unlike other viruses like the common cold and flu, Ebola can’t be passed from person
to person through the air (for example, by coughing or sneezing). Instead, Ebola is
spread through direct contact with body fluids from a person who is infected – but
only once that person has symptoms.

These fluids include blood, urine, faeces, vomit, sweat, saliva, semen, vaginal fluid,
and breast milk.

What are the symptoms?
The first symptoms of Ebola are similar to those of many illnesses caused by viruses.
These include:



a fever (high temperature)


tiredness (fatigue)


loss of appetite


feeling sick or vomiting


diarrhoea


headache


stomach pain


muscle pain


intense weakness


sore throat


chest pain and coughing


unexplained bleeding and bruising.


As the illness gets worse it can cause other symptoms. These may include:


a rash


bleeding


hiccups


confusion


seizures (fits).


How is Ebola diagnosed?
Doctors usually can’t diagnose Ebola based on the symptoms people have. This is because
the early symptoms of Ebola are much like those of common illnesses such as flu. Ebola
symptoms can also resemble those of malaria, which is common in parts of Africa and
many other regions with warm, humid climates.

So doctors usually work out whether someone has Ebola based on three main things:




Their symptoms


How likely they are to have recently come into contact with the virus


The results of blood tests.


Symptoms
Of the symptoms listed above, the most common in recent outbreaks were fever, tiredness,
loss of appetite, vomiting, diarrhoea, and headache. As these symptoms can also be
caused by malaria, doctors often do a blood test to check for this infection. Some
people have malaria as well as Ebola.

Recent exposure to the virus
Doctors can usually rule out Ebola as a cause of someone’s symptoms if the person
hasn’t been living in, or recently travelling in, an area where the virus is widespread.
This is because most people in countries where Ebola hasn’t spread, such as the UK,
have an extremely small chance of getting Ebola.

However, very rarely, people in these countries can get the illness if they have had
close contact with someone with Ebola who travelled from a country where Ebola is
widespread.

People living in, or travelling in, countries with an Ebola outbreak have a much greater
chance of being exposed to the virus. People with the greatest chance of becoming
infected include:



family members of someone with Ebola


health professionals treating Ebola patients


people who have direct contact with the bodies of people who have died of Ebola (for
example, during burials).



Ebola symptoms develop within 21 days of a person being infected with the virus. So
if someone exposed to the virus hasn’t developed symptoms within this time, then they
have not been infected.

Blood tests
If doctors think someone might have Ebola based on their symptoms and their exposure
to the virus, they will do a blood test. This is called a reverse transcriptase-polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) test.

This test can show whether a person has the virus in his or her body. If someone has
a negative test (a test that does not show they have the virus), doctors will repeat
the test within 48 hours to make sure that the person has not been infected.

These blood tests can now be done in the field, using rapid fingerprick tests.
How is Ebola treated?
Treatment for Ebola has two main focuses:


Stopping the infection from spreading to other people (infection control), and


Providing supportive care to help people fight off the infection and recover.


Transfusions of blood from Ebola survivors have also helped some people recover, and
several treatments are being developed, including antiviral medications.

Infection control
When doctors suspect someone has Ebola they take strict precautions to prevent the
virus from spreading. The person is examined, diagnosed, and treated in a private
room, with their own toilet.

When health professionals enter their room they wear protective clothing that covers
their body – including their eyes, head, and hands – so that no skin is exposed. They
follow strict procedures for putting on and taking off this clothing each time they
enter the patient’s room, so that they do not come in contact with the virus.

Supportive care
There is not yet a medicine that can get rid of the Ebola virus. Antibiotics don’t
help, as these medicines kill bacteria, not viruses. So the aim of treatment is to
provide supportive care.

This means keeping the person as comfortable and healthy as possible, giving their
immune system the best chance of fighting off the infection.

Supportive care involves three main things:


Treating the person’s symptoms. People will usually be given paracetamol to help reduce their fever and pain. Stronger
pain relievers, such as morphine, can be used for more severe pain.

People may be given other medicines to help with nausea and vomiting and with other
problems that may develop, such as heartburn and difficulty swallowing. They may also
be given medicines to help with less common symptoms, such as seizures.



Preventing and treating dehydration. Many people with Ebola vomit frequently and have diarrhoea. This means that their
bodies are rapidly losing fluids. If someone becomes very low on fluids (severely
dehydrated), this can cause serious problems.

People may be given special drinks (called rehydration solutions) or have fluids put
directly into a vein through an intravenous infusion (also called an IV, or a drip).




Managing other problems that the infection can cause. Ebola can lead to problems throughout the body. These can include severe bleeding
both inside and outside of the body, organ damage, and organ failure. For severe bleeding,
a person may be given a transfusion of platelets and plasma from someone else’s blood.

Kidney failure is sometimes treated through dialysis (this involves having a machine
take over the work of the kidneys). However, dialysis isn't usually available for
Ebola patients in countries with limited healthcare resources.

People with Ebola may also get a serious problem called sepsis, which causes inflammation
(swelling) throughout the body. This may be caused by a separate infection with bacteria.
Antibiotics are used to treat this.



Blood transfusions from survivors
People who have survived Ebola have developed special proteins in their blood that
kill the virus. These proteins are called antibodies. People who are ill with Ebola
are sometimes given transfusions of blood from survivors so that they can use the
survivors’ antibodies to fight the infection.

Evidence from Ebola outbreaks suggests that this can help people recover from the
illness. However, blood from survivors isn’t always available.

Treatments on the horizon
Several drugs are being developed to help prevent and treat Ebola.


A vaccine has been created to stop people becoming ill if they are exposed to the virus.



Drug treatments are being developed to fight the infection, and some are being used
in the field, in emergency situations.



One promising treatment area is certain antiviral medications. This is not a cure for everyone who receives it. But research suggests that people
given this treatment are more likely to survive.



How can I avoid getting Ebola?
If you are living in, or travelling in, an area with an Ebola outbreak


Frequently wash your hands with soap and water, or use an alcohol-based hand sanitiser


Avoid contact with anyone else’s blood or other body fluids


Do not handle items that have come into contact with an infected person’s body fluids
(for example, clothes, bedclothes, medical equipment, and needles)



Avoid funeral or burial rituals that require handling of the body of someone who has
died from Ebola



Avoid contact with animals that may carry the virus, such as bats, and primates such
as chimpanzees and monkeys. This includes avoiding contact with their body fluids
and raw meat prepared from these animals



If possible, avoid hospitals in outbreak areas where patients with Ebola are being
treated



After travelling in an area with an Ebola outbreak, closely monitor your health for
21 days and seek medical attention immediately if you get possible symptoms, especially
a fever.



If you are a health professional treating someone with Ebola


Wear protective clothing and strictly follow the procedures for putting this clothing
on and taking it off



Use the proper infection-control measures


Avoid direct contact with the body of someone who has died of Ebola


Notify health officials if you have direct contact with the body fluids of an infected
patient.



If you live in the UK or another country where the virus hasn’t spread (where there
isn’t an outbreak)



Unless you have had close contact with someone with Ebola, your chance of getting
Ebola is extremely small. You do not need to take any special steps to protect yourself
from the virus.



What will happen to me if I get Ebola?
Estimates of how many people with Ebola die vary greatly, ranging from 25 in every
100 people to 50 in every 100. If you are infected, your chance of surviving depends
on several things. These include:



which Ebola virus is making you ill. The Zaire ebolavirus is the most deadly. In previous outbreaks it has killed up to 90 in every 100 people
who were infected. But in the more-recent outbreaks more people have survived, with
around 50 in every 100 dying.



how quickly you are diagnosed and treated. Starting supportive care early on can give your body a better chance of getting rid
of the virus.



where you are treated. Most Ebola outbreaks happen in areas with limited healthcare resources. This means
fewer people are able to get good-quality supportive care. People who receive good-quality
care are more likely to recover. Some research suggests that, with better care, the
chance of dying from Ebola is much lower, with less than 40 in every 100 people dying.

https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1571932911174/Ear%20wax,Ear wax,"Ear wax Last published: Sep 02, 2021
Ear wax is not a problem unless it builds up and blocks your ear. But if this happens
it can stop you from hearing properly. You'll need to see a doctor or nurse to have
the wax removed. Usually this is easy and painless.

What happens?
We all make ear wax. Usually the wax moves slowly to the outside of your ear where
you wash it away. But the wax can sometimes build up and block your ear.

Sometimes a build-up of wax can cover your eardrum and make it hard to hear. Your
eardrum is a thin layer of skin that stretches across the end of your ear canal. It
picks up sound from outside.

You are more likely to get problems with ear wax if you wear a hearing aid or use
ear plugs. These can stop the natural flow of ear wax, causing it to build up.

Trying to remove wax yourself with cotton buds or anything else can make the problem
worse. You might push the ear wax further into the ear canal and make it harder to
get out. You might also damage your ear.

What are the symptoms?
If you have a build-up of wax in your ear you may be unable to hear properly through
that ear. If you have a build-up in both ears you may find it difficult to hold a
conversation.

You may also:


have humming, buzzing, or ringing in your ear (tinnitus)


have pain in your ear


feel dizzy.


Your doctor will look into your ear to see whether wax is blocking your ear canal.
What treatments work?
Ear syringing
If ear wax is causing you problems your doctor might suggest that you have your ears
syringed. To do this, a nurse or doctor squirts liquid into your ear through a tube.

This liquid could just be warm water. But there are other ear wax softeners that can
be used. This treatment should soften and move the wax. You'll need to hold a small
basin under your ear for the water and wax that comes out. It will probably take a
few minutes for the plug of ear wax to be moved.

Ear syringing works well. Your doctor may give you ear drops to soften the wax before
syringing.

Ear syringing isn't usually painful. But it can be quite uncomfortable and can make
you feel dizzy. Sometimes ear syringing doesn't work at first, so your doctor or nurse
may need to do it again.

Ear syringing with wax softeners other than water can sometimes cause side effects,
including minor ear infections, pain, short-term hearing loss, and allergic reactions.

You might have seen ear wax softeners that come as drops, that you can buy without a prescription. Some people use these
at home instead of seeing their doctor. But you should not use these drops if you
have a damaged ear drum or any other problems affecting your ears.

Other treatments
If you have a hole in your eardrum, or if ear syringing has not worked, your doctor
or nurse may remove the ear wax using small instruments or suction devices.

What will happen to me?
About a third of people with ear wax plugs find that the wax goes away on its own
after about five days without any treatment. But if your ear or ears are still blocked,
the wax can probably be removed with ear syringing.

If your hearing doesn't improve after you've been treated for an ear wax plug, your
doctor will do more tests to find out what's causing the problem."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1588454611559/Ear%20pain%20during%20air%20travel,Ear pain during air travel,"Ear pain during air travel Last published: Feb 15, 2022
Many people get pain in their ears when they take a flight, especially when the plane
comes in to land. But the pain usually goes away once they're on the ground. There
are some things you can try to stop your ears hurting when you fly.

What causes ear pain during air travel?
You can get pain in your ear during air travel when the air pressure inside your ear
is different from the pressure outside your ear. Usually, a tiny tube called the eustachian
tube keeps the pressure the same. The tube connects the inside of your ear with the
back of your nose. It opens and closes when you swallow or yawn.

But when you travel in an aeroplane, the air pressure around you changes quickly,
especially during take-off and landing. Air pressure is highest near the ground and
lessens as you get higher. You may not be able to swallow fast enough to keep the
pressure inside your ear the same as the pressure outside. This puts pressure on your
eardrum, which is a piece of tissue stretched across your ear canal.

If your eustachian tube is blocked for some reason, it can be especially difficult
to get enough air into your ear. This is more likely if you have a cold or another
infection. It’s also more likely in children, because their eustachian tubes are shorter
and narrower.

What are the symptoms?
Some people get a lot of pain in their ears when they fly, especially during take-off
and landing. But these symptoms usually go away soon after landing.

As well as feeling painful, your ears may also feel blocked. You might feel dizzy
when you stand up, and have problems hearing. Some people get ringing in their ears
(tinnitus).

What treatments work?
If your ears are blocked because you have a cold or another infection, it may be better
not to fly. But you may not want to, or be able to, cancel a holiday or business trip
for this reason. If you have to fly with a cold or with a blocked ear, there are treatments
you can try to reduce your chances of getting ear pain during the flight.

Medicines
Taking a decongestant before a flight may help you avoid ear pain if you're an adult.
However, doctors don't usually recommend this treatment for children, as there’s not
enough research to say whether it helps.

You can buy decongestants from a pharmacy. They come as tablets, syrups, and nasal
sprays. You’ll need to take the decongestant half an hour before take-off.

Decongestants can cause mild side effects. For example, those containing a medicine
called pseudoephedrine can make you feel drowsy and get a dry mouth.

Things you can do for yourself
There’s no good research into these techniques, but you might find them helpful.
Yawning, swallowing, or blowing hard while pinching your nose should help reduce the
pressure in your ears. You should feel your ears 'pop'.

Sucking boiled sweets may help you to swallow more often. However, boiled sweets are
not appropriate for younger children, as they can be a choking hazard. Instead, children
might try drinking a beverage with a straw, and infants might suck on a bottle or
dummy. Older children and adults might also try chewing gum.

Blowing up a special balloon may stop you getting pain during a flight and may help
clear blocked ears after you’ve landed. One product is called Otovent. It can be prescribed
by your doctor or you can buy it from a pharmacist or over the Internet.

The balloon is attached to a small tube. You put the tube in one nostril. You then
blow up the balloon through that nostril, keeping the other nostril closed with a
finger, and keeping your mouth shut. You then stop blowing and breathe normally, and
the air goes out of the balloon. You can repeat the exercise again, using the other
nostril. These balloons are suitable for children as well as adults, although younger
children may find them difficult to use.

What will happen to me?
You'll probably find that the pain in your ears from flying goes away soon after you
land.

It's very unlikely that the pressure will cause a hole in your eardrum (a perforation).
We don't know how often this happens to people who take commercial flights, although
it seems to be extremely rare. Research into people flying in military aircraft showed
that, if they did get a hole in the eardrum, it healed over by itself."

If you have deep vein thrombosis (DVT), it means a blood clot has formed in one of
your deep veins, most likely in your leg. Parts of the clot can break off and travel
to your lungs, which can be dangerous.
DVT is more likely if you can't or don't move about for long periods. This may be
why people have a greater chance of DVT if they go on a long journey, such as a long
flight.

If you've had DVT before, or if you are more likely than most people, you should talk
with your doctor about ways to prevent it before you go on a long trip. Things that
may increase your chance of DVT include:



being older


being very overweight (obese)


having had a recent surgery or injury


having a blood clotting disorder


being pregnant


taking hormone therapy, and


having cancer.


You may need to take medications to reduce your chance of blood clots. Or you may
need to wear special elastic stockings called compression stockings.

These stockings help to keep the blood flowing smoothly through the veins in your
legs, so it’s less likely that a clot will form. Your pharmacist can measure you to
ensure you buy the right size of stockings.

Whether or not you are at high risk, you can do exercises and other things while you
travel that may help prevent DVT.

Here are some of the things experts recommend when travelling.


Don't take sleeping pills. These pills can make you fall deeply asleep so that you
don’t move your legs at all.



Don't drink alcohol, but do drink extra water and other fluids.


Try to exercise your legs while seated. Bend and straighten your legs, feet, and toes
while sitting down, every half hour. Make a circle pattern with each foot in turn.




Press the balls of your feet down hard against the floor or a footrest to increase
the blood flow in your legs.



Avoid sitting still for long periods. If possible, take short walks around the cabin
of your aeroplane or train compartment every 30 to 60 minutes. If you are in a car
or bus, take a short walk whenever you stop for a break. If you are driving, make
sure you schedule regular breaks.



Even if you are not at high risk, you may want to think about wearing compression
stockings. But the stockings are not suitable for everyone, so ask your doctor about
them first.

You should get medical help quickly if you get symptoms of DVT. The main symptoms
are swelling or pain in the calf or thigh of one leg, or both swelling and pain. If
a clot has travelled to your lungs, you may get chest pain or shortness of breath.

If you get DVT because of sitting still on a long-distance journey, you may not notice
any pain or swelling right after the trip. It can take hours or even days or weeks
for you to get any symptoms."

The DTP vaccine is a single injection designed to protect against three diseases.
It boosts the vaccinations that children were given first as babies, and again as
preschool children, against diphtheria, tetanus, and polio.

In the UK, the DTP vaccine is usually given to children at the age of 14 years old.
But vaccination schedules can vary between countries. So in some countries children
may get this vaccine, or a similar one, at a different age.

What is the DTP vaccine?
People are usually given their first vaccinations against diphtheria, tetanus, and polio as young babies, as part of what is sometimes called the 6-in-1 vaccine.

As well as the three diseases mentioned above, the 6-in-1 vaccine covers:


hepatitis B


Hib (Haemophilus influenzae type B), and


pertussis (whooping cough).


Some vaccines give protection for life. But others only protect against infection
for a number of years. By the time children become teenagers, they need to have some
of their vaccinations boosted.

For this reason, the DTP vaccination is sometimes called the 3-in-1 teenage booster.

What is diphtheria?
Diphtheria is an infection that can cause breathing problems, heart failure, paralysis, and
death.

Because of vaccination programmes it has almost disappeared from developed countries
including the UK, the US, and Western Europe. But it is still common in developing
countries where vaccination rates are low.

What is tetanus?
Infection with tetanus causes symptoms including muscle pain and breathing problems. You may sometimes hear
it called lockjaw, because it can make it hard to open your mouth.

You can become infected with tetanus if bacteria get into a wound. Because of vaccination
programmes, tetanus is now very rare in developed countries.

What is polio?
Polio is an infection that can cause muscle weakness and paralysis. It used to be
common all over the world.

Because of successful vaccination programmes, polio has disappeared from most of the
world and is now only found in a few countries in Asia.

Who needs the DTP vaccination?
For the best overall protection from these diseases, people need five doses of vaccination
during their life.

You should have had three of these doses as a baby, and another as a pre-school booster about the age of 3 years old.

The DTP vaccine at age 14 is the final stage of protection for most people. But you
might need another booster later if you:



travel to certain countries


have certain types of injury, or


are not sure of your previous vaccination history. If you think you might not have
had your five lifetime doses, it won’t do you any harm to have another.



Is there anyone who shouldn’t have the vaccine?
Most people can have this vaccine. But your child should not have it if they:


have had a severe allergic reaction to a previous dose of the vaccine, or to any ingredients
of the vaccine



are ill with a fever. If this happens you can arrange for your child to have the vaccine
once they have recovered.



Is it safe?
Many people have this vaccine without any problems. But most vaccines can cause mild
side effects in some people. The most common side effects of the DTP vaccine are:



pain, tenderness, or redness where they had the injection (called the injection site)


slight swelling or a lump at the injection site


dizziness


nausea and vomiting fever, and


headache.


Less common side effects can include:


swollen glands


muscle pain


joint pain


diarrhoea


rash, and


fainting.


Rarely, children can have an allergic reaction to the vaccine. But the medical staff
giving the vaccine are trained in how to treat this.

If your child has a fever after the vaccine, you can give them paracetamol or ibuprofen. But be careful to give the correct dose for their age. But you should never give aspirin to children under 16.

If their symptoms don’t get better, talk to your doctor.
How is the vaccination given?
Like many vaccines, the DTP booster is given as an injection into the upper arm.
How well does the vaccine work?
People who have had all five doses of the vaccine, including the booster at age 14,
have a very high level of protection.

Because of these vaccines, diphtheria, tetanus, and polio are now almost unheard of
in developed countries, and polio has disappeared from all but a few countries."

The DTaP vaccine is a single injection designed to protect against four diseases.
In the UK, DTaP is usually given to children at the age of three years old. It boosts
the vaccinations that children were given first as babies against diphtheria, tetanus,
polio, and pertussis.

Vaccination schedules can vary between countries. So in some countries children might
get this vaccine, or a similar one, at a different age.

What is the DTaP vaccination?
People are usually given their first vaccinations against diphtheria, tetanus, polio, and pertussis as young babies, as part of what is sometimes called the 6-in-1 vaccine.

As well as the four diseases mentioned above, the 6-in-1 vaccine covers:


hepatitis B, and


Hib (Haemophilus influenzae type B).


Some vaccines give protection for life. But others only protect against infection
for a number of years. At three years old, children need to have some of their vaccinations
boosted.

For this reason, the DTaP vaccination is sometimes called the 4-in-1 pre-school booster.

Vaccine variations
It’s worth noting that vaccination schedules can vary between countries, and vaccines
with similar names can be slightly different.

For example, in the US, DTaP stands for diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis. The polio
vaccine is given separately.

What is diphtheria?
Diphtheria is an infection that can cause breathing problems, heart failure, paralysis, and
death.

Because of vaccination programmes it has almost disappeared from developed countries,
including the UK, the US, and Western Europe. But it is still common in developing
countries where vaccination rates are low.

What is tetanus?
Infection with tetanus causes symptoms including muscle pain and breathing problems. You might sometimes
hear it called lockjaw, because it can make it hard to open your mouth.

You can become infected with tetanus if bacteria get into a wound. Vaccination programmes
have made tetanus very rare in developed countries.

What is polio?
Polio is an infection that can cause muscle weakness and paralysis. It used to be common
all over the world.

Because of successful vaccination programmes, polio has disappeared from most of the
world and is now only found in a few countries in Asia.

What is pertussis?
Pertussis is more commonly known as whooping cough. It is an infection that causes symptoms like those of a cold, as well as coughing
that’s followed by a gasping sound.

Pertussis can lead to serious problems, such as dehydration, pneumonia, and seizures
(fits).

While vaccination programmes have made whooping cough much less common, it is still
sometimes found in developed countries.



If your child has symptoms of whooping cough seek medical advice immediately.



If your child seems to be having trouble breathing, or if your child’s lips turn blue,
call an ambulance or go to the nearest emergency department.



Who needs the DTaP vaccination?
For the best overall protection from these diseases, people need several doses of
vaccination during their life.

You should have had three of these doses as a baby. And there is another booster for diphtheria, tetanus, and polio at age 14, which
is often called the 3-in-1 teenage booster.

But you might need another booster later if you:


travel to certain countries


have certain types of injury, or


are unsure of your previous vaccination status. If you’re not sure if you had all
the recommended doses as a child, it won’t do you any harm to have another.



The DTaP vaccination is also recommended for pregnant women. Antibodies against pertussis (whooping cough) produced when mothers have the vaccine
can be passed onto newborn babies.

This protects the babies in the first weeks of life when they are most vulnerable
to the disease, until they receive the first dose of the 6-in-1 vaccine.

Is there anyone who shouldn’t have the vaccine?
Your child should not have the vaccine if he or she:


has a high temperature (fever) on the day of the vaccination appointment. You can rearrange the appointment when
your child is well. But your child can have the vaccine if he or she has a minor illness,
such as a cold, without a fever



is allergic to any of the ingredients of the vaccine



has had an allergic reaction to any ingredients of the vaccine before. You should
tell the medical staff about any allergies your child has before they have the vaccination.



Is it safe?
The vaccine has been well tested to ensure its safety. It’s also safe to give alongside
other vaccines, such as the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine.

As with many vaccines, DTaP can cause side effects in some children. These side effects
are usually mild and don’t last long. The most common ones are:



pain, redness, and swelling where the injection was given (called the injection site)


irritability and restlessness


reduced appetite


increased crying, and


fever.


Less common side effects include:


diarrhoea


nausea (feeling sick), and


swollen or aching joints.


Rare side effects include:


a rash at the injection site, and


swollen glands.


Extremely rarely, a child will have a severe allergic reaction to the vaccine. But
the medical staff giving the vaccine will have been trained in how to treat this.

If your child has a fever after having the vaccine, liquid paracetamol can help. But
always be careful not to give more than the recommended dose.

If your child’s fever doesn’t get better after a second dose of liquid paracetamol,
call your doctor.

How is the vaccination given?
As with many vaccines, DTaP is given as an injection into the upper arm.
How well does the vaccine work?
The DTaP vaccine works extremely well. It offers almost total protection for children
who are vaccinated.

Pertussis infection still sometimes happens despite vaccination programmes, but diphtheria,
tetanus, and polio are now almost unheard of in developed countries, and polio has
disappeared from all but a few countries."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1555317967074/Diverticular%20disease,Diverticular disease,"Diverticular disease Last published: Jul 14, 2020
Diverticular disease is a common condition that can lead to painful cramps in your
abdomen. Eating more fibre can sometimes help. There are also treatments that can
improve your symptoms.

What happens?
Lots of people have small pouches of tissue that bulge outwards from their gut wall.
Doctors call these pouches diverticula. If you get symptoms because of these pouches, your doctor may say you have diverticular disease.

If these pouches become inflamed or infected, this is called diverticulitis. Sometimes diverticulitis can lead to more serious problems, such as a hole in your
bowel or a blockage that stops you passing stools.

Diverticula are a bit like an inner tube that pokes through weak places in a tyre.
You can have just one of these pouches. But most people with diverticular disease
have more than one. Some people have hundreds.

Although you can sometimes get these pouches in other places, such as your stomach,
here we look only at diverticula in the last part of your large bowel (your colon).
You may hear this called colonic diverticular disease.

No one knows exactly why people get diverticula. But you may be more likely to get
them if you don't eat enough fibre. Fibre is the part of fruits, vegetables, and grains
that your body can't digest.

What are the symptoms?
Most people with diverticula don't know they have these pouches, as they don't usually
cause problems. Many people only find out they have diverticula when they're having
tests for other conditions that affect their bowel.

When diverticula do cause symptoms, the most common problems are painful cramps in
the lower part of the abdomen, usually on the left side.

The pain may come and go, or it may be constant. It often starts after you've had
a meal and gets better when you pass wind or a stool. Other symptoms include:



bloating


constipation or diarrhoea


blood in your stool. The bleeding may be heavy. If you see blood in your stool you
should see your doctor straight away, as this can also be a sign of a more serious
condition.



If one or more of these pouches become inflamed or infected (called diverticulitis), you may get other symptoms, such as:



severe and constant pain in your lower abdomen, probably on your left side


a high temperature (fever)


nausea and vomiting.


The symptoms of diverticular disease and diverticulitis can resemble the symptoms
of many other conditions. Your doctor will examine you and may test your blood for
signs of inflammation and infection.

Depending on your symptoms, you may have other tests as well, such as a CT scan (a
type of X-ray) or a colonoscopy. During a colonoscopy, doctors use a thin, flexible
tube with a light and camera at the end to look at the inside of your colon.

What treatments work?
If your diverticula aren't causing problems
If you find out you have diverticula during tests for another condition and you don't
have any symptoms, then you don't need any treatment. Your doctor may simply suggest
that you eat plenty of high-fibre food, such as fruits and vegetables.

If your diverticula are causing mild symptoms
If your diverticula are causing mild symptoms, such as some cramping, your doctor
will probably recommend:



adding more fibre to your diet. This could involve eating more high-fibre foods and
possibly taking a fibre supplement. You should also drink plenty of fluids.



taking a course of antibiotics - if your doctor thinks you may have an infection.


If you have diverticulitis
If your diverticula are inflamed or infected, your doctor will recommend:


taking antibiotics. You will probably take antibiotic tablets for a few days. If you
don't improve, you will probably need treatment in hospital with antibiotics through
a drip (an intravenous infusion or IV).



taking painkillers to cope with any discomfort. These may be over-the-counter pain
medicines, such as paracetamol, or stronger medicines that require a prescription.



following a 'low residue diet' until your symptoms improve. This means eating foods
that are easily digested and absorbed, leaving little to pass out of your body in
stools. Examples include white bread, white rice, vegetable and fruit juice without
pulp, and dairy products. These are all low-fibre foods.



If you have complications from diverticulitis
Diverticulitis can sometimes lead to other problems (complications), such as


heavy bleeding


a sac of infected pus (an abscess) forming in the bowel


a blockage in the bowel, or


an abnormal opening (called a fistula) forming between the bowel and another organ
(such as the bladder).



These complications may require surgery to remove the affected part of bowel. However,
sometimes other treatments can help. For example, a small abscess can sometimes be
treated with antibiotics and a larger abscess can be drained.

What will happen to me?
Your symptoms may be mild and you may have long periods when you don’t have any problems.
Or, your condition may be more severe, with symptoms almost constantly.

If you have had diverticulitis and recovered without having surgery, you have about
a 1 in 3 chance of having another attack within five years. Second attacks are usually
more serious than first attacks and are harder to treat.

If you get repeated attacks, your doctor may suggest you have surgery to remove the
affected part of your bowel. This will help prevent more attacks."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1578643241419/Diarrhoea%20in%20children,Diarrhoea in children,"Diarrhoea in children Last published: Aug 30, 2022
If your child has diarrhoea, he or she has loose, runny stools (poo). Most children
recover completely in about a week. But there is a danger that they could lose too
much fluid (become dehydrated). It’s important to prevent this and to treat it quickly
if it happens.

What happens?
Diarrhoea is usually caused by a virus, most often one called rotavirus. Rotavirus
is usually passed on through infected stool (poo).

A vaccine that protects against the rotavirus is available. It protects your child
against rotavirus, but this does not mean that he or she will never get diarrhoea.
This is because other germs can cause diarrhoea, too.

Infections can spread easily, especially among young children in nursery. Most children
get diarrhoea at least once before the age of 5. But you can do a lot to stop the
infection spreading.

Make sure everyone in the family washes their hands properly after using the toilet
or changing a baby's nappy, and before preparing food or eating. Dispose of nappies
properly. Keep your children away from anyone who has diarrhoea or vomiting.

What are the symptoms?
If your child has diarrhoea they have runny poo that comes more often than normal.
They might also be sick (vomit), get belly pain, a high temperature (fever), and lose
their appetite.

Most children recover completely from diarrhoea in a few days, without treatment.
But there is a chance they could become dehydrated. If this happens you should take
them to a doctor straight away.

Signs of dehydration include:


being thirsty


passing urine less often than normal (a baby's nappy might be dry)


being restless or irritable, and


having dry eyes or mouth.


If your child's eyes look sunken, and if they are listless or drowsy, they could already
be severely dehydrated.

In a baby, the fontanelle (the soft spot on the back of a baby's head) might be sunken.
Severe dehydration is life threatening. If your child has any signs of severe dehydration
you should take them to the hospital’s accident and emergency department immediately.

If your child has a high fever (more than 39°C) or blood in their stools, their infection
might be caused by bacteria rather than a virus. Take them to see a doctor. Sometimes
these infections need to be treated with antibiotics.

What treatments work?
Diarrhoea in children is usually caused by a virus (such as rotavirus). Most children
will fight off the virus without treatment. Antibiotics work only for bacteria infections
(like Salmonella). The main danger with diarrhoea is that children can lose too much fluid and become
dehydrated. There are treatments that can stop this happening.

Doctors don't recommend using medicines such as loperamide (brand name Imodium) to
stop diarrhoea in young children.

Things you can do yourself
The most important thing when your child has diarrhoea is to replace the fluid they
are losing. You should see your doctor for advice about how best to do this. This
is especially important if your child is being sick or has difficulty keeping down
fluids.

If you are breastfeeding your doctor will probably recommend that you continue breastfeeding.
You might need to feed your baby more often or make the feeds longer. If your baby
is bottle-fed he or she will probably continue with their usual formula milk.

Older children will probably be able to eat normal food if they are hungry and not
being sick, but check with your doctor which foods are suitable.

Rehydration
Rehydration drinks (also called oral rehydration solutions) help the body replace
fluids and salts. They don’t stop diarrhoea but they can prevent your child from getting
dehydrated. Your doctor might suggest rehydration drinks for your baby or child and
explain the best way to give these.

You might need to help your child drink slowly with small sips. Avoid sugary drinks
such as fruit juice.

Sometimes children can't keep drinks down, won’t drink them, or need fluids very quickly.
Doctors might then need to give them rehydration solutions through a drip into their
arm or a tube into their stomach.

Other treatments
Some babies who have had diarrhoea for a long time might benefit from lactose-free
formula milk while they recover. Ask your doctor about whether you should try a lactose-free
formula for your baby.

What will happen?
Most children who have diarrhoea get better in about a week. They can usually be treated
at home. But take your child to the doctor if you are at all worried, if they do not
get better or are getting worse, or if they have a lot of diarrhoea or vomiting.

If your child starts to get dehydrated he or she might have to go to hospital for
rehydration treatment, and to be kept a close eye on for a few days. Most children
make a good recovery if they get treatment quickly."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1550587151018/Diarrhoea%20in%20adults,Diarrhoea in adults,"Diarrhoea in adults Last published: Sep 17, 2020
Diarrhoea often clears up on its own after a few days. But if you feel very ill, you
may need to see a doctor.

This information looks at diarrhoea in adults. Some of the treatments we talk about
aren't recommended for children.

What is diarrhoea?
If you have diarrhoea you have loose, watery stools or you need to go to the toilet
a lot more often than normal.

This information looks at diarrhoea that's caused by an infection with a virus or
bacteria. You can pick these up from contaminated food or drink.

You can also catch an infection that can cause diarrhoea from another person who has
it.This happens when you touch something that's contaminated with traces of their
stool (for example, the person's hand) and then put your hand to your mouth (for example,
when you eat).

People often get diarrhoea when they're travelling in other countries (called travellers'
diarrhoea). It's a good idea to pack diarrhoea medicine whenever you go on holiday.

What are the symptoms?
As well as watery stools, you may also get vomiting or stomach cramps. Because you
lose water in your stools, having diarrhoea means your body may lose too much fluid
(you get dehydrated). This makes you feel thirsty, and you might have dark-coloured
urine, or feel sleepy.

If your diarrhoea doesn't clear up in a few days you should see a doctor. You should
also see a doctor if:



you have a high temperature (fever)


there's blood in your stools


you've been travelling abroad


you've just come out of hospital


you work as a carer, or


you work in a job where you handle food.


If you're too ill to eat or drink, see a doctor as soon as you can.
What treatments work?
Prevention
You can help prevent diarrhoea by washing your hands after using the toilet, before
preparing food, and before eating.

There are other precautions you can take when travelling abroad, especially in countries
where tap water might not be safe to drink.

When travelling in these countries you should only drink water that is bottled and
properly sealed. Avoid eating or drinking:



ice and tap water


salads, previously peeled fruits, and raw foods


unpackaged condiments and sauces


food from street vendors and buffets.


Taking care of yourself
Some people prefer to eat simple foods, like bread, if they have diarrhoea. But the
most important thing is to have plenty to drink.

It's best to avoid drinks that contain a lot of sugar as they can make diarrhoea worse.
You should also avoid drinks that contain caffeine.

You can also go to a pharmacy and buy rehydration salts that you mix with water. They are designed to replace fluids and mineral salts your
body may have lost. But, for people with mild dehydration, it's not clear whether
they're better for rehydration than water or soft drinks.

Medicines
There are two main types of medicine that can help if you have diarrhoea: antibiotics
to fight bacterial infection, and drugs that slow down your bowel movements.

Antibiotics are drugs that kill bacteria. But not all diarrhoea is caused by bacteria, so antibiotics
aren't the right treatment for everyone. Your doctor may do tests to see what kind
of diarrhoea you have.

Antibiotics also have side effects. Some of these side effects may be similar to the
symptoms you want treated, such as nausea, a stomach ache, or diarrhoea. But they
aren't usually serious enough for people to stop taking their antibiotics.

Some medicines help to deal with diarrhoea by slowing down your bowel movements. You
can buy some of these from a pharmacy.

But they're not recommended for severe diarrhoea, as they can mask your symptoms. This
means that, because they reduce your diarrhoea, you seem more recovered than you are.

These medicines are most useful in people whose symptoms are not severe, or who have
begun to recover and who possibly need to travel.

Some of these medicines can cause side effects, including diziness and constipation.
You shouldn't take these medicines if you have a fever or if there's blood or mucus
in your stools. If you have these symptoms, see a doctor.

What will happen to me?
Diarrhoea isn't usually serious. Most people get better on their own without any problems.
The main risk is losing too much water (getting dehydrated). So it's important to
drink plenty of fluids, especially if you're an older person. Drinking often, in small
sips, may be the best way to drink with an upset stomach. Occasionally, people who
get very dehydrated need to go to hospital."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1486656113353/Diabetic%20ketoacidosis,Diabetic ketoacidosis,"Diabetic ketoacidosis Last published: Jul 06, 2020
Diabetic ketoacidosis is a complication that can happen to people who have diabetes.
It is a medical emergency that needs immediate treatment. Most people recover completely
after treatment. But it is serious and can be fatal.

What is diabetic ketoacidosis?
Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) usually affects people with type 1 diabetes who are taking
insulin to treat the condition. Insulin is a hormone that your body needs to help
process the sugar in your blood so that you can use it for fuel.

People who have type 1 diabetes don’t produce insulin in their bodies, so they take
it as injections.

DKA can also happen to people who have type 2 diabetes, usually because of an infection
or serious heart problems.

When insulin levels are so low that your body can’t process your blood sugar, you
start to break down your body fat to use as fuel. By-products of this fat-burning
process, called ketones, then start to build up in your body. If this build-up of
ketones gets too high and is not treated it can be damaging and even fatal. This is
called diabetic ketoacidosis.

If you have diabetes you will know that there are several complications that can happen
if your blood sugar gets too high or too low, or if you are not taking the right dose
or type of medication. DKA is probably the most serious of these complications.

The most common cause of DKA is when someone with type 1 diabetes doesn’t take enough
insulin. For example, this could happen if:



your dose is too low


you become ill and stop taking your insulin as usual


your body needs more insulin than usual because you have had an infection.


If you are unsure about how much insulin to take if you are ill, talk to your doctor
or your diabetic nurse or practitioner. If you are very unwell or you have an infection,
seek emergency medical help. It’s a good idea to have a plan in place about what to
do about insulin if you get an infection or another illness.

Some other health conditions, such as heart attacks and strokes, can also make DKA
more likely, as can some medications. These include:



anti-inflammatory drugs called corticosteroids


some drugs used to treat anxiety and other mental-health problems.


DKA can also happen as the first sign of diabetes in people who didn’t know they had
the disease.

What are the symptoms?
If you take insulin to treat diabetes, or if you have a child who takes insulin for
diabetes, you should be aware of the symptoms of DKA. If you think that you or your
child might be developing DKA seek medical attention straight away.

The symptoms of DKA usually develop quickly over a matter of hours. The most common
symptoms are:



needing to pass urine a lot more than usual


being extremely thirsty and needing to drink a lot of fluids (because you are passing
so much urine and becoming dehydrated)



being very hungry.


But you might have other symptoms, such as:


feeling weak


nausea or vomiting


tummy pain


a fruity breath odour


feeling confused.


If your symptoms come on over several days you might notice some sudden weight loss.


If you use a kit to test your own blood sugar or ketone levels, you might find that
these are higher than usual. But this is not always the case.

The doctor will test your blood and urine to check levels of sugar, ketones, and other
substances. He or she will also ask you about any medications you might be taking,
including diabetes medications.

Your doctor might also suggest some other tests, such as tests to check your heartbeat,
or a chest x-ray.

What treatments work?
DKA is a medical emergency. Most people need to be treated in hospital. If your symptoms
are severe you might need to be treated in an intensive care unit (ICU) to begin with.
Treatment in an ICU allows for more detailed monitoring and testing.

But wherever you are treated, your treatment will come in two basic steps.
Step one: fluids
The first treatment you will need is fluids to treat the dehydration that goes with
DKA. You will be given fluids by an intravenous (IV) drip.

If your blood tests show that you are low in some important minerals, such as potassium,
you might also be given minerals in your IV.

Step two: insulin
You will need treatment with insulin. This will reduce your blood sugar level to where
it needs to be.

Insulin treatment for DKA is given gradually in small doses so that your blood sugar
comes down slowly. This is to prevent any sudden changes that might cause an unwanted
reaction, and to help your body adjust comfortably to the fall in blood sugar.

If your symptoms are mild or moderate you will probably be given insulin in small
doses as injections, every hour or two. If your symptoms are more severe you will
probably be given low-dose insulin by IV.

What will happen?
Most people recover completely from DKA. But complications can happen. These are usually
short term, such as blood sugar becoming too low, and they can be corrected with the
right treatment.

More serious complications, such as swelling in the brain, can sometimes happen. And
some people die from DKA.

After treatment you will need to stay in hospital for monitoring for a while. But
you should be able to leave hospital when you feel well enough to eat and drink normally.
A doctor or diabetes nurse should talk with you before you go home, to advise you
about what causes DKA and how to prevent it happening again."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1550371841477/Diabetes%3A%20what%20is%20it%3F,Diabetes: what is it?,"Diabetes: what is it? Last published: Aug 06, 2021
Diabetes is a long-term condition. It can lead to serious health problems. But making
changes to your lifestyle and taking medicines can help you live a long and healthy
life.
What happens in diabetes?
If you have diabetes you have too much glucose in your blood. Glucose is a kind of
sugar that your body uses for energy. But if it builds up in your blood it can make
you ill. Doctors call this hyperglycaemia.

There are two main types of diabetes: type 1 and type 2. Type 1 diabetes usually starts
suddenly, when you're a child or teenager. But it can start later. Type 2 diabetes
comes on gradually, usually when you're 40 or over.

This information is for adults with type 2 diabetes. More than 90 in 100 people with diabetes have type 2.

Ask your doctor: What type of diabetes do I have?
Glucose and your body
You always need to have some glucose in your blood. It comes from food and it gives
your body energy.

Normally, a chemical called insulin helps keep the levels of glucose in your blood
steady. Insulin is made in your body. But if you have type 2 diabetes, either your
body is not making enough insulin, or the insulin your body makes is not working properly.

The level of glucose in your blood goes up and down throughout the day. It's higher
when you've just eaten and lower first thing in the morning, or after you've been
exercising.

Doctors measure your glucose levels in millimoles per litre of blood (mmol/L for short). Your 'fasting' blood glucose (the amount of glucose in your blood when you haven't
eaten or drunk anything but water overnight) should be less than 7 mmol/L.

Ask your doctor: What is my blood glucose level? What should it be ideally?
Who gets diabetes?
Type 2 diabetes is fairly common. For example, more than 3 million people in the UK
have diabetes. That's about 5 in every 100 people.

Some people are more likely to get it than others. Things that make you more likely
to get type 2 diabetes include:



having a relative with type 2 diabetes


being overweight or obese (very overweight)


not exercising enough


coming from South Asian, African, African-Caribbean, or Middle Eastern families (we
don't know why this is)



(for women) having had a type of diabetes while pregnant (called gestational diabetes)
increases your chance of getting diabetes later in life



having problems with your heart or blood vessels (cardiovascular disease) or having
too much harmful fat in your blood.



But we don't know why some people get diabetes. For example, being overweight and
not exercising enough increase people's chances of getting diabetes. But not everyone
who gets diabetes is overweight or doesn't exercise. Even some athletes get diabetes.

Ask your doctor: Why do I have diabetes?
What are the symptoms of diabetes?
Not everyone with type 2 diabetes gets symptoms, and most people find out they have
it through screening (testing). But these are some possible symptoms.



Needing to pass urine more often: your body tries to get rid of the extra glucose
in your blood by flushing it out in your urine.



Feeling very thirsty: you may feel thirsty more often. This is partly because you
pass urine more.



Feeling very hungry or tired: if you have diabetes, your body can't use the glucose
in your blood properly. So your cells don't get the energy they need. This makes you
hungry and tired.



These symptoms should go away if your treatment is working properly. But if it's not
diagnosed and treated properly, type 2 diabetes gets worse. You might get:



blurred vision


an infection called candidiasis. You might know this as thrush. You might get it in
your mouth or in the folds of your skin. If you're a woman you might get it in your
vagina



wounds or sores that don't heal well.


There are some symptoms you need to watch out for, because they mean your blood glucose
may have got very high. These include feeling light-headed, dizzy, sick, or confused.
Or you might lose consciousness. If you get these symptoms you need medical help straight
away.

Ask your doctor: What symptoms should I look out for that might mean my diabetes is
getting worse or is not being well controlled?

How do doctors diagnose diabetes?
Your doctor will give you a blood test to find out how much glucose is in your blood.
The usual test for diabetes measures glucose levels first thing in the morning, before
you eat.

The result is called your fasting plasma glucose level. If it is more than 7 you could have diabetes. You will need to have a second test
to make sure.

You might also have a type of blood test called an HbA1c test (sometimes called an A1c test). This test can give your doctor an idea of what your
average blood glucose has been for the past few months.

If you've been told you have diabetes your doctor will probably want to do other tests
on your blood and urine. These tests are to find out how well your thyroid gland,
liver, and kidneys are working. You will also have a test to see if your cholesterol
is high.

After you've been diagnosed with diabetes you should have a thorough check-up at least
once a year with a doctor experienced in treating diabetes. You might have follow-up
tests as often as every 3 to 6 months.

Ask your doctor: How often do I need follow-up tests?
What will happen to me?
If you have diabetes you should be able to lead a normal life. But you will probably
need to:



take medicines regularly. You may have heard that people with diabetes can be treated
with insulin. This is usually only used for people with type 1 diabetes. But some
people with type 2 diabetes take it, too



watch what you eat


exercise regularly


check your blood glucose level throughout the day. But this is usually only needed
for people who take insulin.



Apart from these changes, you should be able to take part in all your normal activities.
You may need to tell the authorities where you live if you have a health problem that
could affect your driving. For example, in the UK, you'll need to tell the Driver
and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) about your diabetes. Check with your doctor.

If you've had diabetes for a long time, you may have a greater chance of a heart attack,
a stroke, or problems with your circulation. You may also get problems with your eyes,
kidneys, and feet. These problems are called complications.

Not everyone with diabetes gets complications. If you carefully control your blood
glucose level you are more likely to avoid some of the complications of diabetes.

But you might also need to take medicines to control your blood pressure and cholesterol.
Having regular health checks with your doctor can help you to avoid complications.

Ask your doctor: Do I have any complications from my diabetes? If not, how can I best
avoid getting problems in future?

If you have diabetes, making changes to your lifestyle, having regular check-ups,
and following your doctor's treatment plan can help you stay healthy.
What health problems might I get?
If you have diabetes you have too much glucose in your blood. Glucose is a kind of
sugar that your body uses for energy. But if it builds up in your blood it can cause
problems. You might get damage in the blood vessels of your feet, kidneys, and eyes.
You also have more of a chance of having a heart attack or stroke.

There are many things you can do to reduce your chance of having these health problems.
We've listed them below. Doing these things has many benefits for your health. They
help to:



keep the levels of glucose in your blood as close to normal as possible


control your blood pressure, and


keep your cholesterol (a fatty substance in the blood) at a healthy level.


Your doctor or nurse can help you work out the levels of blood glucose, blood pressure,
and cholesterol that you should aim for.

Eating a healthy diet
There are healthy eating guidelines for people with type 2 diabetes. But doctors are
keen to stress that many people benefit from food plans that are tailored to what's
best for them. So your doctor might refer you to a dietitian who will help you find
a food plan that suits you.

In general, though, doctors recommend that people with type 2 diabetes eat a balanced,
low-fat diet with plenty of fibre. You don't need to buy special diabetic foods.

Things to avoid include:


too many sugary foods and drinks


starchy, carbohydrate-rich foods such as white bread and pasta. Avoid these, or choose
the wholemeal options instead, and



saturated fats.


Healthier foods for people with type 2 diabetes include wholegrains, beans and pulses,
oily fish, fruit and vegetables, and low-fat dairy products.

The aim is to lose weight, if you are overweight, and to stop your blood pressure
from getting too high. A healthy diet can also help keep your blood glucose and cholesterol
under control.

Stopping smoking
Smoking increases your chances of having a heart attack or a stroke. It also makes
other circulation problems worse.

If you have diabetes your chances of a heart attack, a stroke, or other circulation
problems are already higher than for most people. So it makes sense to give up smoking,
to reduce your risk as much as possible.

Stopping smoking isn't easy, but help is available. Getting professional help from
your doctor, a nurse, or a trained counsellor can help you stop smoking. There are
also treatments that can help, including nicotine replacement therapy and medications.

Taking exercise
If you haven't exercised much in the past, making exercise part of your life might
seem hard. But exercise has great benefits. It will help keep down the level of glucose
in your blood. It will also:



help keep your weight down


help keep your blood pressure and cholesterol under control, and


help reduce your chances of having a heart attack or a stroke.


Talk to your doctor about what sort of exercise is best for you. Most doctors advise
people to do some kind of physical activity every day. Broadly speaking there are
two kinds of exercise, and doctors recommend doing a mixture of both.

Aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking or cycling, gets you out of breath and makes your heart and
lungs work harder.

Resistance strength training, such as lifting weights, makes your muscles work harder.

So, for example, you might want to do some aerobic exercise on some days, and some
gentle resistance training on others. Try to find an exercise you enjoy, so it's easier
to keep at it.

Ask your doctor if you need to change your medication when you exercise. Exercise
uses up glucose, so you might need to take less medicine or take it later. If you
are going to exercise for a long time you might need to eat a snack first.

Regular check-ups
When you're first diagnosed with diabetes you'll probably need to see many different
health professionals, to check whether you have any health problems. Once your treatment
is going well you might only need check-ups twice a year. These check-ups are important
to make sure your treatment is working and you're not getting any health problems.

You should have these tests at least once a year:


a blood or urine test to check if your kidneys are working properly


a test of your blood sugar control. This is called an HbA1c test. It shows doctors
how well your treatment is working. For example, in the UK it is recommended that
you have this test at least twice a year. You might need to have this test more often
if your diabetes is not well controlled.



an eye test.


You might also have your cholesterol checked.
During a check-up, your doctor will look at:


your weight, to see if you need to lose some weight to control your diabetes better


your legs and feet: Your doctor will examine your skin and check to see if your circulation
and nerves are working properly. You may need to see a foot doctor if you have any
problems with your feet



your blood pressure


your eyes: You might need to see an eye doctor for this check. The doctor will examine
the backs of your eyes (your retina). Diabetes can damage your retina and affect your
eyesight.



Your doctor may also help you to learn how to check your blood glucose at home, especially
if you need to take insulin.

Taking medicines
Some people control their diabetes with just diet and exercise. But most people with
diabetes need to take medicines. There are different types.



Medicines to control your blood glucose. Keeping your blood sugar as close to normal
as possible may help you avoid damage to your eyes, kidneys, and feet.



Medicines to keep your blood pressure and cholesterol levels healthy. These medicines
reduce the chance of a heart attack or a stroke. You might also need to take a low
dose of aspirin or a similar medicine, to thin your blood.



You'll probably need to take more than one type of medicine. It can be hard to keep
track of all the medicines you are taking. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for help.
You might want to try a pill organiser.

It's important to take all your medicines as prescribed by your doctor. This gives
you the best chance of staying healthy.

Adjusting your medication
It's likely that your doctor will adjust your medications from time to time. This
is a good sign. It means that your doctor is paying close attention to your condition,
and changing your medication based on what your body needs at a particular time. It
doesn't mean that you are doing anything wrong.

Side effects of medications
Some medicines have side effects. If you are having problems with your medicines,
don't just stop taking them. Talk to your doctor first. You don't have to put up with
side effects. You may need to switch to a different type of medicine, or to a different
dose.

Some people with type 2 diabetes need regular insulin injections to control their
blood glucose. But you are unlikely to need insulin straight away, and you might never
need it.

If your doctor thinks you would benefit from insulin, you'll usually have plenty of
time to discuss it before you start injections, and you'll learn all about insulin
and how to use it."

If you have diabetes, closely following your doctor's treatment recommendations can
help you live a long and healthy life. Although not everyone with diabetes needs medicine,
most people do, and you might need to take several types.

Treatments for diabetes
If you have diabetes you have too much glucose in your blood. Glucose is a kind of
sugar that your body uses for energy. Normally, a chemical called insulin helps keep
the levels of glucose in your blood steady. Insulin is made in your body.

But if you have type 2 diabetes your body is not making enough insulin, or the insulin
your body makes is not working properly. So glucose can build up in your blood and
cause problems. Doctors call this hyperglycaemia.

Having type 2 diabetes increases your chances of having two main types of health problem:


problems with the larger blood vessels, leading to heart attacks and strokes (called
macrovascular complications)



problems with the smaller blood vessels in the eyes, kidneys, and feet (called microvascular
complications).



Many people with diabetes need treatment with medicines to prevent these problems.
This includes medicines to lower blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol.

As well as taking medications, people with diabetes need to look after themselves
in two key ways, to help keep the heart healthy and control blood sugar. These are:



eating healthily. Your doctor might refer you to a dietitian to help you plan the
best way for you to eat



exercising regularly. Most people with diabetes are overweight and have problems with
their blood vessels that can be helped with regular exercise.



For more information, see our leaflet: Diabetes: what can I do to keep healthy?
Medicines to control your blood sugar
There are several types of medicine that can help keep your blood sugar levels under
control. Some of them help your body release more insulin. Others help your body use
insulin better. Some are tablets and others are injections.

Although doctors set general blood sugar targets for people with diabetes, in practice
your treatment, including your blood sugar target, will be tailored to your individual
needs.

Not everyone needs the same level of treatment. And different medicines suit some
people better than others.

For example, some people take two or three types of tablet, while others might take
a combination of tablets and insulin injections. It all depends what is likely to
help you the most and to give you the fewest problems with side effects.

Tablets to control blood sugar:


Metformin: this is the first medicine that most people with type 2 diabetes are offered
for controlling blood glucose. It can also help reduce your chances of having a heart
attack or stroke.

It doesn’t make you put on weight, unlike many other diabetes medicines. But it can
make you feel sick or get diarrhoea, especially if you take it on an empty stomach.

So your doctor will probably recommend that you build up the dose slowly and take
this medicine with food. You might take metformin on its own or with another type
of diabetes medicine.



DPP-4 inhibitors: these medicines help reduce the amount of a substance called glucagon
in your blood. You might also hear them called gliptins. These drugs are often used
together with metformin.



Sulfonylureas: these medicines help your body release more insulin. They are sometimes
used as a first diabetes medicine. There are different types of sulfonylurea. You
might take a sulfonylurea on its own, or with metformin or injections of medicines
called GLP-1 agonists.

But sulfonylureas can sometimes make your blood sugar too low. The medical name for
this is hypoglycaemia. Some people get an allergic reaction (usually a skin rash)
when they start taking sulfonylureas. You might also gain some weight.

Meglitinide medicines are similar to sulfonylureas and are sometimes used instead.
You take them just before you eat. You might take them as well as metformin. They
can make your blood sugar too low, although this is less likely than with sulfonylureas.
They can cause some weight gain.



Alpha glucosidase inhibitors: these are sometimes used if you can’t take another type
of diabetes medicine. They slow down the speed at which your body breaks down food
to make glucose. But they can cause bloating, wind, and diarrhoea.

They might also cause a small amount of weight loss in some people. You might take
an alpha glucosidase inhibitor on its own or with another type of diabetes medicine.



Sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors: these work by helping the
kidneys to reduce blood sugar.



Glitazones: these medicines are not used as often as some other diabetes medicines.
And they are only used if you are also taking either metformin or a sulfonylurea.

Your doctor will want to monitor you regularly if you take a glitazone as they can
cause serious side effects in some people, including liver damage, heart failure,
and an increased chance of fractures.



Injections to control blood sugar


Insulin: some people with diabetes need to take insulin to keep their blood sugar
under control. Insulin can’t be taken as a tablet. It’s usually taken as an injection.
Not everyone with type 2 diabetes needs to take insulin. But if your diabetes medicine
is not working to keep your blood sugar under control your doctor may suggest you
consider insulin.



Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonists: these are medicines given by injection that
are sometimes used with diabetes tablets like metformin and sulfonylureas. As well
as controlling blood sugar they might also help reduce your chance of having a heart
attack or stroke.

They can have some side effects, such as lowering the level of sugar in your blood
after you eat, and some people lose a little weight.



Medicines to prevent heart attacks and strokes
Having diabetes increases your chances of having a heart attack, stroke, or circulation
problems. So most people with diabetes take medicines to help prevent these problems.
These might include medicines to:



control blood pressure


control cholesterol


prevent blood clots.


Medicines to control your blood pressure
Most people with diabetes need to take medicines for their blood pressure. If your
doctor recommends blood pressure tablets your blood pressure is probably higher than
the usual target range.

These are some of the types you might be prescribed. You might take just one, or a
combination of tablets.



Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors: these medicines help stop your blood
vessels from narrowing too much and your heart from working too hard.

ACE inhibitors can have some side effects. The most common one is a dry cough. Some
people get low blood pressure (which can make you feel dizzy), kidney problems, or
problems with their heart rhythm.



Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs): these drugs work in a similar way to ACE inhibitors.
If you can't take an ACE inhibitor your doctor might prescribe an ARB. They seem to
work about as well. Most people only get mild side effects from ARBs. The most common
side effect is dizziness.



Diuretics: these help your body get rid of excess salt and water. Your doctor might
suggest you take a diuretic as well as other blood pressure drugs. Diuretics can make
you feel thirsty and can raise your blood sugar. They also make you urinate more.



Calcium channel blockers: these medicines keep the blood vessels relaxed and open,
making it easier for blood to flow through them. People usually only take them if
they are already taking another blood pressure medicine.

Possible side effects include headaches, dizziness, swollen ankles, flushing (going
red in the face), an uneven heart beat, and constipation.



Medicines to control your cholesterol
Taking a type of medicine called a statin can help reduce your chance of a heart attack
or stroke. If you have diabetes this can help even if your cholesterol level is not
high to start with.

Statins are the usual treatment for lowering cholesterol.
If your cholesterol is still high after taking statins, or if you can’t take statins,
there are other options. But we don't know if they work as well as statins to reduce
the chance of a stroke or heart attack.

Medicines to stop your blood from clotting
Aspirin makes your blood less sticky so that it’s less likely to form blood clots.
This can help prevent a stroke or heart attack in people who are at high risk of these
problems. Many people with diabetes take a low daily dose of aspirin.

Side effects
Most medicines can cause some side effects for some people. We don't know as much
about the side effects of some of the newer medicines as we do about the ones that
have been around for longer.

The leaflet that comes with your medicine lists the possible side effects. But very
few are likely to affect you. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you get any problems.
You might be able to try different treatments."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1183729637082/Diabetes%20type%202%3A%20should%20I%20take%20insulin%3F,Diabetes type 2: should I take insulin?,"Diabetes type 2: should I take insulin? Last published: Aug 06, 2021
If you take tablets for diabetes and they don’t control your blood sugar well enough,
your doctor might suggest that you start taking insulin. This leaflet tells you what
taking insulin involves and how it can help.

What is insulin?
Insulin is a hormone that your body makes to keep the amount of glucose (sugar) in
your blood steady. If you have type 2 diabetes your body doesn't make enough insulin,
or the insulin it does make doesn't work properly. This means that too much glucose
builds up in your bloodstream. This can make you ill.

The insulin you take for diabetes is made in a laboratory to be as much like natural
human insulin as possible. It works in the same way to keep your blood sugar under
control.

You can't take insulin as a tablet, because the digestive juices in your stomach would
destroy the insulin. It’s usually taken as an injection. You might worry about the
idea of giving yourself an injection.

But there are special devices made for people with diabetes who need to take insulin.
These devices make injecting insulin much easier and the needles are very thin. So
it shouldn’t hurt and you will probably find you soon get used to it.

Some people with diabetes need to use a device called an insulin pump. This is a small
machine about the size of a pack of cards that regularly delivers small amounts of
insulin into the body through a tube that goes into the skin.

Why might I need to take insulin?
Most people with type 2 diabetes start by taking tablets to control their blood sugar.
These tablets encourage the body to make more insulin or to make better use of insulin.
But some people make so little insulin that these tablets are not enough. They need
to take extra insulin to keep their blood sugar under control.

If your blood sugar is too high you might get symptoms of high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia)
such as feeling tired and thirsty a lot. Although not everyone gets symptoms.

If your blood sugar stays too high for a long time it can damage your blood vessels.
You could get serious problems, such as damage to the nerves in your feet, which can
make it hard to walk, or to your eyes, which could damage your eyesight.

Your doctor will measure how well your blood sugar is controlled using a blood test
called the haemoglobin A1c test (also known as HbA1c). This test can show how high
your blood sugar has been over the previous three months.

If this test shows your blood sugar is too high over a long time, even when you are
taking diabetes tablets, your doctor might suggest that you start taking insulin.


How can it help?
Having insulin injections can help bring your blood sugar levels back under control.
You should no longer get symptoms of hyperglycaemia. And if your blood sugar levels
are lower you are less likely to get damaged blood vessels in your eyes, nerves, and
kidneys.

Insulin should lower your haemoglobin A1c level. If you start taking insulin because
your diabetes is not well controlled, your HbA1clevel is likely to be one to two points
lower after four months than if you’d been taking tablets instead. This shows that
your blood sugar is better controlled with insulin.

If you have just started treatment for type 2 diabetes you are unlikely to start with
insulin. Diabetes tablets are likely to work as well as insulin for you to begin with.


Can it be harmful?
If you take insulin injections instead of tablets you are more likely to get low blood
sugar (hypoglycaemia) and to put on some weight.

The biggest problem with taking insulin is getting a good balance between your insulin
dose and your eating and activity. If you take too much insulin you could get low
blood sugar (hypoglycaemia).

But if you don't take enough insulin your blood sugar can go too high. This is called
hyperglycaemia. People who take insulin need to check their blood sugar level regularly
to keep it in their target range.

Before you start taking insulin your doctor or nurse will explain how to recognise
the signs of very low blood sugar and what to do about it. Some people call having
very low blood sugar having a hypo (from the word 'hypoglycaemia').

If you have a hypo you might feel drowsy, dizzy, or confused. You might even lose
consciousness. This can be dangerous. But if you learn to recognise the warning signs,
taking some glucose pills or having a sugary drink can keep you from having a bad
hypo.

It's useful if family members or close friends know what to do if you have a hypo
or lose consciousness.

This might include knowing how to use a glucagon kit in an emergency. Glucagon is
a hormone that helps to raise blood sugar levels. If you have a severe hypo or if
you lose consciousness a glucagon injection can help restore your blood sugar to a
safer level.

It's a good idea if family members and close friends know how to use the kit, in case
you can't give yourself the injection.

Many people who take insulin wear an insulin bracelet or badge. These items can be
marked with personal information that can help medical personnel in an emergency.

How and when do I take insulin?
The type of insulin you take will depend on how your body responds to insulin and
how you want to use it. Your doctor or diabetes nurse will help you to work out which
type of insulin is best for you, and to work out a dosing schedule that suits you.


It might take some time to get your dosing schedule to fit well with how you live.
Different people need different dosing schedules. The amount of insulin you need changes
according to how much you eat and how much exercise you take.

The first drug many people with type 2 diabetes will be prescribed is metformin. Many
people who take insulin will keep taking metformin. Some people find that they can
manage their blood sugar best by having an injection of long-acting insulin at night.
If that doesn't work they might also have injections before meals.

You will have to adjust your dose of insulin if you plan to eat, or to exercise, more
or less than usual. But if you have trouble mixing insulin pre-mixed versions are
available.

Changes in your body can affect how much insulin you need: for example, if you have
an infection, or if you're stressed, or your body is having hormone changes from puberty.

If you become pregnant your doctor will want to monitor your insulin needs closely.
You will need to be extra careful during these times. You might need to see your doctor
or diabetes nurse if you find it hard to control your blood sugar levels.

You can inject insulin into several different places on your body, but here are a
few rules to remember:



Insulin injected in your abdomen works fastest


Insulin injected into your thigh works more slowly


Insulin injected into your arm works at medium speed.


It's a good idea to vary where you inject. This doesn't necessarily mean that you
inject in different areas of the body, just that you avoid injecting in the same spot
all the time.

Testing your blood glucose
If you take insulin you need to test your blood sugar regularly to make sure it isn’t
getting too high or too low. There are kits to help you do this.

You take some of your blood, usually one drop from your finger or your forearm. Most
people use a testing device for this. When you press the button the needle goes into
your finger to give you the right amount of blood.

When you have a drop of blood on your finger you touch the drop to a test strip on
a meter. The meter analyses your blood and tells you how much sugar is in it. The
number usually shows on a little screen on the meter. Sometimes you might also use
a continuous glucose monitoring device.

Your doctor will help you decide how often to test your blood. Some people need just
one test a day. Others need to do it before they take their insulin (three or four
times a day).

Based on your test results you might need to adjust your insulin dose or your activities.
You will get used to this over time. But if you're not sure what to do, ask your diabetes
nurse or your doctor for advice.

Driving and insulin
The law about insulin and driving varies from country to country. For example, in
the UK and Australia you need to let the local driving licence authority know if you
are using insulin. In the UK it's the DVLA. You need to be careful about your blood
sugar level when you're driving. If your blood sugar drops too low when you're at
the wheel you could have a hypo and black out.

Check your blood sugar level just before you get into the car. Always have some sugary
drinks or sweets in the car. If you feel you're going into a hypo you can stop and
have a drink or some sweets to boost your blood sugar. It's a good idea to check your
blood again before driving.

You might also want to make sure you're wearing an insulin bracelet or badge when
driving, and to have a glucagon kit handy.

What are the alternatives?
Some people find that taking tablets and watching their diet is enough to keep their
blood sugar under control. But if your blood sugar is not well controlled with tablets
you risk getting serious health problems from diabetes.

If your doctor thinks you might benefit from taking insulin you will usually have
plenty of time to discuss this, think about it, and make a decision with your doctor.

Your doctor will also make sure that you know how to inject yourself and how to test
your blood sugar. He or she should give you a lot of help and support to adjust to
taking insulin.

It's also important to remember that, whether you take insulin or not, you still need
to take measures to control other problems linked with diabetes, such as high cholesterol
and high blood pressure."

Type 1 diabetes is a long-term condition that usually starts in childhood or young
adulthood, but it can also occur later in life. Taking insulin, eating healthily,
and staying active can help you, or your child, live a long and healthy life with
type 1 diabetes.

You can use our information to talk with your doctor and decide which treatments are
right for you or your child.

What is it?
If you have diabetes, you have too much glucose in your blood. Glucose is a kind of sugar that your body uses for energy. But if
too much of it builds up in your blood it can make you ill.

There are two main types of diabetes: type 1 and type 2. This information is for adults
with type 1 diabetes and parents of children with this condition. Type 1 diabetes
usually starts in childhood, adolescence, or early adulthood, but it may also start
later in adult life.

Everyone needs a hormone called insulin to keep their blood glucose at a healthy level. But when you have type 1 diabetes,
your body stops making insulin or makes very little of it.

This kind of diabetes used to be called insulin-dependent diabetes, because it can
be controlled by taking insulin.

Usually, type 1 diabetes is what's called an autoimmune disease. This means that the cells in your immune system, which normally fight infection,
attack some of your own cells by mistake. In type 1 diabetes, the immune system attacks
the cells that make insulin.

Doctors don't know why this happens. It may be triggered by viruses, or by your genes,
or by a combination of things. Some people get type 1 diabetes without having an autoimmune
problem, but this isn't common.

What treatments are available?
There isn't a cure for type 1 diabetes. But treatment can help you, or your child,
stay healthy. The main treatment is taking insulin, probably several times a day.

People with type 1 diabetes take insulin because it helps to keep their blood glucose level (the amount of glucose in their blood) as close to normal as possible. Blood glucose
that's too high or too low can cause serious problems.

If you have type 1 diabetes it's also important to:


check your blood glucose regularly



eat a  healthy diet, and



exercise regularly.



If your child has type 1 diabetes, staff members at their school should be trained to help them manage their diabetes, including their insulin. Your
child should usually be able to do all the same activities as other children their
age.

Checking your blood glucose level
As well as taking insulin, you will need to check your blood glucose level several times a day.

This can be a bit complicated and can take time to get used to. But the staff treating
you will help you to get used to how it works.

They should also explain things like why a 'normal' level of blood glucose can vary
at different times of the day. For example, 'normal' might be quite low first thing
in the morning, when you haven't eaten for 12 hours or so, or when you're exercising
and using a lot of energy.

Your doctor should also help you to work out a testing routine that works with your
own (or your child's) personal needs and situation.

For example, most people need to keep their blood glucose as close to normal as possible,
all the time. But this can be hard to do in people who find the constant tests distressing,
such as very young children, or older people. If issues like these affect you, you and
your doctor can work out an approach that's a bit more relaxed.

Ways of checking blood glucose
For many years, people with diabetes have checked their blood glucose with a finger-prick
test. This involves drawing a tiny drop of blood and for testing. Many people still
use this method.

But in recent years new testing methods have become available. These are often useful for
people who find constant finger-rick testing distressing such as young children, or
for people who have trouble remembering to do the testing.

One of these methods is called Continuous Glucose Monitoring or CGM. To use this method you need special equipment, which consists of:



a  sensor that attaches to your abdomen (tummy). It measures the amount of glucose that's just
under your skin, and



a transmitter attached to the sensor. This sends your blood glucose information to a receiver or
to your smartphone.

You can get a CGM device that works with an insulin pump, if you use one, or one that
works by itself. As the name suggests, this system sends continuous readings to your
receiver or phone, so that you always know your blood glucose level.

A similar method is called Flash monitoring. With the Flash system, the sensor attaches to your arm instead of your tummy. It
sends information to your receiver in the same way as CGM, but only when you scan
the sensor.

The Flash system is much cheaper than the CGM system. But, depending on where you
live, you might be able to get one of these systems for free.

For example, in the UK, many people with type 1 diabetes, including pregnant women
and most children, should be able to get free CGM or Flash systems. You can talk to
your doctor about whether you can get this type of equipment without having to pay.



Insulin
Insulin is a hormone that helps move glucose from your blood into your body's cells.
Your cells then use the glucose as energy. Insulin keeps the level of glucose in your
blood steady.

The insulin used for diabetes is made in a laboratory. It is designed to be as much
like natural human insulin as possible. It works in the same way to keep blood glucose
under control.

There are different types of insulin. They vary in:


how quickly they work


when they peak, and


how long they last.


For example, you might hear your doctor use terms like basal insulin and bolus insulin.



Basal insulin is the normal scheduled dose that you take several times a day, while



bolus insulin is a dose that you take at mealtimes, to help deal with the glucose that
enters your blood when you eat.



Your doctor will help you work out which are best for you or your child, and decide
on a dosing schedule.

Ways to take insulin
You can't take insulin as tablets, because the digestive juices in your stomach would
destroy the insulin. Most people take it as injections, several times a day.

You might not like the idea of giving yourself or your child injections. But there
are special devices made for people with diabetes that make giving injections much
easier. The needles in these devices are very thin and you will probably find you
soon get used to them.

Another way to take insulin is with an insulin pump. This is a device that gives the body a constant supply of insulin. The pump is about
the same size and shape as a pack of cards.

Inside the pump is a store of insulin. It is pumped out through a long tube and into
the body through a special kind of needle that stays in the skin. However, you can
disconnect it for short periods (for example, while showering or bathing, going swimming,
or getting dressed).

Dosing schedule
It might take some time to work out a dosing schedule that fits well with how you
or your child lives. The amount of insulin people with type 1 diabetes need changes
according to what they eat and drink, and how much exercise they take.

It can also change for other reasons, including if:


they have an infection


they're stressed, or


their body is having hormone changes from puberty or pregnancy.


You will need to be extra careful during these times.
If you are a woman and would like to become pregnant, talk to your doctor about steps
you can take to prepare for a healthy pregnancy.

Checking blood glucose levels regularly is key to getting a good balance between your
insulin dose and your eating and activity. This is true whether you are injecting
insulin or using an insulin pump.

Regularly monitoring blood glucose and carefully managing insulin doses can help you
avoid two potentially serious problems: hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia.



If people with type 1 diabetes take too much insulin, they can get hypoglycaemia. This happens because their blood glucose drops too low.

Symptoms include feeling very hungry, nervous, shaky, sweaty, dizzy, or confused.
You should talk to your doctor about what you should do if you or your child gets
these symptoms.

If the symptoms are mild, taking glucose tablets or gels, or drinking milk or juice,
may be all the treatment that's needed. However, severe hypoglycaemia is a medical emergency and requires prompt medical treatment.



If people don't take enough insulin, their blood glucose can get too high. This is
called hyperglycaemia, and it also requires prompt treatment.

Hyperglycaemia can cause blurred vision, thirst, frequent urination, and tiredness.
It can also lead to a potentially serious problem called diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), which is a build-up of acids in your blood. This can happen when your blood glucose
is too high for too long. For more detaild information, see our leaflet Diabetic ketoacidosis.



Healthy living
If you or your child has type 1 diabetes, staying healthy doesn't just mean taking
insulin. Eating healthily and being active can also help keep your blood glucose levels
under control.

Also, if you smoke, one of the best things you can do is to stop. Your doctor can
recommend treatments that can help.

Diet
What people eat and drink plays an important role in how well they control their blood
glucose level.

But there isn't a standard diet that you or your child should follow. Instead, doctors
recommend meeting with a dietitian to work out an approach to nutrition that suits you, based on your lifestyle and
food preferences.

Eating regular meals is very important, as skipping meals can affect your glucose
levels and insulin dose. Dietitians also often recommend that people with type 1 diabetes
keep track of the carbohydrates they eat. You may hear this called carb counting.

Carbohydrates supply the body with glucose. Foods high in carbohydrates include pastas,
breads, potatoes, fruits, juice, milk, sweets, and snack foods like biscuits and crisps.

Your dietitian can give you advice on how to estimate the carbs you or your child
eats at each meal. You can then adjust the insulin dose for that meal if necessary.
This can help you better manage blood glucose levels and insulin.

Exercise
Taking regular exercise has many benefits for people with type 1 diabetes. Exercise
uses up glucose, so it can help keep down the level of glucose in the blood. It can
also help people maintain a healthy weight, and feel happier and more relaxed.

Regular activity is just as important for children with type 1 diabetes as for adults.
You should encourage your child to be active every day. This could mean things like:



walking to and from school


making regular trips to the playground, and


encouraging your child to take part in activities such as sport and dance.


For adults, getting regular exercise can sometimes be daunting, especially if they
haven't exercised much in the past. Getting started is sometimes the hardest part.
Be sure to talk to your doctor before starting or changing an exercise programme.

Your doctor will be able to advise you on what kinds of exercise would be best for
you. Doctors usually advise people with type 1 diabetes to do some kind of exercise
most days.

This doesn't need to be strenuous. Walking for 30 minutes each day might be all you
need to do. If you haven't been very active, you should build up your level of exercise
slowly.

Both adults and children may need to take less insulin or eat a snack before exercising,
and check their blood glucose before and after. You should discuss this with your
doctor.

Pregnancy
Having diabetes while pregnant can increase your chance of a miscarriage and of birth
defects in your baby.

But you can help to ensure the best outcomes for you and your baby by talking to your
doctor if you plan to become pregnant. You can then plan the treatment that you will
need before and during pregnancy.

Diabetes care for women planning to become pregnant includes:


counselling about the treatment you will need before and during pregnancy


controlling your blood glucose before and during pregnancy, and


monitoring you for any complications of diabetes that can happen during pregnancy.
All pregnant women need to have regular tests and scans. But if you have diabetes
you will probably need a few more than most women. And you might need to do things like:





stopping taking some medicines - your doctor should ask you about any medicines you
are taking for any reason, and



possibly starting other diabetes medicines during pregnancy.

Type 1 diabetes is a long-term condition that usually starts in childhood or young
adulthood, but which can also occur later in life. Taking insulin, eating a healthy
diet, and staying active can help people with type 1 diabetes live a long and healthy
life.

What is it?
If you have diabetes you have too much glucose in your blood. Glucose is a kind of
sugar that your body uses for energy. But if too much of it builds up in your blood,
it can make you ill.

There are two main types of diabetes: type 1 and type 2. This information is for adults
with type 1 diabetes and parents of children with this condition.

Type 1 diabetes usually starts in childhood, adolescence, or early adulthood, but
it can also start later in adult life.

Everyone needs glucose energy, and everyone needs a hormone called insulin to keep their blood glucose at a healthy level. But when you have type 1 diabetes,
your body stops making insulin or makes very little of it.

This kind of diabetes used to be called insulin-dependent diabetes, because it can
be controlled by taking insulin.

Usually, type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease. This means that the cells in your immune system, which normally fight germs,
attack some of your own cells by mistake. In type 1 diabetes, the immune system attacks
the cells that make insulin.

Doctors don't know why this happens. It might be triggered by viruses, your genes,
or a combination of factors. Sometimes people get type 1 diabetes without having an
autoimmune problem, but this isn't common.

What are the symptoms?
If you or your child develops type 1 diabetes, the symptoms will probably start quite
suddenly, over a few days or weeks. These might include:



needing to urinate more often


feeling very thirsty


feeling very tired or weak


blurred vision


losing weight without trying.


If you or your child has any of these symptoms, it’s important to see a doctor. The
doctor will test your blood glucose level.

What will happen to me?
Many children and adults with type 1 diabetes lead full, healthy lives by keeping
their blood glucose level close to normal, eating healthily, and exercising regularly.


If you've had diabetes for a long time, you have an increased chance of extra health
problems linked to your diabetes. Your eyes, kidneys, feet, and heart are the parts
of your body most likely to be affected. Doctors call these problems complications.

Not everyone with diabetes gets complications. The closer your blood glucose is to
normal, the less likely you are to get complications.

To detect any problems, you or your child will have regular check-ups. These may include
checks of your



blood glucose control


eyes


blood pressure


cholesterol


kidneys


feet, and


nerves.


It's also important that you stay up to date on vaccinations. This includes getting
an annual flu vaccine.

Where to get more help
Diabetes support groups help many people cope with their illness and lead full lives.
These groups can be especially helpful for parents of children with type 1 diabetes,
who may find it a challenge to manage their child's diabetes at times.

You can ask your doctor or diabetes nurse about what groups are available in your
area, or do a search for groups on the internet. For example, in the UK, one registered
charity that provides support and advice to people with diabetes and their families
is Diabetes UK (diabetes.org.uk)

Some women get high levels of glucose (sugar) in their blood when they are pregnant.
This is called gestational diabetes. If you get this kind of diabetes, it can be harmful
to both you and your baby if it isn't treated.

What is gestational diabetes?
Gestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that can happen during pregnancy. If you
have diabetes, it means you have too much glucose in your blood. Glucose is a kind
of sugar that your body uses for energy.

Gestational diabetes can happen at any time during pregnancy, but it is most likely
to develop in the later months. It usually goes away soon after you give birth.

The reasons why gestational diabetes develops are complex. But the simple explanation
is that some women’s bodies are unable to make enough insulin to deal with the extra
demands of pregnancy.

Insulin is a hormone that helps your body use glucose for energy. Without enough insulin,
glucose builds up in your blood. This can cause problems for you and your baby. For
example:



gestational diabetes increases your chance of high blood pressure during pregnancy.
It also increases your chance of a condition called pre-eclampsia, which can be life
threatening



gestational diabetes can cause your baby to grow too large in your womb. This increases
your baby’s chance of being injured during birth or of needing a caesarean section
(C-section) delivery. Babies born to mothers with gestational diabetes may also have
very low blood sugar shortly after birth, or breathing problems.



Gestational diabetes happens in between 3 and 5 of every 100 pregnancies. Things that
can increase your chance of getting gestational diabetes include:



being pregnant when you are older (over age 40)


being very overweight


having gained weight as a young adult (at least 20 kilograms, or around 45 pounds)


smoking


having a condition called polycystic ovary syndrome


having had gestational diabetes in an earlier pregnancy


having a close family member with type 2 diabetes (the most common type of diabetes)


having a non-white ancestry: for example, gestational diabetes is more common in women
who are South Asian, black, or Middle Eastern.



What are the symptoms?
The most common symptoms of gestational diabetes are:


having to urinate frequently, and


being very thirsty.


However, most women don’t get any symptoms. This is because pregnant women are usually
tested and treated for gestational diabetes before it causes symptoms.

Routine testing of pregnant women for gestational diabetes is called screening. Screening for gestational diabetes usually happens in the 24th to 28th week of pregnancy.
But some women are tested earlier if doctors think they have an increased chance of
having the condition.

Doctors in different countries follow different guidelines for deciding which pregnant
women should be offered screening.



In some countries, such as the UK, doctors offer screening to pregnant women who have
an increased chance of having gestational diabetes: for example, if they are very
overweight, have a family history of type 2 diabetes, or have had gestational diabetes
before.



In other countries, such as the US, all pregnant women are offered screening for gestational
diabetes.



There are two main approaches to screening.


One-step testing: This involves having an oral glucose tolerance test. In the morning, you have a blood test to check your glucose level after you’ve had
nothing to eat overnight. You then drink a syrupy glucose drink.

After a certain amount of time, you have further blood tests to see how your body
is handling the extra glucose. You are diagnosed with gestational diabetes if your
glucose is above a certain level in any of the blood tests.



Two-step testing: You first have a glucose challenge test. This involves drinking a glucose drink and then having a blood test an hour later
to see how your body handles the extra glucose.

If your blood glucose is below a certain level, you are unlikely to have gestational
diabetes and you don’t need another test. But, if it is above a certain level, you
then have an oral glucose tolerance test to find out if you have gestational diabetes.

This is similar to the oral glucose tolerance test described above. But for this test
your glucose must be high in two blood tests for you to be diagnosed with gestational
diabetes.



What treatments work?
The goal of treatment is to return your blood glucose level to a range that is healthy
for a woman who is pregnant.

Many women will be able to lower their glucose level by changing what they eat and
exercising. Others will need to also have insulin injections.

You and your doctor will discuss which treatments are best for you. You will also
need to regularly check your glucose level, to make sure your treatment is working.


Diet and exercise
Your doctor, a nurse, or a dietician should work with you to come up with an eating plan to lower your glucose level. This will most likely involve eating:



less fatty and sugary foods, and


more whole grains, fruit and vegetables, and sources of lean protein, such as chicken
and fish.



One diet often recommended is the low-glycaemic diet. It focuses on eating foods that release glucose into your bloodstream slowly (such
as whole grains), while cutting back on foods that release glucose quickly (such as
white bread and sweets).

For example, you might:


eat porridge in the morning rather than cereal


have whole-grain bread at lunch rather than white bread, and


opt for brown rice for the evening meal rather than white rice.


Regular exercise can also help lower your glucose level, as your body uses more glucose for energy
when you’re physically active.

Your doctor will probably recommend that you try to exercise most days of the week.
Good exercise options when you’re pregnant include brisk walking and swimming. If
you haven’t exercised in a while, it’s best to start slowly and gradually increase
how much you do.

No single diet or exercise plan is right for all women. Your healthcare team can help
you explore what’s best for you.

Insulin treatment
If changing your diet and exercising don’t lower your glucose level enough, or if
your glucose level is very high to begin with, your doctor will probably recommend
that you have insulin treatment.

This involves giving yourself daily injections of insulin. Your healthcare team will
teach you how to do this.

Your doctor will carefully work out how much insulin you need, to make sure you take
an amount that is safe for you and your baby.

Monitoring your glucose level
Keeping a close check on your blood glucose level is an important part of treatment,
particularly if you’re taking insulin.

Your doctor may recommend that you check your glucose level several times a day: for
example, when you first get up and after meals. This will help guide your treatment
and ensure that your glucose level is being well controlled.

You can test your glucose level with a device called a glucose meter. It uses a small
drop of blood, usually from your finger, to check your glucose. This may sound difficult
or scary, but most people get used to it with practice.

What will happen?
If you have gestational diabetes, treatment can help you have a healthy pregnancy
and a healthy baby. Your diabetes will probably go away soon after you give birth.

However, you have an increased chance of getting gestational diabetes again in future
pregnancies. You can talk to your doctor about how to reduce the chance of this happening
if you are planning to become pregnant again.

Women who’ve had gestational diabetes have an increased chance of getting type 2 diabetes.
Just as regular exercise and a healthy diet are important in treating gestational
diabetes, they are equally important in helping to prevent type 2 diabetes. Reaching
and maintaining a healthy post-baby weight will also lower your risk.

Your doctor will also probably recommend having regular tests to check your glucose
level. You will probably be tested in the first few months after giving birth, and
at least every few years after. These tests can give you an early warning if your
glucose is climbing too high, so you can take steps to lower it.

If you have any questions or concerns, be sure to talk to your doctor."

Dermatitis means inflammation of the skin. There are several types of dermatitis.
The kind described here affects parts of the skin where there are creases, such as
around your mouth and nose, or where you have hair, such as your eyebrows. It's called
seborrhoeic dermatitis.
When this type of dermatitis affects the scalp it is more commonly called dandruff.
This information deals only with seborrhoeic dermatitis on the body.

We've brought together the best research about seborrhoeic dermatitis and weighed
up the evidence about how to treat it. You can use our information to talk to your
doctor and decide which treatments are best for you.

What is seborrhoeic dermatitis?
If you have seborrhoeic dermatitis you get inflamed or flaky skin. The inflamed skin
is usually on parts of your body that have hair, or where there are folds or creases
in your skin. These are the areas of skin with lots of sebaceous glands. These glands make oil to lubricate your skin.

We're not really sure why seborrhoeic dermatitis happens to some people and not to
others. Some types of yeast grow naturally on oily parts of the body. It might be
that some people's immune systems are particularly sensitive to yeasts, and this may
play a part in causing seborrhoeic dermatitis.

Your immune system is your body’s defence against infection. If your immune system
over-reacts to something it can cause irritation.

What are the symptoms?
The main symptom of seborrhoeic dermatitis is irritated or flaky skin. The flakes
may be greasy and are often white or yellowish. Irritated patches of skin look a bit
like sunburn.

This type of dermatitis tends to affect the face and nose, especially between your
nose and the corners of your mouth. It may also affect your eyebrows, ears, chest,
armpits, or groin. It can also affect your scalp and cause severe dandruff (see our
separate information on dandruff).

Skin affected by dermatitis may be itchy. Try not to scratch too much, as you could
break the skin and cause an infection.

What treatments work?
Although seborrhoeic dermatitis isn't usually harmful you may not like the way it
looks or feels. Fortunately treatment can help control the symptoms.

The first thing to remember is to keep the affected areas of your skin clean and as
dry as possible.

The two main treatments for seborrhoeic dermatits are antifungal creams and steroid creams that you apply to your skin. These are often used separately, but doctors sometimes
prescribe both together.

Steroid creams (the full name of this type of steroid is corticosteroid) work by reducing inflammation
of the skin. For dermatitis on the face or on creased skin you should use a gentle
(low-potency) steroid cream. Your doctor can advise you about how to use these creams.

Steroids do have side effects in some people, but using a steroid cream for a short
time shouldn't cause serious problems. Possible side effects include thinning of your
skin and slight changes of skin colour. If you're using a steroid cream on your face,
make sure you keep it out of your eyes.

Antifungal creams can help clear up dermatitis by killing yeasts that grow on the skin.

Some people find that antifungal treatments irritate their skin. If this happens to
you, talk to your doctor about trying a different treatment. You should be careful
that antifungal creams don't get in your eyes. If this happens, wash out your eyes
thoroughly with plenty of water.

Other treatments
Creams that calm down your immune system, called calcineurin inhibitors, can be used to reduce the inflammation in your skin. They don't work as well as
steroid creams but specialists sometimes recommend them for people who have skin thinning
caused by steroid cream. Long-term use of this treatment has been linked to cancer,
so doctors are cautious about prescribing it.

If your dermatitis is widespread and creams don’t work, your doctor might suggest
antifungal tablets. But they aren't used much, as they can cause serious side effects.

What will happen to me?
For many people seborrhoeic dermatitis comes and goes over time. You might find you
need to have more treatment from time to time, or you might need to try different
treatments. Some treatments can be used regularly, to help stop dermatitis coming
back. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how often you should be using your treatment.

Some people find that their dermatitis gets worse when they're feeling stressed or
not sleeping properly. Dermatitis can get worse in winter and start to clear up in
the summer, possibly because getting more sunlight helps."

Depression is an illness that affects people of all ages, including children and teenagers.
It can stop a child or teenager getting the most out of life. But there are treatments
that can help young people get better.

This information is about treatments that can help children and teenagers aged 6 to
18. You can use our information to talk to your doctor and decide which treatments
are best for your child.

To learn more about the signs and symptoms of depression in young people, see the
leaflet Depression in children and teenagers: what is it?

Treatments
Most depressed young people can be helped with treatment. This could be with 'talking
treatments' (psychotherapies), or with medicines, or with a combination of these.

But it might be that neither of these treatments is necessary. Your doctor might recommend
starting with a few weeks of monitoring, as well as supportive care and education
for both the child and parents.

The child's school counselling services might also be involved. For many children
this is all the treatment they need to get better.

Urgent measures
Young people with depression are rarely a danger to themselves or to other people.
But doctors must assess this risk right away, just in case.

If your doctor is concerned about this, he or she might decide that your child needs
to be admitted to hospital. This is so that your child:



can be kept safe and is not a danger to him- or herself




is not a danger to anyone else, and


can have an urgent mental-health assessment.


But this doesn’t happen often, and most young people with depression are not admitted
to hospital.

Phases of treatment
Treating young people with depression is often divided into three phases.
Phase 1 lasts from 6 to 12 weeks. The aim is that, at the end of this period, your child's
symptoms will have eased or that he or she has no symptoms at all.

Phase 2 lasts from 6 to 12 months. The aim of treatment in this phase is to stop the depression
from coming back (called a relapse).

Phase 3 can last for another year or two. Not all young people need treatment by this time.
But some have severe or long-lasting depression which needs longer treatment.

First treatments
Early in your child’s treatment, you might hear your doctor talk about active monitoring. This means that your doctor doesn’t start right away with a specific treatment -
such as medication or formal therapy.

Instead, as the name suggests, active monitoring involves monitoring your child while
taking an active role in how he or she is feeling. This usually involves helping you
and your child to learn about depression, and to discuss it.

Your doctor might also suggest simple lifestyle changes for your child. For example,
healthy diet and regular exercise are known to help prevent and reduce symptoms of
depression.

Problems that can go along with depression
People with depression often have to deal with problems that can happen at the same
time, such as sleep problems (insomnia) and agitation.

Your doctor might suggest that prescribing medicines to help with these problems might
help your child through the early stages of depression.

If your doctor suggests medicines to help your child with either of these problems,
he or she should discuss with you how they work and any possible side effects. You
should ask any questions you want about these and any medicines your doctor prescribes
for your child's depression.

Other mental-health conditions
Depression can sometimes affect young people alongside other mental-health issues.
Conditions that commonly go along with depression (and that can sometimes cause it)
include anxiety and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

Your child might already be having treatment for another condition. Or the symptoms
of depression and of another problem might begin at the same time.

Either way, when planning your child’s treatment, your doctor should take into account
how the different conditions and treatments interact. He or she should also discuss
these issues with you, and you should feel free to ask any questions that you have.

Talking treatments, medicines, and combinations of these
Many young people recover from depression after a period of active monitoring. And
even if they have ongoing monitoring, they might not need medication or psychotherapy.

But for young people who have longer-term or more severe problems, there are several
treatments available.

Talking treatments
If your child is very depressed, or if he or she doesn't get better after a period
of monitoring and supportive care, talking treatments are recommended. These include
interpersonal therapy and cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT).

It's not clear if either works better than the other. Unfortunately these talking
treatments are not always available and can be hard to access in some areas.

In interpersonal therapy, children and teenagers work with a therapist to learn new and better ways of getting
along with other people. It's based on the idea that depression is often linked to
relationship problems, like fights with parents or having trouble making friends.

Most people who have this treatment meet their therapist once a week for three or
four months.

There's good evidence that cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) can help relieve the symptoms of depression.

Some children and teenagers have this therapy one to one with a therapist while others
have therapy with a group of others. Both methods seem to work well.

CBT aims to help people make positive changes to the way they think and behave. The
young person works with a therapist to try to change unhelpful ways of thinking about
themselves and the world.

These negative ways of thinking might be making the young person depressed: for example,
if someone thinks they are no good at anything. Through CBT they try to learn to think
and behave in a more positive way.

Most people who have CBT meet their therapist for about 20 sessions over about 12
weeks. But some younger people need treatment for longer. Longer courses seem to be
more helpful.

For many young people, one course of therapy is enough. But depression can return
in some people a while after they stop having treatment. So your child might need
to have more treatment.

Medicines
Doctors are cautious about prescribing antidepressants to people under 18, and especially
to children under 12. But they might recommend them if your child's depression is
very bad or if talking treatments alone haven't worked.

Some antidepressants of a type called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)
can help some young people with severe depression. But they can have side effects.

Children and young people are usually only given SSRIs if they are also having a talking
treatment. Research has found that SSRIs combined with cognitive behaviour therapy
(CBT) works well for teenagers with moderate or severe depression.

Some young people take these medicines only until they feel better. But others find
they need to keep taking it to stop their depression coming back.

SSRIs can have side effects in some people. They are usually mild and not long lasting.
But your doctor should discuss them with you carefully. These side effects can include:



loss of appetite. This can cause weight loss


headaches


sleep problems


feeling tired


shakiness (tremors)


diarrhoea


vomiting, and


rash.


These side effects are usually mild and don't last long. But a small number of children
find the side effects are so bad that they need to stop taking these medicines: for
example, some children get a severe rash.

There is a small chance that children taking SSRIs might hurt themselves or think
about suicide. If your child is given medicine for depression your doctor should check
regularly to make sure the depression isn't getting worse. This is less likely to
happen if they are also having a talking treatment at the same time.

Children or teenagers taking SSRIs shouldn't stop or reduce their dose suddenly, as
this can cause withdrawal symptoms. These are less likely to happen if their doctor
lowers the dose gradually.

Withdrawal symptoms from SSRIs include:


feeling dizzy or light headed


feeling tired or drowsy, and


headaches.


It's unusual for children to be treated with antidepressants other than SSRIs, but
it's sometimes necessary if SSRIs don't work or cause severe side effects. If your
doctor prescribes another medicine, ask him or her to explain why.

Things you can do to help your child
If you think your child may be depressed you should talk to your child's doctor. Here
are some other things you can do if you think your child is at risk of depression.



Problems at school can trigger depression in young people. For example, they may be
being bullied or having a hard time with school work. You can talk to teachers, school
counsellors, or school psychologists to find out more. Also, consider whether problems
at home might have played a part.



Encourage your child to stay active and be healthy. Regular exercise can help reduce
symptoms of depression in children. Eating a varied, healthy diet, including plenty
of fruit and vegetables, can also help.



Some people take a herbal treatment called St. John's wort for depression. Although
there's some evidence that it might work for adults, it's not clear whether it is
safe or helpful for children with depression. You shouldn't give St. John's wort to
a child without talking to your doctor first.

St. John's wort can also interfere with the way some other medicines work. It should
not be taken with migraine medicines called triptans or with antidepressants.

Some people also try omega-3 supplements. There is some evidence that these can help.
But again, you should not give these to a child without talking to your doctor, as
they can interact with other medications."

Depression is an illness that affects people of all ages, including children and teenagers.
It can stop a child or teenager getting the most out of life. But there are treatments
that can help young people get better.

Here, we discuss the signs and symptoms of depression in children and teenagers and
how it's diagnosed. To learn more about treatments, see Depression in children and teenagers: what treatments work?

What happens when children get depressed?
Adults aren't the only ones who get depressed. But depressed young people often hide
their feelings. As a parent, you may find it hard to tell if your child is depressed
or just going through a phase.

Depression is an illness. It can get worse if it isn't treated. But depressed children
can be helped with the right treatment. This information is about depression in children
and teenagers aged 6 to 18.

No one knows for sure what causes some children and teenagers to get depression. In
teenagers it's more common among girls. Depression may also run in some families.

Depression in young people is often triggered by events: for example, the death of
a parent, a long-term illness, the breakup of a friendship, or worries about school
work.

What are the symptoms?
The symptoms of depression in children and young people are not always the same as
those in adults.

These are the symptoms you might notice if your child or teen is depressed:


Being sad or irritable most of the day, nearly every day


Losing interest in the activities they used to enjoy


Losing weight without dieting, or being less interested in eating


Sleeping too much or too little, and having no energy


Seeming unusually restless or sluggish


Blaming themselves for things that go wrong: feeling worthless or guilty for no reason


Having trouble concentrating or making decisions; your child's schoolwork might suffer


Thinking or talking a lot about death.


Younger children may have physical symptoms with no obvious cause, like headaches,
stomach aches, or pains in the arms or legs.

Young people with depression might harm themselves. Some might cut themselves or think
about suicide. They may also drink alcohol or use drugs.

Children or teenagers who are at risk of harming themselves need immediate help and
protection. They will probably need to be admitted to hospital or to another kind
of healthcare facility straight away.

Young people don't need to have all of these symptoms to be depressed. But if your
child has the first two symptoms and at least two others for at least two weeks, they
could have depression. If you think this is the case with your child, talk to your
doctor.

What will happen to my child?
Depression can badly affect your child's development, both in their social life and
in their school life. A bout of depression in a young person lasts, on average, seven
months.

Some children recover from depression without treatment, but at least half of children
who don’t have treatment will still be depressed after a year. That’s why it’s important
to get help. The right treatment can help a child or young person recover from depression
more quickly.

Children who have had a bout of depression may get another one in future, either as
a child or teenager, or when they are older. Knowing which treatments help can be
very useful in helping manage these relapses.

Some teenagers and children with depression try to kill themselves. Any parent will
find this very painful to consider. But being alert, and knowing how to get emergency
medical help for your child, can help prevent this happening.

Some children and teenagers need to be hospitalised for a while if they are a danger
to themselves or others. But this is rare.

If children say they are thinking about suicide it's a clear sign that they need help.
You need to take this very seriously. Call your doctor straight away. You can also
make an emergency plan with your doctor, to use if you become worried that your child
is suicidal.

Where to get more help
Depending where you live, there may be charities and other groups that help young
people with depression.

For example, Young Minds is a UK charity for children and young people with mental
health problems, and their parents (youngminds.org.uk). Your doctor might be able
to help you find support in your area, or you can search online."

Treatments for depression can work well, improving your symptoms and helping you feel
more like yourself again.

The main options are medicines called antidepressants and talking treatments (psychotherapies). Having both an antidepressant and a talking treatment works best
for some people, especially if they have more severe depression.

Talking treatments
If you have mild or moderate depression, a talking treatment may be all you need.
However, many people have a talking treatment combined with an antidepressant. Here
are the most common talking treatments for depression:

Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is based on the idea that the thoughts you have and certain beliefs you have about
your life cause you to think the worst of yourself.

This can make you depressed. You may automatically think the worst about yourself
and the world without realising it. The aim of cognitive behavioural therapy is to
change this way of thinking to help you look at things more positively.

Interpersonal therapy helps you learn new and better ways of relating to other people, including family,
friends and workmates. This can help you build stronger relationships so you have
better social support and cope better day to day.

Problem-solving therapy teaches you how to solve problems in a step-by-step way. You work out what the problem
is, work out ideas about how to solve it, choose a solution and decide on the steps
you can take to get there. These new skills are designed to help you cope better with
life's problems.

Your doctor can help you decide what type of talking treatment is right for you. You
may have a combination of these therapies. Many people have weekly therapy sessions
for at least three or four months.

Antidepressants
Antidepressants work well for many people. There are several types of antidepressant.
You can talk with your doctor about which one might suit you.

You may feel somewhat better within one to two weeks of starting an antidepressant,
but it often takes six to eight weeks to feel a lot better. So it's important not
to stop taking them if they don't seem to be working right away.

Once an antidepressant is working, doctors usually recommend taking it for nine to
12 months. However, if you've had depression before and it has come back, your doctor
may recommend taking it for longer.

Side effects of antidepressants
Antidepressants can cause side effects in some people. Common ones include:


a dry mouth


dizziness


an upset stomach, and


problems sleeping.


Your doctor should help you find the antidepressant that works best for you, and which
causes the fewest side effects.

Some antidepressants can sometimes cause more serious side effects. Your doctor should
discuss these with you and tell you what to look out for.

Some antidepressants can cause withdrawal symptoms if you stop taking them suddenly
or if your dose is reduced. Talk to your doctor first if you decide you want to stop
taking an antidepressant.

Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)
Most people think of ECT as a treatment from the past, and as something cruel and
frightening. And to be fair, that is a fairly accurate picture of how it was used
many years ago.

But modern ECT techniques are painless and helpful to many people with severe depression
who have not improved with other treatments.

No one is really sure exactly how it works, but it could be linked to improved flow
of blood and chemicals in parts of the brain. Either way, after a course of sessions,
many people say that they feel much better.

ECT delivers weak, short electric currents into the brain. It is done under general
anaesthetic, so you're asleep during the treatment. A course of treatment is about
12 sessions. People usually have two or three sessions a week.

The main side effect of ECT is short-term memory loss. If you have this treatment,
your doctor should explain all the possible side effects to you in detail.

Things you can do for yourself
When you are depressed, it's hard to cope with everyday things like looking after
yourself. But eating well, keeping active and staying in touch with friends can all
be helpful.

There's some research to show that doing exercise may help you feel better. If you are depressed, exercise may be the last thing you
feel like doing. But gentle exercise like walking or swimming may lift your mood.
Some research suggests that yoga and tai chi may also be helpful.

Other treatments that may be beneficial include relaxation therapy, light therapy and acupuncture. Some people are also helped by self-help books based on cognitive behavioural therapy.

A herbal treatment called St. John's wort may help if you have mild or moderate depression. However, St. John's wort can interfere
with the way other medicines work, such as the contraceptive pill, and medicines for
diabetes and high blood pressure.

Before taking St. John's wort, be sure to check with your doctor or pharmacist. You
also shouldn't take it along with an antidepressant.

Side effects of St. John's wort can include stomach problems (such as nausea or diarrhoea),
dizziness, confusion, tiredness, and a dry mouth."

Depression is not the same as feeling a bit low. Depression is an illness that can
affect how you feel and behave for weeks or months. But there are good treatments
that can help you recover.

What is depression?
It's normal to be sad from time to time. But depression is more than feeling unhappy
sometimes. When you are depressed, your low mood lasts much longer and affects other
parts of your life, such as your sleep, relationships, job, and appetite. It's not
something you can just snap out of.

There are different types of depression. This information is about major depression. It's also sometimes called clinical depression.

Doctors aren't sure exactly why people get depression, but it could be related to
changes in how the brain works. The brain sends signals from nerve to nerve using
special chemicals called neurotransmitters. If you have depression, certain neurotransmitters may be out of balance and not
working properly.

Events in your life can play a role in whether you get depression. For example, depression
can be triggered by stressful events like the break-up of a relationship, the death of a loved one, or financial trouble.


Family history can also play a part in depression, as the illness may be related to
the genes you inherit from your parents. Hormones can contribute to depression as well, especially for women.

You are also more likely to get depression if you have a physical illness - for example,
if you've had a stroke or heart attack, or have a long-term condition, such as diabetes
or lung disease.

Social isolation (for example, not having friends or family around) can also increase
your chance of depression.

What are the symptoms?
Depression can make you feel like you can't cope with everyday life.
The main symptoms are:


feeling sad most of the time, and


losing interest in things you used to enjoy.


If you are depressed, you will have at least one of these main symptoms, as well as
some of the following symptoms, nearly every day for at least two weeks:



Little appetite or more appetite than usual, which can lead to significant weight
loss or gain



Problems sleeping, or sleeping too much


Feeling either agitated or sluggish


Feeling very tired or low in energy


Feeling worthless or excessively guilty


Finding it hard to think and concentrate


Thinking about suicide.


To be diagnosed with major depression you need to have at least five symptoms in total.
Your doctor will check that your symptoms aren't caused by anything else. For example,
certain medicines, along with some medical conditions and infections, can cause the
same symptoms as depression.

Your doctor will ask you some questions, and probably do blood and urine tests to rule these things out.

Your doctor will also ask if you've been treated for depression before, and may ask
about your use of drugs and alcohol. These things can affect your treatment.

What will happen to me?
Treatments help many people recover from depression. The main options are medicines
called antidepressants and talking treatments (psychotherapies). To learn more, see our leaflet Depression in adults: what treatments work'

About half of people who are treated for a bout of major depression will have a recurrence
in their lifetime.

This might sound concerning. But it can be helpful to know this. It means that you
can be prepared, and see your doctor if you feel as if you are becoming depressed
again. And if you ever find yourself thinking about suicide, be sure to seek help
straight away.

Even though depression is a serious illness, many people are able to manage their
condition and live fulfilling and rewarding lives. A bout of depression can feel overwhelming,
but many people in a similar position to you have gone on to make a good recovery.


Where to get more help
There are support groups and charities that offer help and advice to people with depression.
You can ask your doctor for a recommendation, or search online. One example in the
UK is The Depression Alliance (depressionalliance.org), which runs self-help groups
for people with depression."

A dental abscess is an infected pocket of pus that forms at the root of a tooth or
in the nearby tissue or bone. It can be very painful but most people recover quickly
with treatment.

However, if an abscess is not treated early on, the infection can spread and this
can be dangerous.

You can use our information to talk to your dentist and decide which treatments are
right for you.

What treatments work?
To treat an abscess the dentist needs to remove the source of the infection. This
can be done in two ways.

A root canal treatment
This is the most common treatment for an abscess at the root of a tooth. The dentist
drills a small hole in the tooth and cleans out the bacteria and dead tissue inside
the tooth’s centre (the root canal).

When the centre of the tooth is clean the dentist fills and seals the tooth. You might
need more than one visit to the dentist to complete this treatment.

Removing the tooth
If a tooth is badly damaged from decay or an injury, the dentist will take it out.
When the abscess is alongside the tooth, the tooth might also need to be removed if
the bone and tissue holding it in place have been damaged.

Along with these treatments, your dentist might also make a small cut in your abscess and insert a tiny tube to drain it. You will probably have the tube in place for two to five days. This will help to
get rid of the infection and allow the area to heal.

If you have an abscess alongside a tooth and the tooth doesn’t need to be removed,
draining the abscess and having deep cleaning around the tooth and gums might be the
main treatment you need.

If you have an abscess caused by your gums partly covering a wisdom tooth your dentist
might recommend removing the tooth. Wisdom teeth sit far back in your mouth and are
often difficult to clean and floss, which can increase the chance of further problems.

A non-wisdom tooth with this type of abscess might also need to be removed if it has
been badly damaged.

However, if the tooth can be saved, your dentist will probably recommend having a
small operation to remove the gum tissue covering the tooth. This should help prevent future problems.

During these treatments you will probably have a local anaesthetic to numb the area being worked on, so you will not feel any pain. You might also be
offered a medicine to help you relax.

Some people feel quite anxious about dental work. If you have any questions or concerns
be sure to discuss these with your dentist.

As well as the treatments in and around your tooth and gums, your dentist might recommend
taking a course of antibiotics. This will help your body get rid of any remaining infection.

An abscess can be very painful. Most people take medicine to help them cope with the
pain both before treatment and after, while they’re recovering.

Over-the-counter painkillers such as ibuprofen work for many people. However, if your pain is severe, your dentist
might prescribe a stronger pain medicine.

What is a dental abscess?
If you have a dental abscess you have an infection in a tooth or in the nearby tissues
or bone. This infection creates a pocket of pus (an abscess). Pus is a thick, yellowish
fluid that the body makes to help fight an infection.

There are three main types of dental abscess and they happen for different reasons.




An abscess at the root of a tooth. This is the most common type. It happens when the soft tissue inside the tooth (the
pulp) becomes infected with bacteria and dies. This leads to an abscess forming at
the end of the tooth’s root.

Bacteria often enter the tooth because of advanced tooth decay that reaches into the
centre of the tooth. Bacteria can also enter a tooth if it is injured (for example,
cracked or broken). You might hear this type of abscess called a periapical abscess.



An abscess alongside a tooth. This type of abscess happens when the tissues around a tooth (the gums) are infected
with bacteria.

These abscesses are usually caused by advanced gum disease, where bacteria have travelled
well below the surface of the gums and are damaging the bone and tissues around the
tooth. This is called a periodontal abscess.



An abscess in gum tissue partly covering a tooth. Sometimes a tooth doesn’t fully break through the gums when it’s growing in. This
is most likely to happen with wisdom teeth, which are the last adult teeth to grow
in.

When a tooth is partly covered, keeping it clean can be difficult and bacteria can
spread under the gums, causing an abscess. This is called a pericoronal abscess.



What are the symptoms?
The main symptom of a dental abscess is intense continuing pain. The pain is sometimes
described as throbbing, gnawing, sharp, or shooting.

Other common symptoms of an abscess include:


redness and swelling (inflammation). This starts at the site of the abscess. It might
look like you have a spot on your gums. As the infection gets worse the swelling might
spread, affecting more of your mouth. People with an abscess alongside their tooth
often get swelling before they get pain.



tooth sensitivity to hot or cold foods and drinks


a bad taste in your mouth and bad breath


a high temperature (fever).


Signs of a more severe infection include:


a very high fever


difficulty opening your mouth


widespread swelling that affects your face


difficulty swallowing


difficulty breathing.


If you have signs of a severe infection you should get treatment straight away. Breathing
difficulties can be especially dangerous, and need emergency treatment in hospital.

Other people who might need hospital treatment include the very young or old, or those
who have other health problems that might make an abscess more dangerous or hard to
treat, such as lung disease, heart failure, HIV, or cancer.

Even if your symptoms aren’t severe it’s important to see your dentist without delay.
Treatment can relieve your symptoms and stop the infection getting worse.

To diagnose an abscess your dentist will ask you questions about your symptoms and
examine your teeth and gums. You will also have a mouth X-ray. This can show where
the infection is, how far it has spread, and whether there is damage to your tooth
or bone.

Your dentist might also do a blood test to check for signs of infection.
What will happen to me?
With treatment most people recover quickly from a dental abscess. But it’s important
to get an abscess treated as soon as possible. If you wait and the infection spreads
this can lead to more serious problems that might need treatment in hospital.

If your tooth had to be removed you might want to have it replaced with an artificial
tooth both for practical and cosmetic reasons. For example, a missing tooth can affect
your chewing and speaking as well as your appearance. There are three main options
for replacing a tooth. You could have:



a dental implant (a new tooth is attached to a metal post implanted into your jaw
bone)



a bridge (a new tooth is attached to one or both teeth at either side of the missing
tooth)



a partial denture (a new tooth is attached to a frame that sits in your mouth and
can be removed).



If your tooth was damaged but not removed your dentist might recommend you get a crown.
This means attaching a partial tooth to what’s left of the old tooth.

Most dental abscesses happen because of poor dental care. To prevent future problems
it’s important to:



brush your teeth at least twice a day with a fluoride toothpaste


try to limit sugary foods and drinks (such as flavoured fizzy drinks)


have regular dental checkups and cleanings


make sure any areas of decay (cavities) are treated quickly so the decay doesn’t spread."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1488798952459/Dengue%20fever,Dengue fever,"Dengue fever Last published: Aug 30, 2022
Dengue fever is a viral infection that’s spread by mosquitoes in some parts of the
world. Most people recover completely but some people have more severe symptoms and
need hospital treatment.

What is dengue fever?
Dengue fever is caused by a virus spread by the Aedes mosquito. This mosquito lives
in areas with tropical and near-tropical climates, including Southeast Asia, Western
Pacific regions, the Caribbean, Latin America, and some parts of the US (such as Texas
and Hawaii), Africa, and the Middle East.

You can’t catch dengue fever in most western countries. But you can become infected
if you travel to a region where dengue fever is ‘endemic’ (endemic means that it’s
often found there).

There are four types or ‘strains’ of dengue fever virus. Infection with any one of
them can cause the illness that we call dengue fever.

Preventing dengue fever
Most people who get dengue fever recover with no lasting ill effects. But it’s best
to avoid getting it in the first place.

There are several things you can do to help prevent dengue fever if you are in an
area where it is endemic. It’s important to remember that the mosquitoes that carry
this virus bite mainly during the day.



Cover up as much as possible. Wear clothes that don’t leave large areas of your skin
exposed.



Use mosquito repellents on areas of your skin not covered by clothes.


Use mosquito nets on windows and around beds when possible.


Use plug-in insecticides and other mosquito-killing devices indoors.


Use mosquito nets and mosquito-killing devices around people who are sick with dengue
fever, to prevent mosquitoes biting them and spreading the virus.



Stay away from bodies of still water, such as ponds. And make sure water doesn’t collect
in pots and other containers near where you are living.



What are the symptoms?
The symptoms of dengue fever are similar to those of many bacterial and viral infections,
which makes an exact diagnosis difficult without testing your blood. So if you have
been in an area in the last two weeks where dengue is endemic and you then become
ill with symptoms of a fever, it’s important to tell your doctor.

The most common symptoms of dengue fever are:


A fever, which usually lasts between 5 and 7 days


A rash or flushing of the skin


Backache and other types of pain, such as a headache at the front of your head or
sore bones



Symptoms in your digestive system, such as loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, and
stomach pain.



Most people recover from dengue fever with no special treatment. But some people have
more severe symptoms and need treatment in hospital. Symptoms that may need treatment
in the hospital include:



Tiredness and restlessness


Fainting


Bleeding from the nose or gums


Small red spots on the skin caused by bleeding into the skin


Vaginal bleeding or bleeding in the stomach.


And it’s important for the medical staff to make sure that you get a correct diagnosis
so that you’re not given treatments for another condition that you don’t have, which
might be harmful.

What treatments work?
There is no specific drug treatment for dengue fever. But some people may need medical
treatments such as fluids given by intravenous (IV) drip. The treatments for dengue
fever are the same for adults as for children.

Any treatment that you need will be based on how severe your symptoms are.
Mild infection
If your doctor is satisfied that your symptoms are mild, you should be able to recover
at home. But your doctor might still want to keep a close eye on you and test your
blood regularly.

Your doctor will recommend that you drink plenty of fluids. Clear soups, fruit juices,
and special rehydration products are better than plain water, as they contain nutrition
as well as just fluid.

But avoid liquids that are red or brown in colour. This is because, if you vomit,
your doctor will want to know if there is blood in your vomit. Red and brown fluids
can be mistaken for blood or disguise the presence of blood.

Apart from drinking plenty of fluids, the best advice is to:


Rest until you feel well again


Ease your fever by sponging with cool (not cold) water


Take paracetamol for pain or fever if you need to, but


Don’t take aspirin, ibuprofen, or similar drugs (these are called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs, or NSAIDs for short), as they can cause internal bleeding



Go to hospital straight away if your symptoms get worse or if you get new symptoms.




More severe infection
If your symptoms are more severe, you will need to be treated in hospital. You will
probably be given fluids by an intravenous (IV) drip, and you will need to have regular
blood and urine tests to check how well your body is fighting the infection.

People with the most severe infections may need a blood transfusion.
Infection in pregnancy
Dengue fever during pregnancy can cause serious problems. For example, it can lead
to your baby having a low birth weight. If you get dengue fever while pregnant you
will need to be treated in hospital.

If you are visiting an area where dengue is endemic while pregnant, it is especially
important to take all the precautions you possibly can against mosquito bites. The
mosquitoes that carry dengue fever are the same ones that carry Zika and an infection
called chikungunya.

What will happen?
Most people recover from dengue fever without any long-term effects. Some people get
a rash as they recover. But this doesn’t last.

Your doctor might want to test your blood in the first few weeks after you have recovered.
It’s also a good idea to avoid strenuous exercise and alcohol for a few weeks after
you get better. This avoids putting too much pressure on organs such as your liver,
which may have been weakened by the illness.

It is rare for anyone to die from dengue fever unless they have a severe infection.
Up to 3 in 100 people with a severe infection die from dengue fever. Severe infection
is more common in children.

As there are four types of dengue virus it’s possible to get the infection more than
once. And dengue fever is not the only disease that mosquitoes spread. So it’s important
to keep taking precautions against mosquito bites if you are in an area where dengue
fever is endemic."

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD for short) happens when nerve cells at the front and
sides of the brain are damaged.

It is less common than some other types of dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease. About 5 in every 100 people with dementia have FTD.

FTD usually affects people at a younger age than Alzheimer’s does. It most commonly
affects people aged 45 to 65. But it can start even earlier.

The main symptoms of FTD are changes in personality and social behaviour, and problems
with speech and language. It is always fatal, usually after several years.

Almost half of people with FTD also have signs of parkinsonism, such as shaking and stiff muscles. And a small number of people with FTD develop
motor neuron disease (MND), also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

It’s not always possible to say what causes FTD. But we know that genetics (the genes you inherit from your parents) and severe head injuries can cause the condition in many people.

Doctors sometimes group FTD into two types, although the symptoms can overlap:


Behavioural FTD mainly causes problems with personality and social conduct. This type can be hard
to spot and diagnose, because the symptoms are similar to those of several other mental-health
problems.



Primary progressive aphasia mainly affects speech and language.



What are the symptoms?
The early symptoms of FTD often involve changes in personality and behaviour. They
include:



Changes in social behaviour. It’s often said that someone’s personality becomes more
'coarse', and that they become less polite and more direct. For example, they may
seem rude or uncaring



Struggling with self-control: someone may struggle to control their emotions, or act
on impulse. For example, someone may suddenly start spending money without thinking
if they can afford to



Being less interested in looking after themselves. For example, they may not care
much about how they look



Seeming to care less than usual about other people’s needs


Problems speaking clearly and understanding what is said to them. These language problems
get worse over time



Being easily distracted


Developing rigid routines and habits, and


Changes in eating habits. For example, many people with FTD often crave sweet foods.


Symptoms that affect people with other types of dementia, such as problems with memory,
can also affect people with FTD. But not usually in the early stages.

If you see your doctor about your symptoms, they will ask you about them (or about
the symptoms of the person you are caring for). This helps to know if your symptoms
are more to do with behaviour or with speech and language.

Your doctor will also ask about whether you (they) have symptoms that suggest parkinsonism
or MND, such as shaking and muscle weakness.

Making a careful record of symptoms will help your doctor to plan the care that will
be needed. For example, people with FTD will gradually develop disabilities such as:



Confusion


Struggling to communicate


Loss of bladder and bowel control, and


Problems with basic tasks, such as washing and dressing.


Tests
Your doctor will probably want to do tests related to your symptoms. These could include:




Cognitive tests. These tests are often in the form of questions. They look at things
like speech, understanding, and thinking



Blood tests, to rule out physical causes of your symptoms, such as thyroid or vitamin
problems, and



Scans of the brain.


What treatments are available?
As with other types of dementia, there is no cure for FTD. Most treatments are aimed
at keeping people and their carers as safe and supported as possible.

But there are things that can help people with FTD to communicate and enjoy life,
even when their symptoms get worse over time.

These are many of the same treatments and techniques that have been found to help
people with other types of dementia, and can include therapies based around:



Music


Dance


Exercise, and


Reminiscence therapy (focusing on happy memories).


Education and support
It’s important for people with FTD, their family, and their carers to learn as much
as they can about it. For example, learning about the changes in someone’s behaviour
can help carers to prepare for and understand what is happening.

People with FTD need to be in an environment that’s as safe and free of risks as possible.
For example, as someone’s symptoms get worse, they become more likely to fall or stumble.

So you should be helped to do a check to make your home as safe and suitable as possible. This may look at things such as:



Tripping hazards


Room temperature, and


Noise and light levels.


You should also be given help with assessing if you are still able to drive, or to
use public transport safely, and with how well you can take care of yourself.

You should also be helped to learn how to communicate with people with FTD. As people’s symptoms get worse, clear and simple communication
becomes more important. So carers and families should be helped to learn to communicate
by:



Using short sentences


Making eye contact


Explaining things simply


Listening carefully and letting the person know you are listening, and


Staying calm when the person becomes frustrated.


People with FTD can sometimes become aggressive when frustrated or confused. So carers and families should be helped to understand
how to deal with this.

Long-term care and decisions
It is important to prepare for someone’s long-term care needs, and to make decisions
about the future before someone’s symptoms get worse to the point where that becomes
difficult.

This may include making decisions about how much extra help family members and carers need, and what will happen if someone can no longer be
cared for at home.

Drug treatments
Unfortunately there are very few medicines that can help with most symptoms of FTD.
In particular, drug treatments don’t help with cognitive problems like understanding,
memory, and thinking.

Your doctor may suggest medicines to help with specific symptoms, such as agitation,
aggression, or sleep problems. But they will probably be very cautious about doing
this.

This is because the medicines that can help with these problems can make some other
FTD symptoms worse. But if you, or someone you are caring for, are struggling with
specific symptoms, talk to your doctor about what you can do.

Your doctor should also make a list of all the medicines you are taking for any other conditions.

This is because some medicines can cause side effects that can make FTD worse, such as sleepiness, confusion, and agitation. So your doctor
will want to be aware of what may cause problems.

Valproate medicines and pregnancy
Younger women with FTD are sometimes prescribed valproate medicines to help with behavioural symptoms. This should only happen if there are no good alternatives.
Valproates can cause severe birth defects.

If you or someone you are caring for are prescribed valproates, your doctor must ensure that you have taken measures to prevent pregnancy. Your doctor may call this
a pregnancy prevention programme.

What to expect in the future
Unfortunately there are no treatments that can stop FTD from getting worse. And FTD
is always fatal. Most people live between about six and 12 years after being diagnosed.
But people who have FTD along with MND do not live as long as this.

Caring for someone with FTD can be very hard, no matter how much you love them. It can lead to problems such
as stress, depression, and even dependence on alcohol or drugs.

So getting as much help as you can is vital to caring for someone with FTD. Your doctor
may be able to help you find a support group near you. Or you can search online. You can talk to them about coping techniques,
and about anything else you want to know about caring for someone with FTD - and for
yourself."

If someone in your family has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease or another type
of dementia, you may want to ask their doctor some questions to find out more about
the disease.

Here are some questions that you might want to ask.


Why do you think my family member has dementia?


What is causing their dementia? Is it Alzheimer's disease or another type of dementia?




Could there be another reason for the symptoms?


Do they need to see a specialist?


Do they need to have any tests? If so, what kind of tests?


Will the symptoms get worse?


How will the symptoms change over time?


What can I expect in the future?


Will I be able to cope with caring for my family member at home?


Is there any help I can get?


Will my family member need to go into a nursing home?


If so, when will I need to arrange this?


Will there be regular, ongoing appointments?


What treatments can you give? How can they help?


Do these treatments have side effects?


Is anyone else in my family at risk of getting this type of dementia? If so, is there
anything they should be doing?"

This information tells you about an operation to put a device in your chest that helps
your heart beat normally.

It explains how the operation is done, how the device can help you, what the risks
are, and what to expect afterwards.

It’s your decision whether to have a defibrillator fitted. You can use our information
to help you discuss defibrillators with your doctor.

What is a defibrillator?
An implantable defibrillator is a device that's put (implanted) in your chest to stop an abnormal heart rhythm,
especially one where the lower part of your heart beats too quickly.

You might hear these devices called different things. For example, they’re sometimes
called implantable cardiac defibrillators or implantable cardioverter defibrillators. Either way, they're often called ICDs for short.

Normal and abnormal heart rates
A normal heart rate can be anything from 60 to 100 beats per minute. An abnormal heart rhythm can mean that your heart beats at 120 to 200 beats per minute, or even
faster. This can make your heart muscle flutter weakly instead of beating strongly.

If this happens, your heart can stop pumping blood around your body. If your heart
doesn’t start to beat normally again, you will die.

A controlled electric shock can get your heart beating normally again - a bit like
pressing a reset button in the heart. You might have seen this in medical dramas on
television, with actors using electric paddles to shock someone's heart into beating.

An ICD works in the same way as the paddles. It shocks your heart into beating steadily again
if it starts to beat too fast.

An ICD is about the size of a pack of cards. It's put under the skin just below your
collarbone on the left side of your chest. The device is powered by a battery and
has an electric circuit that checks your heartbeat. A lead connects the device to
your heart.

An abnormally fast heartbeat can be caused by several heart conditions. The information
here is only about people who have a heart condition called heart failure.

Heart failure is when your heart stops pumping properly because it's been damaged.
About one third of people with heart failure get a dangerously fast heartbeat. A fast
heartbeat increases the chance that someone with heart failure will die suddenly.

Why might I need a defibrillator?
If you have heart failure and an abnormal heart rhythm in the lower part of your heart,
an ICD can help you live longer.

Not everyone with heart failure will need an ICD. But your doctor might suggest one
if he or she thinks that there is a strong chance that you could die because of your
abnormal heart rhythm.

You should be offered an ICD if your heart stopped pumping because of a fast rhythm
and had to be restarted. But you should also be offered one if:



your heart beats too fast for long periods (more than 30 seconds)


your heart beats faster suddenly and without warning, and


you have blackouts or other signs that your blood flow is being restricted.


You should also be offered an ICD even if you don’t have blackouts and other serious
symptoms if:



your heart beats too fast for long periods, and


your heart struggles to pump out enough blood each time it beats, even if you don't
have very severe heart failure.



If you have very severe heart failure, your heart will be very weak and unable to
pump properly. Doctors don't usually recommend ICDs for people with very severe heart
failure, as they won’t help.

Some people with heart failure have an ICD fitted along with a pacemaker. A pacemaker is slightly different to an ICD. The type used in people with heart
failure uses an electrical pulse to keep both sides of the heart beating in time with
each other.

What will happen?
An operation to put an ICD in your chest usually takes between 45 minutes and an hour.
But you'll need to stay in hospital for a few days afterwards.

Before the operation
You'll have some tests before the surgery, including a blood test and an electrocardiogram
(ECG). An ECG records the electrical activity of your heart as a tracing on a graph.

Your doctor uses your test results to programme your ICD so that it can spot a heart
rhythm that is not normal for you.

If you take certain blood-thinning drugs for heart problems, you might need to stop
taking them a few days before the operation. These drugs increase the chance of excess
bleeding during surgery. Check this with your doctor.

If you're a man, you might have to cut or shave your chest hair before the operation.
You'll probably only need a local anaesthetic. This will numb your chest. You'll also
be given a drug called a sedative through a vein in the back of your hand to make
you calm and sleepy.

You won't see anything or feel any pain during surgery, but you might be aware of
what's going on around you. Operating theatres can be noisy, and you might hear the
sound of monitors checking your heart rate and blood pressure.

A nurse or the anaesthetist will talk to you to make sure you're OK.
During the operation
During surgery to implant a defibrillator:


the doctor will make a cut across your chest just below your collarbone. The cut will
be about 8 centimetres (3 inches) long



the ICD lead is threaded down through a vein into the lower right chamber of your
heart. Some ICDs have two or more leads. These go into other parts of your heart



the doctor takes X-rays of your chest to make sure the leads go in the right place


your doctor then makes a small pocket in the fat underneath the skin of your chest.
The ICD is placed in this pocket



your doctor will then connect the leads to the ICD and test it to make sure it works.
The ICD will gently shock your heart, but it shouldn't hurt



the cut on your skin is usually sewn up with one long stitch that dissolves later.
You might have a dressing over the wound.



You shouldn't feel any pain during the operation. Your cut may feel sore afterwards,
but you'll be given painkillers to help. If your painkillers don't work, you should
tell the nurse or doctor. You might be able to have a higher dose or a different painkiller.

How will the defibrillator work after the operation?
An ICD will only shock your heart if your heartbeat gets dangerously fast.
This shouldn’t happen often. Most people with defibrillators are shocked perhaps once
every year or two. Some people can have a defibrillator for several years without
it needing to shock their heart.

But if your defibrillator does need to shock you it can be very painful. It feels
like a big thump in your chest, and you might stumble.

If anyone is touching you when the shock happens it won't harm them, but they might
feel a tingle.

Some people say that they feel afraid and upset after a shock. Others say that they
feel relieved that the ICD saved their life.

After each shock you need to go to hospital to have your ICD checked and reset.
What are the risks?
All operations have risks, and your doctor should discuss with you the risks of surgery
to put in an ICD.

For example, anaesthetics can have side effects, although these are more likely with
a general anaesthetic. Some people have an allergic reaction to the anaesthetic or
have breathing or heart problems while under anaesthetic.

These problems are rare but serious when they do happen. If you have any allergies,
you must tell your doctor before the surgery.

The list of possible problems below might look long and scary. But remember, these
are problems that might happen, not things that will definitely happen. Many people
have no problems at all.

The main problems that can happen with ICD surgery are:



bleeding under the cut in your skin after the operation. If the blood builds up and
clots, it causes a large bruise called a haematoma. The area will be swollen and feel tender. You might need surgery to remove the blood
clot or to stop any bleeding



an infection around the wound. This can make your wound and the surrounding skin painful,
hot, and red. You’ll need to take antibiotics, and some people need to have their
ICD removed. But you can have another ICD fitted when the infection clears up



an infection that spreads to the heart. This is called endocarditis and it can be very serious. You'll need treatment with antibiotics



a lung puncture during the operation. If this happens, air can leak out of your lungs
and get trapped inside your chest. It can cause breathlessness and pain. You might
need to have a chest tube inserted to release the air



bruising on your chest. This can take a while to clear up


damage to the vein used to pass the leads into your heart. If this happens it will
need to be repaired



dying during surgery. This happens to less than 1 in 100 people who have this operation.


Even if your operation goes well, problems can happen with the ICD. Your doctor should
discuss these with you before the surgery.

Problems that can happen with an ICD include:



the leads breaking or slipping out of place. You might need a small operation to move
or replace the leads. Sometimes the ICD can slip out of place



ICDs sometimes not working properly, usually because of problems with the battery.
Your doctor should regularly check your ICD once it's fitted. Problems like this are
becoming less common as newer ICDs become more reliable



your ICD shocking your heart even though it's not beating dangerously. This can happen
if the ICD mistakes a harmless heart rhythm for a dangerous one. Or it could be that
the ICD is faulty or is set off accidentally by electrical equipment. As with battery
errors, these problems are becoming less common



security systems that use a magnetic force interfering with or even damaging your
ICD. And you can set the alarm off at airports and in shops



finding an ICD hard to live with, especially if shocks happen several times a year.
The shocks can save your life, but they are also upsetting. Shocks can cause anxiety
and depression in some people. Joining a support group for people with ICDs can help.



What can I expect afterwards?
Immediately after the operation
When you leave the operating theatre, you'll go to the recovery area until you're
fully awake. The area of your chest where the cut was made will feel numb for several
hours.

You'll probably feel sleepy at first, but you'll be able to get up and walk around
as soon as the sedative has worn off. Your ICD will be checked again before you leave
hospital.

Going home
You should be able to go home the day after your surgery. When you get home you're
likely to feel more tired than usual for a day or two.

Your chest might feel sore for a few days and it might look bruised and swollen. Painkillers
can help. It's a good idea to wear a loose top that doesn't rub your wound.

Your doctor or nurse will explain when and how to remove any dressings over your cut.
You'll also get advice on when you can go back to work.

It's best to avoid moving your shoulder and arm too much for a few days, and you should
avoid lifting anything heavy. You'll probably need a week or two to recover fully.

You might be able to feel the ICD under your skin. This can feel strange at first,
but most people quickly get used to it.

It can be harder to get used to the idea that a machine in your body can shock your
heart. Some people feel vulnerable and worry that the ICD might not work. But other
people feel reassured knowing that the ICD could save their life.

Ask at your hospital if there's a support group in your area for people with heart
failure or ICDs.

Some hospitals give people a card with technical information about their ICD. It is
important that you carry this with you when you go out in case you need medical treatment
in an emergency.

An ICD can't stop your heart failure from getting worse. Some people have their ICD
taken out when they become very ill because they don't want it to restart their weak
heart.

My ICD and everyday life
There are some areas of your life that will be affected by your ICD.
Driving
If you drive, you'll need to tell the driving authorities where you live that you
have an ICD. For example, in the UK it’s the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA).
You’ll also need to tell your insurance company.

The rules about driving vary from country to country and you should check the rules
where you live. But the rules in the UK are typical of those in many countries. In
the UK:



if you've had a fast heart beat before, then you won't be able to drive for six months
after your ICD is fitted



after this, you can drive only if your ICD has not shocked your heart for six months
and your doctor regularly checks that your ICD still works



you must stop driving for a month if your doctor reprograms your ICD.


Security systems
Security systems such as metal detectors at airports can trigger your ICD. It's safe
to go through them, but don't linger. It's best to tell security staff that you have
an ICD before you go through, as the security system will detect it.

Electrical equipment
Electrical equipment with magnets can affect your ICD. Large music systems and power
generators contain magnets. Talk to your doctor about what to avoid.

Household appliances such as televisions, washing machines, microwaves, radios, and
electric blankets won't interfere with your ICD.

Other medical treatments
Some medical treatments, such as radiotherapy, can damage your ICD. Whenever you have
medical treatment, tell the doctor treating you that you have an ICD. The ICD may need to be turned off during some
procedures.

You won't be able to have a type of scan called an MRI. This uses strong magnets that will damage your ICD.

Flying
You can travel by aeroplane if you have an ICD. But check your travel insurance, as
it might not cover your heart failure.

Activities and hobbies
It's safe to do things that increase your heart rate and make you out of breath. But
you need to warm up slowly so that your heart rate has time to adjust. Your hospital
should advise you about how much you can do.

You might want to avoid activities that could be dangerous if your ICD shocks your
heart, such as cliff walking or swimming alone.

You can have sex as soon as you feel able to. But avoid putting pressure on your arm
or chest for the first few weeks.

It's important that you know what to expect from your ICD and understand the risks
and benefits of having one. If you have any questions, ask your doctor or nurse."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1522175251306/Deep%20vein%20thrombosis,Deep vein thrombosis,"Deep vein thrombosis Last published: Aug 05, 2021
If you have deep vein thrombosis (DVT) it means a blood clot has formed in a blood
vessel. DVT can be dangerous if parts of the clot break off and travel to your lungs.
But there are treatments that can help prevent this. You can also do things to reduce
your chance of getting DVT again.
You can use our information to talk to your doctor about what treatments are best
for you.

What is deep vein thrombosis?
Veins are the blood vessels that carry blood back to your heart from all the parts
of your body. If a blood clot blocks a vein deep inside your body it's called deep
vein thrombosis. It happens most often in the veins in your legs.

Blood clots can happen below or above your knee. A clot above your knee is more serious.
What are the symptoms?
DVT can cause swelling and pain in the calf or thigh of one leg. The affected part of your leg may also feel hot
and turn red or purple. But most people who get DVT don't notice any symptoms.

If part of the blood clot breaks free it can travel through your blood vessels and
get stuck in your lungs. This is called a pulmonary embolism and it can be very dangerous.

Symptoms of a pulmonary embolism include:


breathlessness


chest pain


coughing up blood, and


a racing heartbeat


It's also possible to have a pulmonary embolism without any of these symptoms, but
this doesn't mean that it's not dangerous. Pulmonary embolism is more likely with
a DVT above the knee.

It’s very important to see your doctor if you think you might have a blood clot. You
may need tests, such as an ultrasound, x-ray, or lung scan. DVT may be caused by another
medical condition, so your doctor may suggest tests to find out what caused your DVT.

What treatments are available?
The main treatment for DVT is medicines that help treat blood clots by thinning the blood. Your doctor might also advise you to wear special elastic stockings to help with any pain or swelling caused by DVT.

Drugs treatments for deep vein thrombosis
The main treatments for DVT are medicines called anticoagulants. These drugs:



help prevent and break up blood clots


reduce the chance of pulmonary embolism, and


reduce the chance of DVT recurring.


There are many different anticoagulant drugs. So your doctor may have a choice of
drugs that he or she can recommend, depending on what might suit you best.

Some anticoagulants need to be given in hospital, either as injections or as an intravenous
(IV) drip. Or you might have your first treatment in hospital and then be taught how
to give yourself injections at home.

A typical course of treatment might be:


an injection or IV treatment in hospital, followed by


injections of anticoagulants for five to seven days, either at home or in hospital,
and



a course of anticoagulant tablets. You are likely to need to take them for at least
three months.



You might also need to have treatment in hospital if:


you have severe symptoms: for example, if you have pain as well as swelling in your
leg that shows up on an ultrasound scan



you are not able to give yourself injections


you have another medical condition that means you need to be monitored while you have
anticoagulant treatment: for example, if you've recently had a stroke, or if you have
liver disease.



Because anticoagulants help prevent your blood clotting they can sometimes cause unwanted bleeding. For example, you might bruise more easily, or have a nosebleed, or notice blood
in your urine or stools (poo).

If you have unusual bleeding you should tell your doctor straight away. Your doctor
may stop your treatment or give you other medicines to stop the bleeding.

If you take a course of pills of an anticoagulant called warfarin, your doctor should advise you about some things to bear in mind.

For example, the effect of warfarin on your blood can be affected by any other medicines
you're taking, and by some foods, and by the amount of alcohol you drink. You’ll also
need regular blood tests to check that you’re taking the right dose of warfarin.

Warfarin used to be commonly used for DVT. But it has mostly been replaced by newer
drugs.

Pregnant women should not take warfarin. If you're pregnant and have DVT you'll probably be treated
with an anticoagulant drug called heparin. If you are planning to breastfeed your baby there is a type of heparin that is safe
to use while breastfeeding.

Elastic compression stockings
Following DVT, some people get swelling, sores on their skin, or damage to the tissue
around the blocked vein. This is called post-phlebitic syndrome. Wearing special compression stockings may help prevent these problems.

You wear them during the day but you can take them off while you sleep, because you
don't need them when you're lying down. You can buy them at a pharmacy. It's important
to get them properly fitted to suit the size of your legs.

Exercise
Doctors recommend walking as a good type of exercise for people with DVT. Walking
can help reduce DVT symptoms and problems caused by post-phlebitic syndrome.

Deep vein thrombosis and travel
Some research has found that long-distance travel, especially air travel, increases
your chance of DVT. If you think you might be at risk, talk to your doctor. You might
need to take medicines or wear compression stockings when you travel.

Some doctors advise not drinking a lot of alcohol and not taking sleeping tablets
during long journeys. They also say you should try to exercise your legs by stretching
them as you sit or by walking around as much as you can.

What to expect in the future
What will happen depends partly on where the DVT happens in your body. Blood clots
in the veins in your thigh are more dangerous than clots below your knee. If you have
DVT below your knee you may need more tests after about one week to make sure the
DVT hasn't travelled above your knee.

DVT can come back in some people. If this happens to you, you will need more treatment."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1203678764268/Dandruff,Dandruff,"Dandruff Last published: Nov 23, 2021
Most people get dandruff from time to time. More severe dandruff seems to be linked
to yeasts that grow on your scalp. Most anti-dandruff shampoos work by killing these
yeasts or stopping them growing.

You can use our information to talk to your doctor or pharmacist and decide which
treatments are best for you.

What is dandruff?
Dandruff is flaky skin on your scalp. Some dandruff is normal, because the top layer
of your skin flakes away naturally over time. But dandruff is sometimes caused by
a medical condition called seborrhoeic dermatitis.

Seborrhoeic dermatitis is a skin condition that causes flaky or inflamed skin. It
seems to be linked to yeasts that grow on oily parts of your body, like your scalp
or around your nose.

Yeasts are a type of fungus. When seborrhoeic dermatitis affects your scalp, it can cause large flakes of skin.
In young children, this is called 'cradle cap'. Here, we look only at dandruff caused
by seborrhoeic dermatitis in adults.

What are the symptoms?
Flakes of dandruff caused by seborrhoeic dermatitis tend to be oily, and they may
be a white or yellowish colour. You may also get itchy or inflamed skin that looks
a bit like a sunburn.

What treatments are available?
Lots of shampoos are available to help with dandruff. Just washing your hair will
help to remove flakes, but anti-dandruff shampoos also contain chemicals to control
yeasts or reduce inflammation on your scalp.

Most of these treatments are available over the counter. However, some require a prescription
from a doctor, particularly at higher strengths.

Try to avoid getting anti-dandruff shampoos in your eyes, and rinse well with water
if you do.

Shampoos you can buy yourself
Well-known brands of anti-danruff shampoo display the names of the active ingredients
clearly on the labels, so it's easy enough to check whether they contain the treatments
listed below.

Most people start off by trying a commonly available anti-dandruff shampoo, such as
one that contains  pyrithione zinc.

Other common anti-dandruff shampoos contain coal tar. Some people don't like the smell of tar shampoos, but many products are perfumed
to try to reduce this problem.

You could also try a shampoo that contains salicylic acid. Salicylic acid is a chemical that helps to break down hard or scaly skin.

For more severe dandruff, you can try a shampoo containing ketoconazole. Ketoconazole is a drug that kills fungi, including yeasts.

Some people find that ketoconazole irritates their scalp. This is more likely if you've
recently used a corticosteroid treatment on your skin (see below).

Another treatment that's used for more severe dandruff is selenium sulfide. This is a chemical that helps to kill funguses.

Side effects don't seem to be common with selenium shampoos. But a few people get
skin irritation. And some people find that the shampoo bleaches their hair slightly
or turns their scalp an orange colour.

Other treatments for dandruff include shampoos containing either ciclopirox or miconazole.

Treatments you can get from a doctor
If you have dandruff caused by severe dermatitis of the scalp, and other treatments
haven't helped, your doctor may suggest using a corticosteroid shampoo or lotion. One treatment that comes as a lotion or shampoo is betamethasone.

Corticosteroids can have side effects, but using a corticosteroid shampoo for a short
time shouldn't cause serious problems. Possible side effects include thinning of your
skin or slight changes of skin colour.

What to expect in the future
Treatment can help get rid of dandruff, but it often comes back. You may need to use
your anti-dandruff shampoo again from time to time. You may also be able to use your

Cytomegalovirus is a common virus that is usually harmless. But it can cause serious
problems if pregnant women pass it on to their unborn babies. It can also be more
serious for people with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV.

The symptoms of CMV are a bit like flu or like having swollen glands. If you have
a flu-like illness while pregnant, it's important that you see your doctor.

What is cytomegalovirus?
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a virus that is carried by most people and usually causes
no symptoms or signs of illness. After the virus infects you, it usually just stays
in your body without causing any problems.

From time to time the virus might flare up and become 'active'. But if you have a
healthy immune system you will only have a mild illness that's a bit like flu, or
you might not become ill at all.

Because CMV is usually harmless, and because it spreads so easily, trying to avoid
it is pointless. For example, it can be spread by:



close physical contact, kissing, and sex


blood transfusions


organ and cell transplants, and


from mother to baby in the womb.


CMV in pregnancy
One group of people who should try to avoid catching CMV is pregnant women. This might
sound strange, as most people, including pregnant women, will already have CMV.

But if you catch a new strain of CMV, it's likely to be what's called an 'active strain',
which can cause illness. This often happens when pregnant women catch CMV from another
young child.

CMV that is passed on to a baby in the womb is called congenital CMV.
Pregnant women are advised to:


practise good hygiene, especially around small children. For example, you should wash
your hands thoroughly after changing nappies, and



see your doctor straight away if you have an infection or flu-like illness while pregnant.


But CMV spreads easily, so it's not always possible to avoid it, despite your best
efforts. So if you get symptoms of flu, a sore throat, or swollen glands while pregnant,
see your doctor.

Your doctor can't treat you while you're pregnant. But he or she can monitor your
baby. If your baby has CMV your doctor can then treat him or her soon after birth.
The earlier a baby is treated, the better the outcome.

The most common problem that CMV causes in babies infected in the womb is hearing
loss. CMV is one of the most common causes of hearing loss in children.

But it can also cause harm in other ways, including problems with nerve and brain
development, and mental disability.

Between 10 and 20 in 100 babies infected with CMV in the womb will have some problems.
And about half of these babies will have lifelong problems, usually including hearing
loss.

CMV in people with weakened immune systems
If you have a weakened immune system, CMV can cause serious harm, including problems
with your blood cells and major organs, and problems with the eyes that can sometimes
lead to blindness.

CMV can be a particular problem for people with HIV, or for those who have had an
organ transplant, or a cell transplant (for example, bone marrow).

People taking antiretroviral treatment (ART) for HIV should be told by their doctor
to look out for the symptoms of CMV (and any other infection) so that they can get
treatment straight away.

And people who have had a transplant of any kind will be carefully watched for any
problems.

What are the symptoms?
In people with a healthy immune system, CMV doesn't usually cause any symptoms. If
you do have symptoms, they will usually be similar to those of a flu-like illness
or mild glandular fever, such as:



fever


sore throat


swollen glands, and


feeling weak and tired.


These symptoms will clear up by themselves just as if you had flu or a cold.
In people with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV, the symptoms also
start with a fever, but the effects can be much more serious.

What treatments work?
If you have a healthy immune system, a first infection with CMV or an occasional flare-up
is not serious, and you don't need treatment. You just need to take care of yourself
as you would with any infection. You won't even know that it's CMV.

In people who need treatment, such as those with weakened immune systems, the treatment
for CMV is antiviral medicines.

Treatment for newborn babies
There is no treatment for pregnant women with CMV. But you should see your doctor
if you have symptoms. Your doctor can then check if the infection has been passed
on to your baby.

Your doctor can then monitor your baby's progress. Most babies that are infected with
CMV in the womb are born healthy.

Newborn babies with CMV symptoms can be given antiviral medicines. These medicines
don't get rid of the virus completely, but they weaken the virus so that they can
reduce the harm it causes.

If your baby needs treatment for CMV, he or she will need to stay in hospital for
as long as the treatment lasts.

What will happen?
If you have CMV because of a weakened immune system, your doctor will monitor you
regularly to check how you are doing, and to make sure that you are getting the right
treatment to help you avoid serious problems.

Your doctor will also want to look out for problems that can sometimes be caused by
the side effects of antiviral medicines. These can include problems with blood cell
production and liver damage.

If you are pregnant and have CMV your doctor will monitor your baby's progress carefully.
This will probably mean having tests and scans.

If you are pregnant, the most important thing you can do about CMV is simply to be
aware of it. If you become ill with a fever and flu-like symptoms, see your doctor
straight away."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1547791290699/Cystitis,Cystitis,"Cystitis Last published: Jul 10, 2020
If you get a burning pain when you pass urine, you might have cystitis. Cystitis can
clear up on its own in a few days. But many people need treatment. If you get a lot
of infections, your doctor may recommend treatments to prevent them.

What happens?
Cystitis happens when germs (bacteria) grow in your bladder. This causes inflammation.
Both men and women can get cystitis. But cystitis is rare in men. This information
is about cystitis in women and what to do about frequent infections.

Urine doesn't usually contain enough bacteria to cause infections. But sometimes bacteria
from around your anus can spread to your urethra (the tube that carries urine from
your bladder to outside your body).

From here, the bacteria can travel to your bladder and cause an infection.
Having sex is a common cause of cystitis. Other things that can make it more likely
include:



using a vaginal spermicide cream or gel


having diabetes


having a tube to drain urine from your bladder (this is called a catheter)


being older


reaching the menopause


being pregnant.


Some women get cystitis again and again. If it happens more than three times a year,
doctors call this recurrent cystitis.

What are the symptoms?
The main symptoms of cystitis are:


a burning pain when you pass urine, and


feeling the need to pass urine often.


You might also have:


urine that's cloudy and smells bad


blood in your urine, and


pain in your abdomen.


If your symptoms are very bad, or get worse, you should see your doctor.
Your doctor or nurse can test your urine for infection, to check whether you have
cystitis. You may need further urine tests if your doctor wants to know which bacteria
are causing your infection.

Sometimes cystitis can spread to your kidneys. This can be more serious.
You should see a doctor straight away if you have signs of a kidney infection. These
include:



fever


pain in your side


nausea, and


vomiting.


What treatments work?
Cystitis often goes away on its own in about three days. But if your symptoms don't
clear up in a few days, or if they are severe, you should see a doctor.

Your doctor will probably prescribe antibiotic tablets to clear the infection. You
should take them exactly as your doctor prescribes, until you finish the course.

There are also things that you can do to help prevent another attack. If you get frequent
infections, there are medicines that may help.

What to do during an attack
Some doctors recommend that you should drink more fluids (preferably water), to try
to 'flush out' the bacteria. But it may be best to avoid acidic drinks like fruit
juice, and drinks that may irritate your bladder, like coffee.

You can take paracetamol to relieve your pain. Holding a hot water bottle over your
abdomen may be comforting.

Things you can do yourself to prevent more attacks
You might have heard that drinking cranberry juice or taking cranberry capsules can
help prevent cystitis. There isn't enough evidence to say for sure whether it will
work. But it won't do you any harm in moderate amounts.

Many women say that passing urine straight after sex stops them getting cystitis.
If you get recurrent cystitis your doctor might recommend that you take regular antibiotics, either daily, or after
you have sex.

If you get cystitis when pregnant, you can still have antibiotics, but they will be different ones than for women who
are not pregnant. This is because some antibiotics are not safe to take during pregnancy.

What will happen to me?
Cystitis can clear up by itself in about three days without any treatment. But if
it doesn't, taking antibiotics for a few days will probably work.

If you have more than two infections a year for a few years in a row, you’ll probably
keep getting infections unless you have treatment."

Cystic fibrosis is a genetic (inherited) condition that is present from birth. It
affects the lungs and digestive system. Treatments can help ease the symptoms and
prevent complications but the condition usually gets worse as people get older. There
is no cure and people with cystic fibrosis have a reduced life expectancy.
What treatments work?
Cystic fibrosis (CF) affects the lungs and digestive system by causing them to become
clogged with thick mucus so that they can’t work properly. For more background information,
see our leaflet Cystic fibrosis: what is it?

There is no cure for CF. Instead, the aims of treatment are to ease the condition
as much as possible by:



doing as much as possible to prevent common health problems linked to CF


dealing with the complications of CF, such as issues with nutrition, and lung problems.


Treatments for lung problems
Lung problems are the most common cause of difficulty for people with CF. If the lungs
become badly congested (clogged) there are several ways of helping to clear them,
including physical treatments and drug treatments.

Physical treatments include:



manual physiotherapy. This involves a physiotherapist helping you get into positions
where mucus can drain from the lungs more easily, then gently tapping parts of the
body to loosen the mucus



special breathing exercises


'vest' therapy. You wear a special inflatable vest that vibrates gently to loosen
mucus



a flutter valve, which is a small breathing device that makes the lungs vibrate to
loosen mucus. You use it whenever you need to



a positive expiratory pressure (PEP) mask or mouthpiece. The device makes you work
harder to breathe out, which helps loosen mucus.



Drug treatments that you breathe in through an inhaler include:



mucolytics. These are drugs that loosen mucus


bronchodilators. These are drugs that help open up your airways


antibiotics. Your doctor might suggest these if you have a long-term chest infection




corticosteroids (steroids for short). These are drugs that relieve inflammation (swelling)
in the lungs. These tend to be used in people who have asthma as well as CF.



Oral drug treatments (tablets and medicines that you swallow) include:



corticosteroids. As with the inhaled version, these are often only recommended for
people with other chest problems such as asthma



antibiotics to help prevent chest infections


anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen.


Newer drugs called CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators are intended
to treat the underlying causes of CF rather than the symptoms. But they are not available
everywhere and they only work for people with certain gene problems.

A lung transplant operation might be an option for some people if all other treatments don’t work well
enough. But it can take a long time for suitable lungs to become available, if they
become available at all.

Lung transplants are also not safe for people with CF who have certain other health
problems such as multiple organ problems, and severe gastro-oesophageal reflux.

Treatments for nutrition problems
People with CF need to take supplements that contain:


vitamins that they can’t absorb well enough from food, and


enzymes that help them to absorb nutrition from food.


You take these supplements before meals. A nutritionist will explain when and how
to take them, and how much you need at different times.

Treatments for intestine (gut) blockages
People with CF can have various digestive problems, including diarrhoea and gastro-oesophageal
reflux. But the intestine can also sometimes become partially blocked with mucus.
This is treated with enemas.

After an episode of intestinal blockage some people may need to take medicines for
a while, such as laxatives, or medicines that soften the stool. This can help stop
the problem happening again.

If your intestine becomes completely blocked you may need to have surgery to remove
the blockage. But this is rare.

Other problems
Some people with CF also need to take medicines to help with gastro-oesophageal reflux.
And about 1 in 3 people with CF also develop liver disease and need to take medicine
to treat it. Some people with CF will develop advanced liver disease, which can be
fatal.

What will happen?
CF is a serious condition that shortens people’s lives. There is no cure. But the
outlook is changing.

A few decades ago most people with CF died in childhood. Most people with CF now live
into their late 30s, and many live much longer. And advances in treatments are still
being made.

The ongoing care of people with CF is also improving. If you have CF you should be
seen in a specialist centre every 3 months, or more often depending on your health.
You can discuss how you are doing with a doctor and nutritionist and have tests to
check if you are getting the right nutrition and how well your lungs are working.


One thing that has been shown to help people with CF stay healthier and live longer
is regular exercise. Exercise helps keep the lungs working well. You can talk with
your doctor about what type and how much exercise you (or your child) should do. But
staying as active as possible is a good rule of thumb.

There are various charities and support groups to help people with CF and the parents
of children with the condition. You should be able to find them easily online. For
example, in the UK, the Cystic Fibrosis Trust (cysticfibrosis.org.uk) provides information
and help with many aspects of the condition."

What is cystic fibrosis?
Cystic fibrosis (CF) affects the lungs and digestive system by causing them to become
clogged with thick mucus so that they can’t work properly.

The congestion in the lungs leads to chest infections and shortness of breath, while
the mucus in the digestive organs makes it harder to digest food normally. This means
that people with CF often have problems getting enough nutrition from their food.


These problems gradually get worse as people age. People with CF tend to die earlier
than most people, usually because of lung problems.

CF is rare. It affects about 1 in every 3000 people. You can only get it if both your
parents carry a specific faulty gene. And even then there’s only a one in four chance
that you will have the condition.

For information on treatments for CF, see our leaflet Cystic fibrosis: what treatments work?
What are the symptoms?
These days many countries screen newborn babies for CF. So if someone has CF it’s
usually detected at that point. The screening involves a heel-prick blood test.

If this test suggests that your baby might have CF, he or she will need further tests,
including a sweat test. Testing your baby’s sweat can show whether they have the condition.


The symptoms usually appear when your child is between one and three years old. But
they can start earlier, when your child is still a baby, or later in childhood. Sometimes
they don’t really appear until adulthood.

Symptoms of CF include:


failure to 'thrive' as a baby or young child. This means that the child doesn’t seem
to grow at what’s considered the usual rate



a wet-sounding cough


shortness of breath


being prone to chest infections


long-term sinus problems


an unusually large appetite.



As well as an unusually large appetite, people with CF can also have other digestive
symptoms, such as diarrhoea, and very smelly stools that float because they contain
a lot of fat that their digestive system can’t absorb.

'Clubbing' of the fingers and toes is also common in people with CF. This means that
the tops of the fingernails and toenails are very rounded in shape instead of fairly
flat.

If your child hasn’t been diagnosed through screening at birth, and your doctor suspects
CF, he or she will ask you about:



what country your child was born in. This is to find out whether he or she was likely
to have been screened at birth



any family history of the condition


whether your child has recurrent chest problems


any digestive problems, such as diarrhoea, an unusually large appetite, or gastro-oesophageal
reflux ('acid' reflux or heartburn).



Your doctor will also do a sweat test. If the result of this test isn’t clear, and
your doctor still suspects CF, he or she might suggest genetic testing.

What will happen?
CF is a serious condition that shortens people’s lives. There is no cure. But the
outlook is changing.

A few decades ago most people with CF died in childhood. Most people with CF now live
into their late 30s, and many live much longer. And advances in treatments are still

Cushing’s syndrome is caused by high levels of a hormone called cortisol. It often
results from long-term treatment with drugs called corticosteroids. Most people recover
well when this is dealt with.

What is it?
Cushing’s syndrome is caused by high levels of a hormone called cortisol. The medical term for this is hypercortisolism. The main symptom of Cushing’s syndrome
is weight gain. The condition is more common in women than in men.

The most common cause of Cushing’s syndrome is long-term treatment with drugs called
corticosteroids. Doctors often refer to them as just ‘steroids’ for short.

Corticosteroids are used to treat pain and inflammation (swelling). They are used
for many medical conditions, including arthritis (which causes swollen joints) and
asthma (which causes swelling in parts of the lungs).

While they are effective treatments for many people, corticosteroids can cause problems
in some people who take them for many months or years. These problems include diabetes
and Cushing’s syndrome.

Cushing’s syndrome can be serious. This is usually because the weight gain that happens
with the condition increases the chances of serious problems affecting the heart and
blood vessels (cardiovascular disease). Cushing’s syndrome can also lead to diabetes,
high blood pressure, and weaker bones.

A less common cause of Cushing's syndrome is when the high level of cortisol is caused
by an internal problem, such as a tumour. For more information see our information
on Cushing’s syndrome caused by an internal problem.

What are the symptoms?
One main symptom of Cushing’s syndrome is weight gain, especially around the middle,
the upper back, between the shoulder blades, and in the face. Other symptoms that
sometimes go along with the weight gain can include:



Stretch marks on the skin


Skin that is thin and bruises easily


Long healing times for broken skin (such as with cuts, grazes, and insect bites)


Extreme tiredness


Muscle weakness.


The symptoms can also affect men and women differently. For example, if you are a
woman you might notice:



Increased body hair or facial hair


Changes in your menstrual periods: for example, your periods may become irregular,
or might stop completely.



If you are a man you might notice that:


You are less interested in sex


You find it more difficult to get an erection.


But having some or even all of these symptoms doesn’t always mean that someone has
Cushing’s syndrome. So your doctor will ask you questions about your medical history,
and especially about whether you have ever taken corticosteroids, and for how long.


If you are not taking corticosteroids your doctor will also want to do some tests.
These might include testing your saliva or your urine for high levels of cortisol.
If the results suggest that you might have Cushing’s syndrome your doctor might refer
you to a specialist (called an endocrinologist) for more tests to make sure.

What treatments work?
Reducing your steroid dose
The main treatment for Cushing’s syndrome is to slowly reduce the amount of steroid
medication you take to the lowest possible dose that treats the condition that you
are taking the medications for.

But you only do this under your doctor’s supervision. Don’t make any changes to the
way you take your medications without talking to your doctor. This is because it is
dangerous to stop taking corticosteroids suddenly or to reduce your dose too quickly.


Some people get side effects when they reduce their steroid dose, such as diarrhoea,
vomiting, and fatigue (tiredness). If you have side effects while reducing your steroid
dose, talk to your doctor straight away.

What will happen?
Addressing the problem by working with your doctor to reduce your steroid dose works
very well for most people. For example, as cortisol levels return to normal, most
people lose most or all of the weight that they have put on. This greatly reduces
the chance of heart disease and diabetes.

Your bones should also become stronger, meaning that you are less likely to have fractures,
and your blood pressure should return to a healthier level.

In people with diabetes, treatment can also lead to better diabetes control. If your
diabetes was caused by steroid treatment, treatment may even lead to diabetes being
cured altogether."

Cushing’s syndrome is caused by high levels of a hormone called cortisol. This can
be caused by a tumour on one of your glands. The usual treatment is surgery to remove
the tumour. Most people improve or recover with treatment.

What is it?
Cushing’s syndrome is caused by high levels of a hormone called cortisol. The medical term for this is hypercortisolism. It can happen if you have a tumour
that affects a gland in your body called the pituitary gland or, rarely, your adrenal glands. The main symptom of Cushing’s syndrome is weight gain.

A common cause of Cushing’s syndrome is long-term treatment with medications called
corticosteroids. To find out more see our information on Cushing’s syndrome caused by medication.

The pituitary gland is a pea-sized gland that is found at the base of the brain. Your
adrenal glands are in the middle of your lower back, just above your kidneys.

When these glands are working normally they regulate your body’s production of certain
hormones, including cortisol. But if either the pituitary gland or one or both of
the adrenal glands are affected by a tumour they can produce too little or too much
of some hormones. These tumours are usually not cancer.

Cushing’s syndrome can be serious. This is usually because the weight gain that happens
with the condition increases the chances of serious problems affecting the heart and
blood vessels (cardiovascular disease).

What are the symptoms?
One main symptom of Cushing’s syndrome is weight gain, especially around the middle,
the upper back, between the shoulder blades, and in the face. Other symptoms that
sometimes go along with the weight gain can include:



Stretch marks on the skin


Skin that is thin and bruises easily


Long healing times for broken skin (such as with cuts, grazes, and insect bites)


Extreme tiredness


Muscle weakness.


The symptoms can also affect men and women differently. For example, if you are a
woman you might notice:



Increased body hair or facial hair


Changes in your menstrual periods: for example, your periods may become irregular,
or might stop completely.



If you are a man you might notice that:


You are less interested in sex


You find it more difficult to get an erection.


Your doctor will also want to do some tests. These might include testing your saliva
or your urine for high levels of cortisol. If the results suggest that you might have
Cushing’s syndrome your doctor might refer you to a specialist (called an endocrinologist)
for more tests to make sure.

If your doctor thinks that you may have high levels of cortisol caused by a tumour
you will need to have a scan to check.

What treatments work?
The treatment you are offered will depend on which of your glands is affected, the
pituitary or the adrenal.

Cushing's syndrome caused by a tumour on the pituitary gland
Most people need surgery to remove the tumour. You can talk with your doctor about whether surgery is the
right option for you.

This operation works well for most people but it doesn’t help everyone. And, even
if the operation works in the short term, some people need a second operation a few
years later. The operation is more likely to be successful if your tumour is small.


Your surgeon will try not to damage the pituitary gland itself when removing the tumour.
But this is not always possible, especially if the tumour is large.

If you need to have a large part of your pituitary gland removed it will no longer
be able to produce the important hormones that it used to. So you may need to take
these hormones as tablets or injections after your operation.

As well as surgery you might be offered medication to reduce the effects that cortisol is having in your body.

If medications and surgery don’t help you enough, or if you have a tumour that can’t
be operated on, your doctor might suggest radiotherapy. Radiotherapy is a type of x-ray treatment that can be used to shrink the tumour.


If you have this treatment you might need to have several sessions over a number of
weeks. This reduces the chance that the treatment will cause harm to your brain.

Radiotherapy can be an effective treatment for Cushing’s syndrome, but it tends to
take effect slowly. So it may be a few months before you notice improvements in your
symptoms.

Cushing's syndrome caused by a tumour on the adrenal gland
The usual treatment for this type of Cushing’s syndrome is surgery to remove the tumour.
To do this, the surgeon also needs to remove the adrenal gland itself. Removing the
affected adrenal gland cures your Cushing’s syndrome.

In some cases both adrenal glands need to be removed. If this happens you will need
to take hormone treatments to replace the hormones that are no longer produced by
the adrenal glands.

Some people choose not to have this operation. If you don’t wish to have this surgery
you may be able to take medications that reduce the effects of cortisol instead. But
this is not as effective as surgery.

What will happen?
Without treatment, about half of people with Cushing’s syndrome caused by a pituitary
tumour will die within five years, usually because of cardiovascular disease.

But treatment for Cushing’s syndrome works very well for most people. For example,
as cortisol levels return to normal, most people lose most or all of the weight that
they have put on. This greatly reduces the chance of heart disease and diabetes.

Your bones should also become stronger, meaning that you are less likely to have fractures,
and your blood pressure should return to a healthier level."

Crohn's disease is a long-term condition that causes patches of inflammation on the
wall of your gut. This can lead to uncomfortable symptoms like stomach pain and diarrhoea.


To read more about what happens in Crohn's disease, see the leaflet Crohn's disease: what is it?
The treatment you need will depend on what part of your gut is affected and how severe
the disease is. Some people just need regular check-ups, while some people will need
surgery at some point.

Tailored treatment
Crohn's disease is a complex condition that can affect any part of the digestive system.
No one's symptoms are exactly like anyone else's.

This means that your treatment needs to be tailored to what works best for you.
Once diagnosed, you should be seen by a specialist, and the decisions about your treatment
should involve you.

Treatment goals
The aim of treatment for Crohn's disease is to achieve what's called remission. This means that you don't have symptoms any more.

This isn't always possible, and some people have what are called flare-ups of symptoms. But you and your doctor should be able to find treatments that help
relieve or stop your symptoms for much of the time.

The treatments you are offered will depend on several things, including:


your age


your experiences with any previous treatments you have tried


which parts of your digestive system are affected, and


your own preferences.



Treating pain and stomach problems
The main treatments for Crohn's are aimed at trying to reduce the inflammation (swelling)
that causes your symptoms. But your doctor will probably suggest medications to help
with these symptoms in the short term, or as they occur.

For example, most people with Crohn's get stomach cramps. Your doctor might suggest
drugs called anti-spasmodics to help with these.

Your doctor might also recommend medications to help with pain and diarrhoea.
But you should talk to your doctor before taking anything for these symptoms, as they
might not be suitable to take with other medications that you might need.

Treatments for mild symptoms
One widely used treatment for mild Crohn's is a type of medication called corticosteroids, often just called steroids for short.

Corticosteroids are similar to chemicals that your body makes naturally to help reduce
inflammation.

These drugs can cause side effects, including fragile bones and thinning of the skin.
So doctors usually suggest that you only take them for short periods. But this might
be enough to make a big difference to your symptoms.

Diet
As with any illness that affects your digestive system, you might find that that cutting
out certain foods helps relieve your symptoms.

There is plenty of dietary advice online for people with Crohn's. But it's not certain
how well it works. And there isn't one special diet that will help everyone with Crohn's.
So a good approach is to:



eat as healthily as you can, and


listen to what your own body is telling you about how different foods affect you.
For example, you might find it helpful to keep a food diary.



Treatments for more severe symptoms
Several medications have been shown to help people with moderate or severe symptoms
of Crohn's disease. These include:



corticosteroids, to reduce inflammation



immunomodulators. It's thought that, in people with Crohn's, the immune system can attack the digestive
system by over-reacting to an infection. These drugs can help to calm down your immune
system and relieve your symptoms



biological medications. These drugs are another way of reducing inflammation. They are usually given as
an infusion (drip) into a vein every few months.



Depending on your symptoms, your doctor might suggest a combination of several types
of medication. And he or she should check on you regularly to see how well your treatment
is working, and whether changing it might help.

All of the medications that can help people with Crohn's can have side effects in some people. For example, immunomodulators and biological drugs can reduce your
body's ability to fight off infections.

Your doctor should discuss the side effects of these treatments with you before you
decide to have any of them.

Surgery
If the inflammation in your bowel becomes severe, you might need surgery to treat
complications, such as a blockage in your bowel, or to repair a hole in your bowel.

Inflammation can cause a narrow tunnel to gradually form between two parts of your
body, such as your bowel and bladder. This is called a fistula.

Surgery can also be used to remove a damaged section of your bowel.
Your doctor should discuss with you the possible need for surgery, as well as how
it might help you, and the possible complications and risks."

Crohn's disease is a long-term condition that affects your gut. It can cause problems
anywhere from your mouth to your anus (back passage). People with Crohn's disease
often get diarrhoea and pain around their abdomen.

The condition can cause serious problems. Medications can help to control Crohn's
disease, but many people need to have surgery at some point.

What is Crohn's disease?
If you have Crohn's disease, you get patches of inflammation (swelling) on the wall
of your gut. This can cause uncomfortable symptoms such as stomach pain. Inflammation
can also block the flow of food through your gut.

Crohn's disease can be difficult to live with and hard to predict. There might be
times when your symptoms get worse, and times when you don't get any symptoms at all.

Doctors aren't sure what causes Crohn's disease. It might be partly down to your genes.
Inflammation in your bowel can cause serious problems if it becomes severe. You might
get a blockage, or a hole in the wall of your bowel (called a perforation) These problems need urgent treatment.

A blocked bowel can cause:



pain


bloating


constipation, and


vomiting.


A hole in your bowel can:


cause severe pain


give you a fever, and


make you feel generally very unwell.


What are the symptoms?
Symptoms of Crohn's disease include:


bouts of diarrhoea (loose stools)


losing weight without trying


cramps or pain. Pain often affects the area around the belly button, or the lower
right part of your belly



bleeding in your bowel. You might notice bright red blood in your stools, or it might
be almost black. You might see mucus or pus in the stool. If the bleeding lasts a
long time, you can become anaemic. This means your blood cannot carry oxygen around the body efficiently. Anaemia can
make you feel very tired.



Diagnosing Crohn's disease
Diagnosing Crohn's disease can be difficult. The symptoms vary from person to person,
and some of the symptoms are the same as those caused by other illnesses.

You might need several tests, including:


blood tests


stool tests


radiological tests or scans, and


a colonoscopy, which is the only way to be sure you have Crohn's. This involves putting a tiny
camera on the end of a flexible tube into your bowel, through your anus (back passage).



What will happen to me?
There is no cure for Crohn's disease, but there are treatments that can help. To learn
more, see our leaflet Crohn's disease: what treatments work?

Many people with Crohn's disease need surgery at some point. But it might be many years before you need surgery, and some people
never need it.

Crohn's disease tends to improve for people who stop smoking. If you smoke, it's a good idea to stop.

You will need check-ups with your doctor every few months. You may also have tests
every so often to check for more serious illnesses, such as bowel cancer.

You should talk to your doctor whenever your symptoms get worse. There may be times
when you need urgent medical help.

See a doctor as soon as you can if you:


have a fever


have severe pain


have blood in your stools


have bloating


feel dizzy, or


feel dehydrated.


It's also important to get help quickly if you:



can't go to the toilet


can't stop being sick, or


have fluid leaking from your anus or from anywhere on your skin."

If you've been diagnosed with Crohn's disease, you may want to talk to your doctor
to find out more.

Here are some questions you might want to ask:


How do you know I have Crohn's disease?


Where can I find out more about Crohn's?


Is there a support group in my area?


Are there online support groups you'd recommend?


Should I change my diet? Are there any foods I should avoid?


Can I see a dietitian?


Do I need to take vitamin tablets or other supplements?


Is it a good idea to use over-the-counter treatments for pain or diarrhoea?


Is there a choice of drug treatment for a flare-up?


What do I do if my treatment doesn't work?


Can I change drug treatments if I'm getting side effects?


Is it worth taking treatment regularly, to prevent flare-ups?


How will having Crohn's affect my ability to work?


Will I need to change my lifestyle?


Can you help me to stop smoking?


When is surgery used to treat Crohn's disease?


Will I need tests to make sure I don't have bowel cancer?"

This leaflet is about the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak that began in China in late
2019. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the outbreak a pandemic. This
means that it has spread across the world.

This virus can cause a severe lung infection, and it can cause death. You can use
our information to talk with your doctor if you are concerned about COVID-19.

What is COVID-19?
COVID-19 is a disease caused by a type of virus called a coronavirus. This is a common
type of virus that affects both animals and humans. Coronaviruses often cause symptoms
like those of the common cold. But sometimes they can cause more serious infections.


The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is a new type of coronavirus. Most of the first
people affected had links to a seafood and live animal market in Wuhan City, Hubei
Province, China. This suggests that this new coronavirus might be a combination of
human and animal coronaviruses.

The virus has now spread around the world. The US, India, Brazil, France, and Germany
are among the countries with the most confirmed cases. The US, Brazil, India, Russia,
and Mexico are among the countries with the most deaths.

How do people catch COVID-19?
COVID-19 is able to spread from person to person, usually through the air. The virus
spreads most easily when people cough or sneeze. It can also spread when people touch
objects and surfaces that have the virus on them.

The virus can survive for up to 24 hours on cardboard and for up to three days on
stainless steel and plastic. Infected people can spread this virus even if they don't
have any symptoms yet.

You are more likely to get the infection if:


you have been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19


you are having treatment for cancer


you are older


you are male


you are obese (very overweight)


you have chronic kidney disease.


Research in some countries, including the UK and US, has found that people of black
and Asian origin are more likely than white people to become infected and to have
severe severe symptoms.

What are the symptoms?
It's thought that people can have the virus for up to 14 days without having any symptoms.
This time before symptoms develop is called the incubation period.

Some people who get COVID-19 don't get any symptoms at all. But many will have an
illness like a bad cold or flu. Some people will have a more severe illness, like
pneumonia.

About 80 in every 100 people with symptoms will have a mild or moderate illness, 15
in 100 people will have a severe illness and 5 in 100 people will have a very severe
(critical) illness.

You’re more likely to have a severe illness if:


you are older


you live in a nursing home or care home


you are male


you are obese


you are a smoker


you have high blood pressure


you have diabetes


you have cardiovascular disease (a condition affecting your heart or your blood vessels:
for example, heart attack, stroke, heart failure, angina)



you have a long-lasting condition that affects your lungs, such as asthma or chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)



you have non-alcoholic fatty liver disease


you have cancer


you have had an organ transplant


you are recovering from surgery.


The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are:


fever


coughing


shortness of breath


loss of sense of smell, and


reduced sense of taste


Less common symptoms can include:


aches and pains


feeling tired


diarrhoea


feeling nauseous or vomiting


abdominal (tummy) pain


loss of appetite


coughing up a lot of phlegm


sore throat


confusion


dizziness


blocked or runny nose


conjunctivitis (red or watery eyes)


headache


skin rashes


chilblaines, and


coughing up blood.


Children seem to be less severely affected than adults.
But there have been reports of COVID-19 causing a severe illness in some children,
with a fever lasting more than five days, a rash, swollen glands in the neck, red
fingers or toes, and dry, cracked lips.

This is very rare. But if you have concerns about your child, it’s very important
to speak to a doctor as soon as possible.

As you can see, many of the less serious symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to those
of a bad cold or flu. So it can be hard to diagnose COVID-19 without testing.

If your doctor thinks that you might have COVID-19, you might need some tests, such
as collecting a sample from your nose or mouth, blood tests, a chest x-ray, or another
type of scan of your chest called a CT (computed tomography) scan.

Some people who are seriously ill with COVID-19 can develop problems with their kidneys,
liver, blood, heart, or brain. If this happens, you might need more tests and extra
care.

Pregnant and breastfeeding women
We don't know for certain whether the virus can pass from a mother who is infected
to her baby in the womb, or to a baby through breastfeeding.

The symptoms of COVID-19 during pregnancy are the same as in people who are not pregnant.
If you are pregnant and you develop symptoms, you should contact your doctor straight
away. You might need regular ultrasound scans during your pregnancy if you have had
COVID-19. And you and your baby might need extra monitoring during labour and after
the birth.

Some countries, such as the UK, recommend that pregnant women should follow strict
social distancing measures.

Prevention
You can take measures to reduce your risk of being infected with COVID-19. These include:


washing your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after
being in a public place. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based
hand sanitiser containing at least 60 percent alcohol





avoiding touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands




cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces every day, including counter
tops, phones, light switches, handles, and door knobs





avoid close contact with people who are sick. The recommended distance between people
varies between countries. For example, 2 metres (6 feet) is recommended in the US
and UK.



You should follow any national or regional policies on social distancing. These policies
can change quite suddenly, depending on how quickly a particular variant of the virus
is spreading, and on how local health services are coping.

Depending on where you live, restrictions might include:


cancelling or limiting the size of public gatherings


not attending schools and universities


not visiting cafes, bars, restaurants, and other businesses


working from home if possible


only leaving the house for essential journeys: for example, to buy food or medicine


not letting your pet interact with people and animals outside your household. At this
time, there is no evidence that pets and other animals can spread COVID-19 but caution
is advised. Cats can become infected after contact with people who have COVID-19.
Scientists are carrying out research in this area.



If you become ill, you should:


stay home and avoid contact with other people


seek medical care right away. But call ahead to your doctor or emergency department
and tell them about your symptoms



not travel while you are unwell


cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when coughing
or sneezing, then put the tissue into the bin



wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after
coughing, sneezing, blowing your nose, or being in a public place. If soap and water
are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitiser containing at least 60 percent
alcohol



limit contact with pets and other animals.


Most experts and governments now strongly recommend face masks or coverings in some
settings: for example, in indoor public areas, such as shops, and on public transport.
In some countries, face coverings are mandatory (this means that you have to wear
one) in places such as shops and on public transport.

The World Health Organization advises that you should wear a mask if you are a healthcare
worker or if you are caring for someone with COVID-19 at home, or when social distancing
is difficult.

If you wear a mask, you should wash your hands with soap and water, or use an alcohol-based
hand sanitiser, before putting on the mask. You will still need to wash your hands
often and thoroughly while wearing the mask.

Children aged less than 5 years should not wear masks.
The chance of the infection spreading from food products or packaging shipped over
a period of days or weeks is very small.

The UK government advises it is very unlikely that you can catch COVID-19 from food.
But you should follow good hygiene and preparation practices when handling and eating
raw fruit, leafy salads and vegetables.

This means washing fresh produce to help to remove any contamination on the surface
and peeling the outer layers or skins of certain fruits and vegetables.

Vitamin D
Vitamin D is important in keeping your immune system strong and preventing infections.
We can't yet say for certain if it helps prevent COVID-19. But there is some evidence
that it helps prevent chest infections.

Many people don't get enough vitamin D, especially in the winter months. This is because
we get most of our vitamin D from sunlight on our skin. So some sun exposure on most
days is important. But remember: too much sun can cause skin cancer, so it's important
to avoid burning.

In some countries, such as the UK, it's now recommended that people take a daily vitamin
D supplement. This is especially important in the winter months, and if you spend
a long time indoors because of lockdown rules.

Travel restrictions and policies
Travel restrictions and other quarantine measures have been introduced to try to stop
the spread of the virus.

Travel advice can change rapidly and can vary between areas. You should check the
latest advice from the government in your country before planning a trip.

What treatments are available?
There is no cure for COVID-19. But vaccination programmes are well under way in many
countries.

Different medicines are being tested to see whether they can help patients with COVID-19.
The research is in the early stages, so these medicines are normally only given as
part of a clinical trial.

A drug called remdesivir may be used in patients who have severe COVID-19. Remdesivir
is a type of drug called an antiviral, which means that it is used to fight viruses.

In some countries, including the UK, powerful anti-inflammatory medications called
corticosteroids are being given to some people with severe breathing problems. Early
research suggests that this treatment can help some people to breathe more easily
and prevent death.

Other drugs are being studied to see if they might be useful. And there are many more
treatments available than at the start of the pandemic.

For example, drugs called monoclonal antibodies are now being used to treat people whose symptoms are severe, or who are thought
to be at risk of having severe symptoms. These drugs can reduce someone's chances
of having severe symptoms or of dying.

Hospital treatment
The treatment for someone with COVID-19 is the same as for pneumonia or any other
serious viral chest infection.

If you are treated in hospital, the treatment will consist of:


rest


making sure you get plenty of fluids, possibly through an IV (intravenous) drip


medication to reduce fever and reduce pain, if needed


oxygen, if you need it, and


close monitoring.


You might also be given antibiotics to begin with, in case you have a bacterial infection.
But if testing shows that you have a viral infection, the antibiotics will be stopped,
as antibiotics don’t work against viruses.

Some other medicines are beginning to be used, and we will know more about these as
time goes on.

People with severe symptoms might be treated in an intensive care unit (ICU). If you
need to be treated in intensive care, your treatment might also include:



a tube passed through your mouth to your windpipe, called an endotracheal tube, and


a ventilator to support your breathing.


Some people being treated in hospital might also need treatment for sepsis.
Home treatment
In most countries, people who are seriously ill would probably be isolated and treated
in hospital.

But if someone has mild symptoms of suspected COVID-19, they can probably be looked
after at home until they can be tested.

For example, in the UK, people who have symptoms are advised not to go to hospital
right away, but to stay at home and contact their health authorities, and to follow
their advice. This will help stop the spread of the virus.

The guidance for looking after them at home is as follows:


They should be looked after in a well ventilated room by themselves, and should stay
in that room as much as possible, so that they don’t spread the infection.



The number of people who look after the ill person should be limited to as few as
possible.



Ideally, anyone looking after the ill person should be in good health.


If you wear a medical mask while looking after someone with symptoms, change it for
a new one if it comes into contact with their bodily fluids.



Wash your hands thoroughly after touching the ill person. You might want to wear disposable
gloves, such as latex gloves.



Dispose carefully of any tissues the person uses.


Don’t share anything like towels or bedclothes with the ill person.


Carefully wash any plates, drinking glasses and cutlery after they use it.


Regularly wipe and disinfect any surfaces the person touches regularly, such as bedside
tables.



Clean toilet and bathroom surfaces regularly.


Clean all clothes, bedclothes, and towels used by the ill person at 60 to 90° C.


The ill person should limit contact with pets and other animals. At this time, there
is no evidence that pets and other animals can spread COVID-19 but caution is advised.
Cats can become infected with coronavirus after contact with people who have COVID-19.
Scientists are doing research in this area.



Keep taking any prescribed medications, unless your doctor recommends that you stop.


The advice might change as we find out more about this virus and how it spreads.
If you are looking after someone who might have COVID-19 at home, your whole household
might need to stay in isolation for up to 14 days, to reduce the risk of passing on
the infection. If you are not sure what to do, contact your doctor for advice.

Recovery and long-lasting symptoms
Most people recover quickly from COVID-19. But about 10 in 100 people will have symptoms
that last longer than 3 weeks. And some people’s symptoms will last for months. You
might have heard the term “long covid” used to describe symptoms that go on for a
long time.

These long-lasting symptoms are more likely to happen if your symptoms were severe
to begin with. But they can happen to people of any age who have had the coronavirus.
These symptoms can come and go, so that you have good and bad days.

The most common ongoing symptoms seem to be:


coughing


low-grade fever, and


fatigue.


Other, less common ongoing symptoms can include:


shortness of breath


pain, including chest pain, headaches, or just general aches and pains


rashes


upset stomach


problems with memory and concentration, and


mental health problems, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).


If you have severe ongoing symptoms, your doctor might suggest tests, such as blood
and urine tests to look for infections, or x-rays.

It might be that these symptoms will ease or disappear given time and rest. But we
don't know enough about covid yet to be sure what is likely to happen.

If you have been treated in hospital for severe COVID-19, your doctor should arrange
for any ongoing treatment that you need. But even if you didn’t need hospital treatment,
you can still have long-lasting symptoms. Talk to your doctor about what help might
be available.

Mental health issues affect many people who have suffered with COVID-19. For example,
many people struggle with stress, anxiety, and PTSD. If you feel that you need help,
talk to your doctor, and to family and friends.

What to expect in the future
It’s not possible to say what will happen to someone infected with COVID-19. The outcome
can vary. What we know so far is that:



the infection is most likely to be serious in older people with existing long-term
health problems. But most people with COVID-19 don't become seriously ill



about 80 in 100 people with COVID-19 have a mild or moderate illness


about 20 in 100 people develop more severe symptoms


more than 500 million confirmed cases have been reported worldwide


more than 6 million people have died.


The best thing you can do is to follow the advice about travel restrictions, other
prevention measures and about what to do if you feel ill. This will help to protect
you and the people around you.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, doctors have noticed that fewer people are coming to
hospital with serious illnesses like heart attacks or cancers. If you feel unwell,
even if you don’t think you have COVID-19, it is very important to get help. Hospitals
are still open for other emergencies.

If you usually do a lot of exercise, you should rest for at least two weeks after
recovering from COVID-19 or testing positive for coronavirus. You should speak to
your doctor about when you can start exercising again.

Looking after your mental health
It’s normal to feel worried about coronavirus. This is an uncertain time and you might
be feeling bored, lonely, anxious, frustrated or low.

It’s important to remember that, for most people, these feelings will pass. Here are
some things that you can do to look after your mental health during the coronavirus
pandemic:



stay connected with friends and family: for example, by phone or via the internet


talk about your worries


carry on doing things you enjoy


keep on getting support for your physical and mental health difficulties, if possible.
Many healthcare providers offer phone or video appointments.



eat healthy meals and drink enough water


exercise regularly


try not to drink too much alcohol


try to maintain a regular sleeping pattern."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/3000208/Coronavirus%20%28COVID-19%29%3A%20vaccines,Coronavirus (COVID-19): vaccines,"Coronavirus (COVID-19): vaccines Last published: Feb 04, 2022
Several vaccines are now available to protect people against COVID-19, and more are
being developed. Vaccination programmes are under way in many countries.

This leaflet explains what the vaccines do, how they are given, who can have them,
and how safe they are.

We are learning more about these vaccines all the time. So some of the advice about
them might change as we find out more.

What is a COVID-19 vaccine?
The COVID-19 virus spread around the world in 2020 and is still infecting people.
Many millions of people have become ill and millions have died.

Scientists in several countries have now developed vaccines to help protect against
the virus. For example, in the UK, there are now five vaccines approved for use.

The approved vaccines are:


the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine (usually just called the Pfizer vaccine)



the Moderna vaccine



the AstraZeneca vaccine



the Janssen vaccine, and



the Novavax vaccine.



These vaccines all offer protection against the virus that causes COVID-19. But this
doesn’t mean that they will always work for everyone - there are no perfect vaccines.
But the COVID-19 vaccines will work for most people.

This means that people who become infected after having the vaccine are much less
likely to become ill than if they don’t have the vaccine.

The various vaccines do the same job, but they are all slightly different in the way
they work and in the protection they provide.

The type of vaccine that your healthcare professional offers you might depend on what
is available locally and what is most suitable for you.

How is the vaccine given?
You might be invited, for example by letter or text message, to have the vaccine at
your doctor’s surgery or at a clinic or vaccination centre.

You get the vaccine as an injection into the muscle of the upper arm. With most of
the vaccines, you will need two doses, several weeks apart. Your healthcare professional will let you know when the second
one is due.

The Janssen vaccine is given as one single dose. This means that you don't need a second dose of this vaccine.

If you have the Pfizer vaccine, you might need to wait for 15 to 30 minutes before
you can go home. This is so the doctor can keep an eye on you, in case you have any
side effects that suggest that you might be allergic to the ingredients of the vaccine.

If you have have a severe allergic reaction after the vaccine, you might need treatment.
This will usually be an injection of adrenaline.
You might be familiar with this type of treatment if you know someone who has allergies
and who has to carry an injector, sometimes called an ""EpiPen"", which they can use
to treat themselves if they have an allergic reaction.

Who can have the vaccine?
Most adults can have the vaccine, although the rules vary a little between the vaccines.
And many countries have now approved some vaccines for children. For example, in the
UK:



people aged 12 years and over can have the Pfizer vaccine


people aged 18 years and over can have the Moderna, AstraZeneca, Novavax, or Janssen
vaccines.



It is likely that the situation will change as we learn more. For example, some vaccines
might be made available to younger children in some countries.

Pregnant and breastfeeding women
The advice about pregnant women currently varies between countries. For example, the
World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the vaccine in pregnant women if the benefits
are thought to outweigh the risks.

But in some countries including the UK, pregnant women are strongly encouraged to
have the vaccine.

If you are concerned about whether you should have the vaccine, talk to your doctor.
Advice about breastfeeding varies between countries. This doesn’t mean that it’s unsafe
to have the vaccine if you’re breastfeeding. It just means that some countries are
taking a more cautious approach until there is more information available.

If you’re breastfeeding, tell your doctor, or the healthcare professional vaccinating
you, before you have the vaccine. They should be able to give you some relevant information.
If you’re not happy to have the vaccine, your decision should be respected.

Teenagers and children
At first, the vaccines were not recommended for children. This was because:


children are far less likely than adults to have severe illness, and




health authorities wanted to be sure that the vaccine was safe enough to give to children.


Now that we know more, many countries are now vaccinating children in various age
groups.

For example, The UK and the European Union have approved the Pfizer vaccine for use in children aged 12 to 15 years. In the US, the Pfizer vaccine is
now approved for children as young as 5 years old.

When will I get the vaccine?
Most people in many countries will now have had their first doses of the vaccine.
The vaccine is offered to people based on who needs it most urgently. This means that
the first people to get it will usually be:



people who have the greatest chance of getting COVID-19, and


those most likely to become seriously ill if they are infected.


For example, some of the first groups of people to be offered the vaccine are likely
to be:



those who live or work in nursing homes or care homes for older people


frontline healthcare workers, and


people aged over 65.


After these people have been vaccinated, others will gradually be offered the vaccine
based on who is most in need of it. For example, people with serious health conditions
will usually be offered it ahead of people who are in good health.

Vaccination programmes are at different stages in different countries. In the UK,
for example, all adults and some older children should now have had a chance to be
vaccinated.

Booster vaccinations
Many countries are now offering booster vaccinations to certain groups of people.
This is because the vaccine becomes less effective over time.

A booster does what the name suggests: it tops up or 'boosts' your protection against
the virus, so that, if infected, you are much less likely to become severely ill.

For example, in the UK, booster injections were first offered to vulnerable and older
people, and to healthcare workers. But boosters are now offered to everyone over 18
years old.

The boosters in the UK will be single doses of either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine.
You will probably not be offered a booster until at least three months after your
last dose of your initial vaccine.

If you live in the UK, the NHS might contact you when your booster is due. Or you
might be able to book one online without being invited. Depending on where you live,
you might also be able to go to a walk-in centre for a booster.

Is there anyone who shouldn’t have the vaccine?
The vaccine is not currently recommended for some groups of people. This doesn’t mean
for certain that it’s not safe for them. It just means that we don’t know enough about
the new vaccines yet to be absolutely sure.

People with certain allergies
A small number of people have had allergic reactions after having the Pfizer version
of the vaccine.

You should:


not have the vaccine if you are allergic to any of its ingredients


tell the health professionals giving you the vaccine about any allergies you have,
before you have the injection. He or she will check if these are a problem.



Food allergies should not be a problem. If you have a food allergy you should be able
to have the vaccine.

If you have an allergic reaction to the first dose of the vaccine, you should not
have the second dose.

People with weakened immune systems
Some medical conditions and some medications can cause the body’s immune system to
become weaker. This means that infections can be more serious.

The COVID-19 vaccines don’t contain any live organisms, so they are thought to be
safe for people with weakened immune systems (doctors call this being immunocompromised).

But you should mention to the health professional giving you the vaccine if you have
a weakened immune system for any reason, before you have the injection.

How safe is the vaccine?
The COVID-19 vaccinations are considered safe. But, like any vaccine and any medication,
they can cause side effects in some people. These side effects are usually mild. The
most common ones are:



pain, redness, swelling, or bruising in your arm where you have the injection. This
can last for a few days



tiredness


headache


fever


nausea, and


pain in a joint or muscles.


These side effects can make you feel pretty miserable, a bit like a mild flu. But
they shouldn't last more than a few days.

There are some simple things you can do to help with some of the side effects.


If you have pain in your arm near where you had the injection, keep using and moving
the arm so that it doesn’t stiffen up. You could also try an over-the-counter painkiller,
such as paracetamol or ibuprofen.



If you have fever, drink plenty of fluids, rest if you need to, and dress lightly
to keep cool.



If you have severe side effects, or if you have any problems that don’t go away soon
after you are vaccinated, tell your doctor or another healthcare professional right
away.

Blood clots
You might have heard that the AstraZeneca and Janssen vaccines have been linked to blood clots in a small number of people. The information
changes constantly as we find out more. But studies so far suggest that:



about 12 people in every one million who have the AstraZeneca vaccine have developed
this type of blood clot



about one person in every one million who have had the AstraZeneca vaccine have died
from this type of blood clot



blood clots seem to be less common with the Janssen vaccine, and they tend to happen
in women aged between 18 and 59.



Blood clots happen for many different reasons. So, while it is possible that the vaccine
caused the blood clots, we don't know for sure, and more research is being done to
try to find out.

In the meantime, the advice might vary depending on where you live. For example, in
the UK, people are still advised to have the vaccine, as the risk of blood clots is
extremely small compared with the benefits of protecting the population from the virus.

The blood clots seem to be more common in younger people. So it's possible that younger
people might be offered vaccines other than the AstraZeneca vaccine. This might depend
on where you live.

For example, in the UK, there are plans to offer people aged 39 and younger a vaccine other than the AstraZeneca vaccine, provided that:



another vaccine is available, and


this does not cause a major delay in people being vaccinated.


The AstraZeneca vaccine is also not recommended for people with a blood disorder called
capillary leak syndrome.

After you have the vaccine
Having the vaccine might not stop you from becoming infected with the virus. But it
can reduce your chance of becoming seriously ill with COVID-19.

But the vaccines take time to work. So you might not be protected for up to two weeks
after your first dose of the vaccine. With vaccines that are given as two doses, the
best protection comes after you have had both doses.

Also, vaccinated people who are infected can still pass the the virus onto others.
So it’s important to keep doing the things that help keep you and others safe. That
means:



wearing a face covering


washing your hands carefully and often, and


practising social distancing.

This information is about coronary artery bypass surgery. It explains how the operation
is done, how it can help, what the risks are, and what to expect afterwards.

It’s important to remember that different hospitals sometimes have slightly different
methods and procedures. You can use our information to talk with your doctor about
the treatment you will have.

What is a coronary artery bypass?
A coronary artery bypass is an operation to improve the blood flow to your heart.


Your heart is a muscle about the size of a fist. It has its own blood vessels called
coronary arteries. These arteries bring the heart muscle the oxygen it needs to keep
pumping blood around your body.

Heart disease can cause these arteries to become too narrow for blood to flow properly.
If this happens, your heart doesn't get enough oxygen. This can cause chest pain.

In a bypass operation, a surgeon takes sections of healthy blood vessels from another
part of your body (such as your leg) and uses them to replace the narrowed sections
of the arteries in your heart.

The full name for this operation is a coronary artery bypass graft, or CABG (pronounced 'cabbage').

Why might I need a coronary artery bypass?
If you have heart disease it can cause problems, including chest pain called angina.
Angina can be treated with medications. But if they don’t help, your doctor might
suggest surgery.

Your doctor might suggest that you have bypass surgery if:


you still get chest pain even if you are taking pills to treat angina


tests show narrowing in the arteries in your heart. Your doctor is more likely to
suggest an operation if several of your heart's arteries have narrowed, or if the
narrowing is close to the body's main artery, called the aorta


the left side of your heart isn't working as well as it should


you get chest pain whenever you do anything that needs physical effort


you have a narrowed artery that can't be widened by a simpler operation called coronary angioplasty.



What will happen?
Bypass surgery usually takes between three and six hours. You'll be given a general
anaesthetic, so you'll be asleep during the operation.

At the start of the operation, the surgeon takes some healthy blood vessels from another
part of your body.

These will be attached (grafted) onto the arteries in your heart. The healthy blood vessels will then be able to
carry blood around (bypass) the narrow parts of the arteries in your heart.

Healthy blood vessels can be taken from your leg, chest, or arm. Your blood will still
be able to flow normally in these areas, as other blood vessels will take over.

The number of blood vessels the surgeon needs to remove will depend on how many parts
of your coronary arteries the surgeon needs to bypass. Some people only need one or
two grafts, but most need three or four.

This is what happens during the bypass operation:


The surgeon will usually make a cut down the middle of your breastbone and gently
pull your ribs apart so your heart can be seen.



The surgeon might need to stop your heart so that it doesn't keep beating while he
or she is trying to sew the new blood vessels in place. While your heart is stopped,
a heart-lung machine is used to pump blood around your body.

These days, more surgeons can do the operation without stopping your heart. This is
called off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery (or OPCAB). But the machine is always there in case you need it.



The surgeon will then sew the new blood vessel (the graft) to your coronary artery,
bypassing the narrow part. One end of the healthy vessel will be sewn above the blockage,
and the other end below.



After the surgeon has stitched all the grafts in place, the heart-lung machine will
be switched off and your heart will start beating again.



The cut along your breastbone is then stitched up.


After the operation, you'll be taken to intensive care or a cardiac recovery ward,
where nurses will keep a close eye on you overnight.

Sometimes there is fluid left in your chest after the operation, and you'll have a
tube put in your chest to drain it. The tube is usually taken out the next day. In
one or two days you should be well enough to walk.

How might it help?
If you have angina, having bypass surgery can help you in several ways. For example,
it can:



reduce your chances of having a heart attack


reduce chest pain and breathlessness. Most people who have bypass surgery find that
they have no pain after their operation. Many people have no symptoms for many years
afterwards



reduce the amount of medication you need to take for angina


improve your quality of life and generally make you feel better and healthier. You
should find it easier to go out and see family and friends, and to enjoy the things
you like to do.



If you have had a heart attack, bypass surgery can help you live longer, compared
with drug treatment alone.

But bypass surgery can't cure your heart disease. Your arteries can become narrow
again in new places. You can reduce the chances of this happening by:



stopping smoking (if you smoke)


taking the medications you need, and


exercising regularly.


What are the risks?
All operations have risks, and your surgeon should discuss them with you before your
surgery.

The list of possible problems below might look long and frightening. But remember,
these are just things that might happen, not things that will definitely happen. Many
people have only minor problems or none at all.

One common cause of side effects is the anaesthetic you will have before your operation, which can make some people feel nauseous.

Anaesthetics can also cause more serious problems, such as allergic reactions, breathing
problems, and heart problems. These are serious but rare. If you have any allergies,
it’s important that you tell your doctor before you have surgery.

Other short-term problems that can happen include:



pain in your chest. It takes months for the breastbone to heal, and you might need
to take painkillers for a few weeks. If you are in pain, tell a doctor or nurse straight
away. Don't put up with pain while you wait for your next scheduled dose of painkillers



pain where the surgeon removed a blood vessel. If a vein was removed from your leg,
you might have swelling there for a while



an irregular heartbeat. It might feel as though your heart misses a beat, or beats
too quickly. This should settle down after a few days, but you might need medication
to help your heart beat regularly again



needing a blood transfusion. This is fairly common after bypass surgery, and it’s
usually not serious. But some people need to have surgery to stop any excess bleeding



breathing problems. Some people need to be put on a ventilator for a short time to
help them breathe properly. Most people can breathe normally again within a day or
two



a heart attack. It is rare, but some people have a heart attack during or just after
the operation. If this happens you will have emergency treatment



a stroke. Some people have a stroke during or just after the operation. Again, if
this happens you will need emergency treatment.



Longer-term problems that can happen include:



infection. This is a risk with every kind of surgery. There's a small chance that
the wound in your chest or around where your arteries were grafted will become infected
and that you'll need to stay in hospital for a few extra days and have antibiotics



problems with your memory. You might not feel as sharp mentally after the operation.
But this usually clears up within a few months



a heart attack or a stroke. As well as sometimes happening during the operation, these
can also sometimes happen in the weeks after your surgery



kidney problems. These usually get better over time, and serious problems are rare.
But some people will need to have dialysis



dying in the weeks after your operation. About 3 in every 100 people die within 30
days of having bypass surgery.



What can I expect afterwards?
Most people recover quickly and are walking again after two days, and at home within
10 days.

If you have high blood pressure or high cholesterol as well as angina, you'll need
to keep taking medications for these conditions even after your bypass operation.

If you're overweight, you might need to lose weight. If you smoke, you should do everything
you can to stop. Smoking makes any treatment less likely to work.

Going home
A coronary artery bypass is a major operation and it can take months to recover fully.
Don't expect too much of yourself too soon. You might feel more tired than you used
to, but you'll slowly get your strength back.

You shouldn't drive for four to six weeks after your operation. If you have a commercial
licence (to drive a lorry, for example) you will need to tell your local driving authority
about your operation. For example, in the UK, it’s the DVLA.

You might feel anxious or depressed when you get home. It’s normal to feel like this
for a while after the stress your body has been under. Try not to worry about these
feelings. If they last for more than a few weeks, ask your doctor for advice.

You might be invited to take part in a cardiac rehabilitation programme run by your local hospital. This usually starts about six weeks after your operation
and includes exercise classes and advice on what you can do to keep your heart healthy.

Programmes usually last about six weeks. Afterwards, you might want to think about
joining a heart support group. Ask your doctor or nurse for information about groups
in your area.

You can have sex again after your operation as soon as you feel able to, but you might
want to wait for a few weeks. You should be careful not to put too much pressure on
your breast bone, as it will still be healing."

This information is about an operation to widen blood vessels in your heart that have
become too narrow. It explains how and why the operation is done, what the risks are,
and what to expect afterwards.

You can use our information to talk with your doctor about this operation.
What is a coronary angioplasty?
The blood vessels that carry blood from your heart to the rest of your body are called
arteries.

If you have heart disease, the insides of your arteries can become coated with fatty
patches. This can make parts of your arteries narrow and “furred up”. This makes it
harder for blood to flow through them freely.

If this happens to the arteries inside your heart (called the coronary arteries) it
can cause chest pain.

This pain is called angina. It happens when the flow of blood is reduced so much that your heart doesn’t get
enough oxygen. If an artery is completely blocked it can cause a heart attack.

When you have an angioplasty, a doctor uses a tiny balloon to widen a narrowed blood
vessel in your heart so that blood can flow more easily.

You may also hear angioplasty called percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty
(PTCA).

The aims of this operation are to:


stop or reduce chest pain


improve your quality of life


reduce your chance of a heart attack, and


help you to live longer.


Angiogram
To find out if angioplasty will help you, you'll need a test called an angiogram.
This is an x-ray that shows up any narrow parts in your arteries.

In this test, your doctor threads a thin, hollow tube into an artery in your groin
or arm. Dye is passed through the tube and flows through your bloodstream to your
heart, where it shows up any narrow parts in the arteries there.

Why might I need an angioplasty?
Not everyone with heart disease needs an angioplasty. Many people manage with medication.
But your doctor may suggest this procedure if:



you get chest pain even though you are taking medication for angina


an angiogram shows narrowed arteries in your heart that could be causing chest pain


your doctor thinks that your narrowed artery can be opened up by angioplasty.


Other reasons why someone might have an angioplasty include:


if you've had heart bypass surgery but an artery has furred up again, and


as an emergency treatment after a heart attack.


If you do have an angioplasty, you'll still need to take medication afterwards, but
you might be able to take less. If you're overweight, your doctor might encourage
you to lose weight.

If you smoke, you should do everything you can to quit. Smoking makes any treatment
for heart disease less likely to work.

What will happen?
Depending on where you live, you may be able to choose where you have your operation.
You can ask your doctor about which hospitals specialise in this type of operation.


The operation itself usually takes between 30 minutes and one hour. It is done with
a local anaesthetic, so you will be awake, but you won’t feel much.

You may feel a little chest pain for the short time that the balloon is inflated in
your artery. If it bothers you, you can have painkillers or a sedative medication
to relax you.

You may notice that you miss a heartbeat or two while the balloon is doing its work.
This is normal

Angioplasty is not done by operating on your chest. Instead, the surgeon reaches your
heart through an artery in your groin, wrist, or arm.

A local anaesthetic in the area makes the skin numb. The doctor will then:


make a small cut and thread a thin tube (called a catheter), with a tiny balloon on
it, into the artery



check on the x-ray screen that the tube is in the right place, and gently push it
up to the arteries in your heart, until it reaches the narrow part



inflate the balloon, pushing the fatty patches that are causing the narrowing onto
the inside walls of the artery. Usually the catheter also carries a short tube made
of stainless steel (called a stent). This is pushed out as the balloon is blown up
and is left inside your artery. Blood can now flow freely through the stent even in
a narrowed part of the artery.

Some stents are coated in medication that helps prevent them from becoming blocked
and the artery from narrowing again. These are called drug-eluting stents. You can
talk with your doctor about what type of stent is best for you.



check that the artery has been widened enough to allow blood to flow through easily.
This is done by injecting dye into the catheter to see how well it flows through the
artery. Once blood is flowing well, the balloon is let down and taken out.



How might an angioplasty help me?
An angioplasty can help prevent heart attacks and help you live longer. But it can
also make simple but important differences to your daily life. For example, it can
help to:



reduce chest pain


reduce the amount of medication you need to take


make you feel less breathless


walk further, go up stairs more easily, and make other simple physical things less
of a struggle



generally make you feel better, and more able to enjoy life.


If you have an angioplasty as part of treatment after a heart attack, it can help
reduce your chances of having another heart attack or a stroke, or of dying.

Having a stent fitted can reduce the chance of your artery narrowing again, which
makes it less likely that you’ll need another angioplasty.

What are the risks?
All operations have risks. With an angioplasty, you’re more likely to have complications
depending on where the problem is in your artery, and on how narrow the artery has
become.

You’re also more likely to have problems if you are older and have other health problems,
such as diabetes or heart failure.

The list of possible complications with this procedure might look long and worrying.
But remember, these are just things that might happen. Many people have no problems
at all.

Problems that can happen in the short term include:


bleeding slightly more than usual where the catheter goes in. This can cause bruising,
but this will go away after a while. More severe bleeding can also sometimes happen.
If it does, you may need a blood transfusion



an infection where the catheter is put in


an allergic reaction to the dye. Tell the doctor before the operation if you have
any allergies



the operation might not work if the narrowing is too severe


having a heart attack during the procedure. If this happens you might need emergency
open heart surgery



having a stroke


dying during the procedure.


Longer-term problems include:


needing another angioplasty if your arteries fur up again. This is not uncommon


needing heart bypass surgery if the angioplasty doesn’t work well enough and you’re
still having severe angina.



What can I expect afterwards?
You may be able to go home the same day after your operation, but that’s not always
possible. You should be able to go home the next day, though. But you will need to
be collected, as you shouldn’t drive for a week after the operation.

After angioplasty many people feel better than they have done for years. For example,
you may find that you can do more things without getting breathless or feeling pain
in your chest.

But you should give yourself time to recover. Don’t lift anything heavy for the first
few days. And don't try to do too much in the first week. Although it’s fine to have
sex again as soon as you feel ready.

After that you should be able to drive a car. But if you drive a vehicle for which
you need a special licence (such as a truck or bus) you need to wait six weeks and
have some tests to check your fitness."

Experts used to think that children grew out of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD) when they were teenagers. Although it’s true that the symptoms of hyperactivity
often improve as children get older, we now know that many people who had ADHD as
children still have difficulty with concentration, impulsive behaviour, and relationships
as teenagers and adults.

If you're a teenager or adult with ADHD, you may need to continue taking medicines
and having talking treatments to manage your ADHD symptoms. Adopting certain strategies
may also help you cope day to day.

COPD stands for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It means that lung damage is
stopping your lungs working as well as they used to. There is no cure but there are
treatments that can help stop it getting worse.
You can use our information to talk to your doctor and decide which treatments are
right for you.
What treatments work?
If you have COPD the airways in your lungs have been damaged over many years. This
damage is usually caused by smoking. But other things can cause COPD, including:



breathing in other poisonous chemicals (possibly through long exposure to severe air
pollution), and



some inherited genetic conditions.


The aims of treatment for COPD are:


to prevent and control symptoms


to reduce the number of exacerbations (this is when your symptoms suddenly get worse)
you have and to make them less severe.



to help your lungs to work better, and


to help you live a longer and healthier life.


Your treatment should include regular appointments with your doctor to check on your
progress. Your doctor should make sure that you understand:



what COPD is, and


how to recognise an exacerbation.


Stopping smoking
These days, the main cause of COPD is smoking. Stopping smoking can:


slow down the damage COPD does to your lungs


reduce your chance of cancer and heart problems related to COPD


help you live longer with a better quality of life.


Of course, stopping smoking is not easy, especially if you have smoked for many years.
So your doctor may recommend a stop-smoking programme to help you stop. This may include
counselling, group meetings, and medication.

For more information on ways to help you stop smoking, see our leaflet Stopping smoking.

Staying healthy
Your doctor might discuss self-management with you. This doesn't mean that you have to take care of yourself, without medical
care. It means that you are helped to learn about COPD so that you can help control
it.

People who learn to self-manage their COPD tend to need less hospital treatment.
Self-management plans that you discuss with your doctor should include learning about:


managing breathlessness


managing stress


conserving energy


avoiding things that make your symptoms worse


the right types of exercise for people with COPD (and specifically for you), and


contact information to use if you have an exacerbation.


Some people are able to take part in a lung-care programme. They're usually called
pulmonary rehabilitation programmes).

These programmes are usually organised in hospitals. You'll learn about how your lungs
work and how to do exercises that make them stronger. You'll need to keep doing these
exercises at home, after your programme finishes.

You'll also learn about your medicines and the best way to take them. Ask your doctor
if there’s a local programme near you.

Taking part in a programme can:


reduce your chance of needing hospital treatment


reduce the depression and anxiety that sometimes go along with COPD


reduce fatigue


increase how much you are able to exercise


help improve your quality of life: for example, by helping you feel more in control
of your life and your illness.



Regular exercise can help you stay healthy. Even gentle exercise, such as walking,
can help you get fitter and do more of the things you enjoy. Everyone with COPD should
try to do as much exercise as they can to keep their lungs as fit as possible.

It's also important to get your flu and pneumonia jabs (vaccinations). If you have
COPD, getting flu or pneumonia can be very serious. Talk to your doctor and make sure
you get protected. You need a new flu jab every year.

Medicines you breathe in
Many types of medicine are used to treat people with COPD, depending on what works
best for each person. Here, we look at the main ones.

The first treatment you get for COPD will probably be an inhaler, just as you would
use if you had asthma. Breathing in medicine through an inhaler helps to open up the
airways in your lungs and make breathing easier.

There are several kinds of inhaler, so if you find yours hard to use, talk to your
doctor. He or she will be able to suggest a different type.

Several types of medication can help relieve the symptoms of COPD when inhaled.
Bronchodilators are drugs that help to open up the airwaves by relaxing the muscles around the lungs.
There are different kinds: some work quickly to give you fast relief from symptoms
and others have a more long-term effect.

You may hear your doctor refer to these as short-acting and long-acting drugs. Bronchodilators
that you might be prescribed include:



drugs called beta agonists. These drugs help relax the muscles in the lungs. There
are short-acting and long-acting versions.



anticholinergic drugs. These help relax the muscles in the lungs in a slightly different
way from bronchodilators. They also come in short- and long-acting versions.



Other drugs are available if the main ones don't work well enough, but they are less
commonly used.

Bronchodilators can cause side effects in some people. For example, bronchodilators
called beta-2 agonists may make your hands tremble, or they may make your heart beat
faster, especially if you already have a heart problem.

Taking a beta-2 agonist for a long time slightly raises your chance of heart problems,
so your doctor should monitor you regularly.

If you've already tried short-acting and long-acting inhalers and you still get symptoms,
your doctor may suggest you use a steroid inhaler (the full name is corticosteroid). You use this along with a bronchodilator. You may be able to use a single inhaler
that contains both drugs.

Corticosteroids help open your airways by reducing inflammation in the lungs. They
can help reduce exacerbations and may even help you live longer.

But they are only recommended for people with advanced COPD who have frequent exacerbations.
This is because corticosteroids can cause serious side effects.

The most common side effect is a fungal infection (thrush) in the mouth or throat.
It can usually be avoided by gargling with water after each puff. Other possible side
effects include weakened bones and easy bruising, but these are more common with steroid
tablets than with the inhaled versions.

Corticosteroids can also increase your chances of getting pneumonia. So your doctor
will be cautious about prescribing them if he or she thinks you are at high risk of
pneumonia.

Doctors use what's called a 'stepwise' approach for COPD medications. This means that
you start on the lowest possible dose of medicine that's suitable for the severity
of your symptoms. Your doctor can then increase or reduce the dose or number of drugs
you use, depending on what helps you most.

For your first 'step' you'll probably use a fast-acting inhaler. You can use this
for quick relief when you get breathless. The medicine keeps working for three or
four hours.

If fast-acting inhalers don't seem to help much, your doctor may suggest a long-acting
inhaler. They don't work as quickly, but the effects last for up to 12 hours. So you
only need to take them once or twice a day.

If you are still having severe symptoms, your doctor may suggest that you need oxygen to help you breathe more easily. This will mean keeping a supply of oxygen at home.
Your doctor or nurse will explain how to use the equipment.

Other treatments you may need
If you cough up a lot of mucus your doctor may suggest you try drugs to break up the
mucus. These are called mucolytics and they usually come as tablets.

Some people who have an exacerbation need treatment in hospital. If this happens,
you may be given oxygen to help you breathe more easily, as well as other treatments.

Antibiotics are not usually helpful for COPD. But your doctor might prescribe them if you have
an exacerbation that your doctor thinks has been caused by an infection.

Surgery can help some people with COPD. Types of surgery include bullectomy, where damaged
parts of the lungs are removed, and lung transplant surgery. But surgery for COPD
is usually only used when all other treatments haven't worked."

What is COPD?
If you have COPD the airways in your lungs have been damaged over many years. This
damage is usually caused by smoking. But other things can cause COPD, including breathing
in other poisonous chemicals (possibly through long exposure to severe air pollution),
and some inherited genetic conditions.

There are two main types of lung damage that cause COPD. One is bronchitis, where your airways become narrow and inflamed, making it harder to breathe. Your
lungs may also make too much mucus, which causes coughing.

The bronchitis caused by COPD lasts for a long time. It's not the same as having bronchitis
that's caused by an infection.

The other type of damage is emphysema. This causes parts of your lungs to become less elastic (stretchy) so that they don't
squeeze air out properly. When you breathe out, some old air gets trapped in your
lungs. So you don't get the full amount of fresh air when you breathe in.

Having COPD can mean you have either bronchitis or emphysema, or both at the same
time.

What are the symptoms?
The main symptoms of COPD are coughing and shortness of breath. Your cough may last
a long time. And you may get short of breath doing everyday things, like going for
a walk or doing housework.

You may sometimes get attacks, when your COPD symptoms suddenly get a lot worse than
usual. Doctors call these exacerbations. If you have trouble breathing you should always see a doctor or go to hospital right
away.

If you smoke you may have got used to coughing and think it's normal. But coughing
may be a sign of lung damage, so it's important to get it checked by a doctor.

What will happen to me?
It's hard to say what will happen to you as an individual. Treatments can't repair
the damage to your lungs, but they can help stop it getting worse.

Many people live with COPD for many years without it getting any worse. But others
get worse more quickly, and some people die within a few years of being diagnosed.

Stopping smoking helps slow the damage caused by COPD. You are also more likely to
do better if you don't have other serious illnesses, if lung problems don't run in
your family, and if your symptoms are not severe when you first get treatment.

Trying to keep to a healthy weight can help with your symptoms. For example, people
who are underweight tend to do worse, so eating regularly and keeping your strength
up is important. On the other hand, if you are overweight, losing some weight could
help you breathe more easily.

It's not surprising that COPD can lead to depression in some people. Talk to your
doctor if you feel depressed. There are treatments that can help.

Your doctor should see you at least every six months depending on how severe your
symptoms are. These regular check-ups help your doctor to monitor whether your medication
is as effective as it should be.

Where to get more help or support
COPD is a serious condition, and you may find that getting help and support makes
your life easier. Various support groups and charities offer help and advice to people

Some people choose sterilisation as their form of contraception. This might be because
they have already had a family and they don't want to have to think about contraception
any more.

Men and women can both have a sterilisation procedure. It's a big decision, so you'll
probably want to get all the information you can. You can use our information to talk
to your doctor about whether sterilisation is the right choice for you.

The right contraception for you
There are many types of contraception to choose from. But they are not all suitable
for everyone.

For example, women with heart problems might not be able to take the contraceptive
pill. And people allergic to latex won't be able to use latex condoms.

The type of contraception that suits you best will depend on several things including:


your medical history, including things like allergies and any health conditions that
you have



your lifestyle


whether you need to think about preventing sexually transmitted infections (STIs),
including HIV. For example, this applies to you if you have multiple partners, or
if you change partners, and



your own preferences: for example, you might not want to use some types of contraception
because you're concerned about side effects. Or maybe you don't want to use condoms
because you want something that you don't want to have to think about 'in the moment'.



What is sterilisation?
If you are a woman, sterilisation means having an operation to cut or block your fallopian tubes so that a man's sperm cannot travel along them to fertilise an egg. This stops you
becoming pregnant.

If you are a man, it means having a procedure called a vasectomy, which means you can no longer father a child.

Sterilisation for men
Sterilisation for a man is a minor procedure called a vasectomy. The tubes that carry sperm from the testicles to the penis, called vas deferens,
are cut and sealed off.

Afterwards, you can still ejaculate semen (come) during sex, but there is no sperm
in the semen. So you can't make a woman pregnant.

The procedure is usually done under local anaesthetic, so you're awake but you don't
feel anything. Twelve weeks after the procedure you have your semen tested to make
sure that the procedure has worked, and that there is no sperm in your semen.

Until this test confirms that the procedure has worked, you should use another method
of contraception.

As with any surgical procedure, there are some risks with a vasectomy, including:


pain in the scrotum or testicles


infection, and


bleeding from the blood vessels in the area after the procedure.


These problems are usually either temporary or treatable.
It's rare, but sometimes vasectomies don't work, and pregnancies do happen. Your doctor
should explain the chances of this happening, and answer any other questions you have.

While a vasectomy is reversible in theory, it is intended to be permanent, and the
operation to reverse it is not routinely available. So you will want to take time
to think about it and be sure that you want this procedure before you have it.

Sterilisation for women
Sterilisation for a woman is a more complicated procedure than for a man. It involves
cutting, tying, or removing the fallopian tubes in the womb (uterus). This means that sperm can't reach an egg to fertilise it.

There are several ways of doing this operation. Depending on which you have, you will
need either a general or a local anaesthetic.

You still have periods after having this procedure, and it doesn't affect your sex
drive. But you will need to use another method of contraception for three months afterwards.

Sometimes this operation doesn't work, and women become pregnant. This is very rare.
Your doctor should explain this, and answer any questions you have about the procedure.

Like any type of surgery, there are some risks involved, such as infections, complications
from the anaesthetic, and bleeding that lasts longer than it should. If you have any
problems, talk to your doctor.

Like a vasectomy for a man, female sterilisation is intended as a permanent method
of contraception. So having this procedure is a big decision, and one that you will
want to think about carefully before you go ahead.

The operation can, in theory, be reversed if you change your mind about becoming pregnant.
But the operation to reverse sterilisation is not always available, and it doesn't
always work.

Why contraception matters
The number of unplanned pregnancies tells us how important it is for sexually active
people to think about contraception. For example:



in the UK about 30 in 100 pregnancies are unplanned, and


in the US about 50 in 100 pregnancies are unplanned.


This is not always bad news, of course - for some people, just because a pregnancy
is unplanned doesn't mean it's not wanted.

But many unplanned pregnancies end in abortions, which can cause emotional distress,
and sometimes physical health risks, such as infections.

Sterilisation for men and women is very effective. But it's a big decision.
But whatever method you choose, planning and taking responsibility for contraception
is vital if:



you are a sexually active girl or woman who could become pregnant, and you do not
wish to become pregnant



you are a sexually active male having sex with females of childbearing age, and you
wish to play a responsible part in avoiding an unwanted pregnancy



you think that you might be at risk of HIV or other STIs (for example, if you have
multiple sexual partners) and you want to use a method of contraception that protects
against infection.



Very few methods of contraception are totally effective. But planning gives you the
best chance of being in control of when and if you become pregnant.

Your doctor or practice nurse will be very happy to discuss contraception and family
planning methods that best suit you."

The contraceptive pill has been around for a long time, and it can be very effective
in preventing pregnancy. But some types of the pill are not suitable for everyone.

If you are interested in the pill as your preferred method of contraception, you can
use our information to talk with your doctor about which type of pill is suitable
for you.

The right contraception for you
There are many types of contraception to choose from, including the contraceptive
pill. But they are not all suitable for everyone.

For example, women with heart conditions might not be able to take the pill. And people
allergic to latex won’t be able to use latex condoms.

The type of contraception that suits you best will depend on several things including:


your medical history, including things like allergies and any health conditions that
you have





your lifestyle




whether you need to think about preventing sexually transmitted infections (STIs),
including HIV. For example, this applies to you if you have multiple partners, or
if you change partners, and





your own preferences: for example, you might not want to use some types of contraception
because you’re concerned about side effects. Or maybe you don’t want to use condoms
because you want something that you don’t want to have to think about 'in the moment'.



What is the contraceptive pill?
The contraceptive pill is a pill that stops you getting pregnant. It works mainly
by affecting your hormones so that you don’t release an egg from your ovaries (ovulate)
during your period.

There are two types of contraceptive pill, which use different hormones. They are:


the progestogen-only pill and




the combined oestrogen/progestogen pill - usually called the combined contraceptive
pill.



But there are many different brands of pill, often with different instructions about
how to take them.

For example:


some brands of pill come in packs of 21, which means you only take a pill for 21 days
of your 28-day menstrual cycle. For the other 7 days, you will bleed as you would
normally when having a period





other brands come in packs of 28 pills, even though 7 of the pills don’t actually
do anything, and you still bleed normally on the 7 days that you take these pills.



These pills that don’t do anything are called 'placebo' pills. They are there to help
you stay in the habit of taking your pills, and to help you avoid losing track of
where you are in your cycle.

Your doctor or nurse should explain carefully how your pills work, including what
to do if you miss a pill. And you should feel free to ask any questions you like,
or to tell him or her if you are not clear about the instructions.

With both the progestogen-only and the combined pill, If you decide that you want
to try to become pregnant, just stop taking them and your fertility will return to
normal very soon.

The combined contraceptive pill
The combined pill contains two hormones: one called a progestogen hormone, and one
called oestrogen. The combined pill prevents pregnancy by:



preventing the ovaries from releasing an egg each month


thickening the mucus (fluid) in the cervix so that it’s harder for sperm to reach
an egg, and





thickening the wall of the uterus (womb) so that it’s harder for any fertilised egg
to implant in the wall of the womb. If an egg can’t implant in this way, it can’t
develop.



The combined pill works for about 99 women in 100 when it’s used properly. Using it
properly usually means taking it at roughly the same time every day.

The combined pill can cause side effects in some women, including:


irregular bleeding




nausea




tender breasts, and




headaches.


These side effects usually stop after a few months. But if they don’t, you can talk
with your doctor about changing to a different pill.

Who can take the combined pill?
The combined pill is not suitable for everyone. This is because there is a small chance
that the oestrogen in the pill can cause serious health problems for some women, including
strokes, heart attacks, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

Some women are wary of taking the combined pill because it slightly increases your
chance of breast cancer. But it also slightly reduces your chance of getting endometrial
cancer and ovarian cancer.

Your doctor can explain the cancer risks around the combined pill, and answer any
other questions you have.

If you talk to a doctor or nurse about taking the pill, he or she should ask you about
any other health conditions that you have, to make sure that you don’t take the combined
pill if it’s not suitable for you.

You should not take the combined pill if you:


smoke




migraines with 'aura' (such flashing lights and problems with your vision)




have any history of heart disease




have had a stroke




have severe liver disease




have very high blood pressure




have ever had deep vein thrombosis.


The progestogen-only pill
This pill uses only one type of hormone, called a progestogen. It can be very effective
at preventing pregnancy. Like the combined pill, it works best when you take it at
the same time every day.

There are different types of progestogen pill, which each use a different progestogen
hormone. The progestogen pill is often taken by women who can’t take the combined
pill.

There are many different brands of progestogen pill, and they vary slightly in how
they should be used. Your doctor or nurse can explain to you exactly how to use the
one that you are using.

Some women stop having their monthly periods while using this type of pill. There
can be other side effects in some women, including:



changes in bleeding patterns




headaches




mood changes, and




tender breasts.


If you have unpleasant side effects, talk to your doctor about trying a different
brand.

Can hormonal contraception help with difficult periods?
Some women choose hormonal contraception methods, such as the pill, because they can
help with various problems they have with their periods. Combined hormonal contraception,
which contains oestrogen, seems to help the most.

These problems sometimes improve because women stop having periods completely when
using hormonal contraception. Or it can just ease they symptoms of various problems,
including:



heavy or irregular bleeding


premenstrual symptoms, such as headaches, bloating, and mood changes


endometriosis




menstrual migraines




anaemia caused by heavy bleeding




flares of rheumatoid arthritis during periods


acne




polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and




menopausal symptoms.


You can talk with your doctor about whether hormonal contraception might help you
with problems to do with your periods.

Why contraception matters
The number of unplanned pregnancies tells us how important it is for sexually active
people to think about contraception. For example:



in the UK about 30 in 100 pregnancies are unplanned, and

mean it’s unwanted.

But many unplanned pregnancies end in abortions, which can cause emotional distress,
and which carry physical health risks, such as infections.

The contraceptive pill can be very effective at preventing pregnancy, but it doesn’t
suit everyone.

But whatever method you choose, planning and taking responsibility for contraception
is vital if:



you are a sexually active girl or woman who could become pregnant, and you do not
wish to become pregnant





you are a sexually active male having sex with females of childbearing age, and you

IUDs are small devices that can be placed in your uterus (womb) to stop you becoming
pregnant. You need to have one fitted by a doctor or nurse.

You can use our information to talk to your doctor about whether an IUD is the right
type of contraception for you.

The right contraception for you
There are many types of contraception to choose from. But they are not all suitable
for everyone.

For example, women with heart conditions might not be able to take certain types of
contraceptive pill. And people allergic to latex won't be able to use latex condoms,
but can use non-latex condoms instead.

The type of contraception that suits you best will depend on several things including:


your medical history, including things like allergies and any health conditions that
you have



your lifestyle


whether you need to think about preventing sexually transmitted infections (STIs),
including HIV. For example, this applies to you if you have multiple partners, or
if you change partners, and



your own preferences: for example, you might not want to use some types of contraception
because you're concerned about side effects. Or maybe you don't want to use condoms
because you want something that you don't want to have to think about 'in the moment'.



What are intrauterine devices?
An IUD is a small device that is placed into your uterus (womb). Having one fitted
by a doctor or nurse takes about five minutes.

But not all doctors and nurses are trained to fit them. So you might have to go to
a special family planning clinic to have one fitted. For example, in the UK these
are called Sexual and Reproductive Health Clinics.

There are two types of IUD, which work in slightly different ways to stop you becoming
pregnant. They are:



the copper IUD (sometimes called the 'copper coil') and


the progestogen IUD.


IUDs are very effective in preventing pregnancy. Other advantages of IUDs include
that:



they are easily reversible. So if you decide you want to try to become pregnant,
you can have the IUD removed and start trying straight away



they are suitable for women who can't or don't want to use contraception methods that
contain hormones, such as some contraceptive pills and other devices



the progestogen IUD can help with heavy or painful periods, and


once your IUD is in place, you don't need to do anything else.


Possible disadvantages of IUDs include:


a small chance of getting an infection when the IUD is fitted


discomfort when the IUD is fitted, and


problems with your periods, especially with the copper IUD, and especially for the
first few months after the IUD is fitted, such as heavier or more painful periods.



There's also a chance that your body might push the IUD out. This is called 'expulsion'.
This happens in about 5 in every 100 women. It's more likely to happen:



in the first year after having it fitted


if you have never had children


if you have an IUD fitted soon after giving birth, and


if you have an IUD fitted soon after having an abortion.


The doctor or nurse who fits your IUD can tell you how to check if it's still in place.
IUDs don't protect against HIV or other STIs.
Copper IUDs
The copper IUD works by slowly releasing small amounts of copper into the womb. This
works to prevent pregnancy in several ways. The copper can:



kill sperm, and


stop a fertilised egg from implanting in the womb.


A copper IUD can stay in place for between five and 10 years. Your doctor or nurse
will tell you how long yours should last.

Copper IUDs can sometimes cause heavier, more painful periods, especially for the
first few months.

The copper IUD can also be used as a method of emergency contraception for several
days after having unprotected sex.

For more information on emergency contraception, see our leaflet: Contraception: emergency contraception.
Progestogen IUDs
The second type of IUD is the progestogen IUD. It's a similar device to the copper
version. But instead of releasing copper into the womb it releases hormones called
progestogens.

These hormones prevent pregnancy in several ways, including:


affecting the cervical mucus so that sperm can't travel along the cervix, and


thinning the lining of the womb.


A progestogen IUD can stay in place for between three and six years. Your doctor will
tell you how long yours will last.

This type of IUD can cause problems in some women, including:


skin changes


mood changes


bloating, and


breast tenderness.


These symptoms are usually mild and tend to settle down over time.
But the changes in hormones can also help some women, by easing the symptoms of heavy
menstrual bleeding and endometriosis.

For more information on some other types of contraception that use hormones, see our
leaflet: Contraception: hormonal patches, rings, implants, and injections.

Why contraception matters
The number of unplanned pregnancies tells us how important it is for sexually active
people to think about contraception. For example:



in the UK about 30 in 100 pregnancies are unplanned, and


in the US about 50 in 100 pregnancies are unplanned.


This is not always bad news, of course: just because a pregnancy is unplanned doesn't
mean it's not wanted.

IUDs are a highly effective method of contraception. But they don't suit everyone.
But whatever method you choose, planning and taking responsibility for contraception
is vital if:



you are a sexually active and want to play a responsible part in preventing an unwanted
pregnancy



you think that you might be at risk of HIV or other STIs (for example, if you have
multiple sexual partners) and you want to use a method of contraception that protects
against infection.

Like the contraceptive pill and some types of intrauterine device, these methods of
contraception all work by using hormones. You can talk to your doctor about whether
they might suit your lifestyle.

Some of these methods are not suitable for all women. Your doctor or nurse should
explain clearly who can and cannot use them.

The right contraception for you
There are many types of contraception to choose from, including the contraceptive
pill. But they are not all suitable for everyone.

For example, women with heart conditions might not be able to take the pill. And people
allergic to latex won't be able to use latex condoms.

The type of contraception that suits you best will depend on several things including:


your medical history, including things like allergies and any health conditions that
you have



your lifestyle


whether you need to think about preventing sexually transmitted infections (STIs),
including HIV. For example, this applies to you if you have multiple partners, or
if you change partners, and



your own preferences: for example, you might not want to use some types of contraception
because you're concerned about side effects. Or maybe you don't want to use condoms
because you want something that you don't want to have to think about 'in the moment'.



What is hormonal contraception?
Hormonal contraception means preventing pregnancy by taking extra amounts of hormones
that women's bodies produce naturally. When you take more of some hormones than the
body normally produces, it stops you getting pregnant.

These hormones work like this in several ways, including:


stopping your ovaries from releasing an egg each month


thickening the mucus (fluid) in your cervix so that it's harder for sperm to travel
through it, and



thickening the wall of the uterus (womb), so that it's harder for any fertilised egg
to implant there.



The best-known method of hormonal contraception is the oral contraceptive pill. To
learn more, see our leaflet Contraception: oral contraceptives (the pill).

Another well-known hormonal contraceptive device is the progestogen intrauterine device
(IUD). To learn more, see our leaflet Contraception: intrauterine devices (IUDs).

But there are several other ways of using hormones to prevent pregnancy that don't
involve taking pills. They are:



vaginal rings


skin patches


implants in the arm, and


injections.


These different methods mean that women can choose one that best suits their lifestyle.
And different hormonal methods of contraception use different hormones.



Skin patches and vaginal rings use a hormone called oestrogen along with a type of
hormone called a progestogen. These are called combined hormonal contraceptives.



Injections and implants use a progestogen hormone only.


None of these hormonal methods protects against HIV and other STIs.
Who can use combined hormonal contraceptives (contraceptives that contain oestrogen)?
Not all women can use combined hormonal contraception. This is because there is a
small chance that oestrogen can cause serious health problems for some women, including
strokes, heart attacks, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

Your doctor or nurse should explain carefully who can't use contraception that contains
oestrogen. But generally, you should not use combined contraception if you:



smoke


get migraines with 'aura' (such as flashing lights and problems with your vision)


have any history of heart disease


have had a stroke


have severe liver disease


have very high blood pressure


have ever had deep vein thrombosis.


Some women with diabetes might also not be able to use combined contraception.
Different hormonal contraception methods
The contraceptive implant
The contraceptive implant is a small device that is inserted into the upper arm by
a specially trained doctor. It gradually releases a progestogen hormone, which prevents
pregnancy in the same way as other hormonal contraception.

The implant does not contain oestrogen. So you can use it if you can't use contraception
that contains oestrogen.

There are two versions of it. One contains two small rods that contain the hormone,
while the other contains only one.

The two-rod version lasts 4 to 5 years, while the one-rod version lasts for 3 years.
But both versions are not available everywhere. If you live in the UK or US, you will
only be able to have the one-rod version.

The implant can cause side effects in some women, including:


irregular bleeding, or stopping having periods altogether


headaches


acne (although the implant can actually cause acne to improve in some women)


tummy pain


weight changes, and


mood changes.


If you decide you want to try to become pregnant, just have the implant removed and
your fertility will return to normal quickly.

Contraceptive injections
The contraceptive injection is a progestogen-only contraceptive method. So it's okay
to use it if you can't use a contraceptive that contains oestrogen.

You have an injection, usually in the upper arm, every three months. Like other hormonal
contraceptives, it's very effective.

The possible side effects are similar to those of other hormonal contraceptives. But
the injection can also cause a reduced sex drive in some women.

It can also weaken your bones slightly. So if you want to use this method over the
long term, you might need to make sure that you are eating a healthy diet and staying
active, to make sure your bones stay strong.

If you decide you want to try to become pregnant, it can take up to a year to become
fertile again after you stop having the injections.

The skin patch
The contraceptive skin patch is a combined hormonal contraceptive. This means that
it contains both oestrogen and a progestogen hormone.

The patch is very effective when used properly. You use it like this:


A pack of patches contains three patches.


You apply a patch to your skin and leave it there for a week.


You can put it on most places on your body, but not on your breasts, or where it might
get rubbed off by clothes.



Your body slowly and steadily absorbs the hormones in the patch.


You use one patch per week for three weeks.


You then have one week (week 4 of your menstrual cycle) without a patch.


Then you start again with a new pack of patches.


Your doctor or nurse should explain in detail how to use the patches, including what
to do if:



you leave one on for too long


a patch comes off by itself (this is rare. The patches are very sticky and they should
stay on even when you shower or swim), or



you forget to put one on after your week without a patch.


The patch can cause side effects in some women, including:


irregular bleeding


skin irritation


headaches, and


nausea.


In most women, the side effects improve or disappear after the first few months. If
they don't get better, talk to your doctor about trying a different type of patch.

The patch might not work as well in women who weigh more than 90 kilograms (about
200 pounds). If you weigh more than this amount, your doctor will probably recommend
that you use a different method of contraception.

The vaginal ring
The vaginal ring is a small, soft plastic ring that you insert into your vagina. Like
the patch, it is a combined hormonal contraceptive, which means it uses both oestrogen
and a progestogen hormone.

It works by slowly releasing the hormones into your vagina over several weeks. Like
the patch, it is very effective when used properly.

You leave the ring in for three weeks (21 days). Then you remove it for the last seven
days of your cycle.

Your doctor or nurse should discuss with you how exactly to use the ring, including
what to do if:



it falls out by itself


you forget to take it out after 21 days, or


you forget to put a new one in after your week with no ring.


The ring can cause side effects in some women, including:


irregular bleeding


increased vaginal discharge


tummy pain, and


breast pain.


These side effects usually stop after the first few months. If they don't stop, talk
to your doctor about trying a different type of ring.

Can hormonal contraception help with difficult periods?
Some women choose hormonal contraception, including the pill, because it can help
with various problems they have with their periods. Combined hormonal contraception,
which contains oestrogen, seems to help the most.

These problems sometimes improve because women stop having periods completely when
using hormonal contraception. Or it can just ease the symptoms of various problems,
including:



heavy or irregular bleeding


premenstrual symptoms, such as headaches, bloating, and mood changes


endometriosis


menstrual migraines


anaemia caused by heavy bleeding


flares of rheumatoid arthritis during periods


acne


polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and


menopausal symptoms.


You can talk to your doctor about whether hormonal contraception might help you with
problems to do with your periods.

Combined hormonal contraception also seems to reduce your chances of getting some
types of cancer.

Why contraception matters
The number of unplanned pregnancies tells us how important it is for sexually active
people to think about contraception. For example:



in the UK about 30 in 100 pregnancies are unplanned, and


in the US about 50 in 100 pregnancies are unplanned.

mean it's unwanted.

But many unplanned pregnancies end in abortions, which can cause emotional distress,
and sometimes physical health risks, such as infections.

Emergency contraception can usually prevent pregnancy if you use it within a few days
of having unprotected sex. There are several kinds.

You can talk to your doctor or pharmacist about which method is most suitable for
you, about contraception in general, and about how best to avoid emergency situations
in future.

What is emergency contraception?
Whether it’s the pill, condoms, or other methods, contraception is usually something
that you think about before you have sex.

But you use emergency contraception after you have sex. There are several reasons
why women might need it, including if:



another method of contraception has failed: for example, a condom has burst




you missed a day taking your pill or started a new pack later (check with your pharmacist
or doctor. You might still be protected with some types of pill)





you are concerned that you didn’t use your regular contraception properly: for example,
you forgot to replace a patch or a vaginal contraceptive ring in time (again, check
with your pharmacist or doctor to see if you’re still protected), or



you had unprotected sex for any reason.


None of the emergency contraception methods in this leaflet protect against HIV or
other sexually transmitted infections (STIs).

If you need emergency contraception after unprotected sex with a new partner, you
might want to think about being tested for STIs.

Different types of emergency contraception
There are several methods of emergency contraception:


Special contraceptive pills that you take after having sex. These are also known as
'morning after' pills, although they usually still work even if you take them a few
days after you have had sex.

There are two kinds of morning after pill. They are both available to buy without
prescription in many countries, including the UK. In some countries they are available
for free from family planning clinics and other health centres.





The copper intrauterine device (IUD).


The copper IUD
The copper IUD is the most effective method of emergency contraception and the one
that many doctors recommend.

The copper intrauterine device, or IUD, is usually used as a long-term method of contraception.
It is a small device that is fitted into your womb by a doctor or nurse. For more
information on the copper IUD, see our leaflet Contraception: intrauterine devices (IUDs).

The copper IUD can also work as emergency contraception if you have one fitted up
to five days after having unprotected sex. It works by stopping a fertilised egg from
implanting into the womb.

It can cause side effects, including changes to your normal bleeding patterns, such
as heavier bleeding.

Having a copper IUD fitted as emergency contraception usually means deciding that
you want to use it as your regular method of contraception for some time to come.


The morning after pill
There are two types of morning after pill:


One uses a type of hormone called a progestogen hormone. You might have heard of it by one of its brand names, although these vary by country.
Two of its brand names are Levonelle and Plan B.





The other uses a drug called ulipristal. It goes by various brand names, including Ella, Ellaone, Esmya, and Fibristal.



Morning after pills don’t work if a fertilised egg has already implanted in your womb
and you are already pregnant. So they don’t cause an abortion or miscarriage.

The progestogen hormone morning after pill (Levonelle, Plan B) works by stopping your ovaries from releasing an egg (ovulation).
It might also work by preventing a fertilised egg from implanting in the womb (uterus).
If a fertilised egg doesn’t implant in this way, it can’t develop into a fetus.

This method of emergency contraception works best if you use it within three days
after you have sex. It can sometimes work for up to five days. But the sooner you
use it after you have sex, the more likely it is to work.

It sometimes comes as a single pill, and sometimes as two pills, so that you take
one pill right away and the other one 12 hours later.

The main side effects of this pill are:


headaches




irregular periods




painful menstrual cramps, and




nausea. If you vomit within three hours of taking the pill, you might need to take
another for it to work. Ask your pharmacist or check the information leaflet that
comes with the pill.



You can start using your regular contraception method immediately after using this
pill. But you will need to use a barrier method as well, or to not have sex, for seven
days.

To make sure that the pill has worked, you should wait take a pregnancy test three
weeks after the last time you had unprotected sex.

The ulipristal morning after pill (Ella, Ellaone) works in a similar way to the progestogen hormone pill. But research
suggests that it might work better than the progestogen pill.

The main side effects of this pill are similar to those of the hormonal morning after
pill.

If your regular method of contraception is hormonal (such as the contraceptive pill
or any other method that uses hormones) you will need to wait five days after using
this pill before using your regular method again.

As with the progestogen pill, you will need to take a pregnancy test after a few weeks
to make sure it has worked.

Ulipristal is not suitable for women with severe asthma.
Why contraception matters
The number of unplanned pregnancies tells us how important it is for sexually active
people to think about contraception. For example:



in the UK about 30 in 100 pregnancies are unplanned, and




in the US about 50 in 100 pregnancies are unplanned.


This is not always bad news, of course. Just because a pregnancy is unplanned doesn’t
mean it’s unwanted.

But many unplanned pregnancies end in abortions, which can cause emotional distress,
and can have physical health risks, such as infections.

Emergency contraception can be very effective at preventing pregnancy after unprotected
sex, but it doesn’t always work. There are many other methods that give you greater
control and peace of mind.

Whatever method you choose, planning and taking responsibility for contraception is
vital if:



you are a sexually active girl or woman who could become pregnant, and you do not
wish to become pregnant





you are a sexually active male having sex with females of childbearing age, and you
wish to play a responsible part in avoiding an unwanted pregnancy





you think that you might be at risk of HIV or other STIs (for example, if you have
multiple sexual partners) and you want to use a method of contraception that protects
against infection.



Very few methods of contraception are totally effective. But planning gives you the
best chance of being in control of when and if you become pregnant.

Your doctor or practice nurse will be very happy to discuss contraception and family
planning methods that best suit you."

There are many types of contraception, all designed to help you plan when you do and
don't want to try to have children. You can use our information to talk to your doctor
about the type that's best for you.

This leaflet is about behavioural methods of contraception. This usually means that
you try to avoid pregnancy by how and when you have sex, rather than by using any
other methods, such as condoms or the contraceptive pill.

The right contraception for you
There are many types of contraception to choose from. But they are not all suitable
for everyone.

For example, women with heart conditions might not be able to take the contraceptive
pill. And people allergic to latex won't be able to use latex condoms.

The type of contraception that suits you best will depend on several things including:


your medical history, including things like allergies and any health conditions that
you have



your lifestyle


whether you need to think about preventing sexually transmitted infections (STIs),
including HIV. For example, this applies to you if you have multiple partners, or
if you change partners, and



your own preferences: for example, you might not want to use some types of contraception
because you're concerned about side effects. Or maybe you don't want to use condoms
because you want something that you don't want to have to think about 'in the moment'.



What are behavioural methods of contraception?
Behavioural contraception means that you don't use any medications, such as the contraceptive
pill, or barrier methods, such as condoms.

Instead, you try to avoid pregnancy by how and when you have sex.
With perfect use, some behavioural methods can be very effective. However, with normal
everyday use, they tend to be less effective than other types of contraception.

Different behavioural contraception methods
Breastfeeding
You might have heard that it's not possible for a woman to become pregnant as long
as she is breastfeeding. This is partly true.

More accurately, it is not usually possible for a woman to become pregnant while breastfeeding
in the first months after she has a baby. This is because it can take a while before
a woman starts to have menstrual periods again after giving birth.

You might have heard this method of contraception called the lactational amenorrhoea method, or LAM.

For this method of contraception to work, you need to make sure that:


you only feed your baby by breastfeeding, and


you breastfeed your baby at least every 4 hours during the day, and at least every
6 hours during the night.



This method of contraception is very effective when you follow these rules. But you
can only do it for a short time. You need to start using another method of contraception
when:



your baby is six months old, or


you start having periods again, or


your baby starts to eat some solid food, because this means that he or she is breastfeeding
less.



Not having sex when ovulating (also called the rhythm method)
It's only possible for a woman to become pregnant on certain days during her menstrual
cycle. This time is called ovulation. It is when an egg is released from the woman's
ovary and is ready to be fertilised by a man's sperm.

Some women try to avoid pregnancy by:


avoiding sex on days when they are ovulating, or


using barrier contraception on those days.


Generally, women avoid sex or use barrier methods from five days before ovulation
to two days after.

(For more information on barrier contraception, see our leaflet: Contraception: barrier methods.)

Using this method means predicting exactly when you will be ovulating. There are several
ways of doing this. You can:



check your body temperature first thing in the morning. Your temperature will drop
slightly below normal a couple of days before you ovulate, and will rise slightly
above normal for 10 to 14 days after you ovulate.

To use this method, you will first need to track your temperature for a few months,
at the same time every morning, to get to know what your normal morning temperature
is.



check your cervical mucus. This is the fluid that's always in your cervix. When you
are ovulating, the mucus in your cervix will be clear coloured and have a thinner
texture.

When you are not ovulating, the mucus will be sticky, and cloudy or yellowish. This
usually happens just after your period. Some women have vaginal dryness during these
times.



chart your menstrual cycles on a calendar. To use this method, you need to know how
long your menstrual cycle lasts (not all women's cycles last 28 days: some are shorter
and some longer).

You can then work out when you should be ovulating. Ovulation usually happens about
14 days before your period starts.



You can ask your doctor for more information about any of these methods. There is
also plenty of information online, including ovulation calculators, to help you tell
when you are ovulating.

Doing more than one of these things makes the rhythm method more effective. Used properly,
this method can be effective almost all of the time.

But you need to use it consistently and carefully for it to work. And it probably
won't work well for women whose periods don’t happen at regular, predictable intervals.

Withdrawal
Withdrawal means that the man withdraws (takes out) his penis from the woman's vagina
before he ejaculates (comes). For this method to work, the man needs to be able to
tell when he is about to ejaculate, and to withdraw his penis in time, every time.

This method can be effective much of the time. But even if you are careful it is risky,
because some sperm can leak from the penis before ejaculation.

Why contraception matters
The number of unplanned pregnancies tells us how important it is for sexually active
people to think about contraception. For example:



in the UK about 30 in 100 pregnancies are unplanned, and


in the US about 50 in 100 pregnancies are unplanned.


This is not always bad news, of course: just because a pregnancy is unplanned doesn't
mean it's not wanted.

But many unplanned pregnancies end in abortions, which can cause emotional distress,
and which carry physical health risks, such as infections.

Behavioural methods of contraception can be effective. But they require a lot of care
and planning.

But whatever method you choose, planning and taking responsibility for contraception
is vital if:



you are a sexually active girl or woman who could become pregnant, and you do not
wish to become pregnant



you are a sexually active male having sex with females of childbearing age, and you
wish to play a responsible part in avoiding an unwanted pregnancy



you think that you might be at risk of HIV or other STIs (for example, if you have
multiple sexual partners) and you want to use a method of contraception that protects
against infection.



Very few methods of contraception are totally effective. But planning gives you the
best chance of being in control of when and if you become pregnant.

There are many types of contraception, all designed to help you plan when you do and
don't want to try to have children. You can use our information to talk to your doctor
about the type that's best for you.

This leaflet is about barrier contraception. That means using a physical barrier (such
as a condom) or spermicide to stop the man's sperm from reaching the woman's egg.

The right contraception for you
There are many types of contraception to choose from. But they are not all suitable
for everyone.

For example, women with heart conditions might not be able to take the contraceptive
pill. And people allergic to latex won't be able to use latex condoms.

because you're concerned about side effects. Or maybe you don't want to use condoms
because you want something that you don't want to have to think about 'in the moment'.



What is barrier contraception?
There are several types of barrier contraception. They are called that because they
use a physical barrier, such as a condom, or chemicals called spermicide, to stop
the man's sperm from reaching the woman's egg.

What is barrier contraception?
Although barrier contraception is less effective at preventing pregnancy than some
other methods, it is popular with many people for other reasons. For example:



condoms and spermicide are available without a prescription


most types of condom protect against HIV and other STIs


all barrier methods are safe to use while breastfeeding


some women don't want to take the contraceptive pill because of worries about side
effects



some women who use another contraceptive method, such as the pill, also use barrier
methods to prevent STIs.



However, in order to work as well as possible, barrier methods need to be used properly
and carefully.

Different barrier contraception methods
The diaphragm and cervical cap
The diaphragm and the cervical cap are circular domes made of soft, stretchy silicone.
The cap is slightly smaller than the diaphragm, but they both do the same job, which
is to stop sperm from getting from the vagina into the cervix.

You will need to see your doctor before starting to use this type of contraception.
A doctor or nurse will explain how to use it.

Before having sex, you coat and fill the cap or diaphragm with spermicide foam or
gel, then insert it into your vagina. If you have sex again within six hours, you
will need to use more spermicide using a special applicator.

When used properly, the cap and diaphragm prevent pregnancy about 85 times in 100.
So you can see that they're not perfect. But this figure is just an average: it's
not possible to say how successful these methods are for individual women.

Possible side effects and disadvantages of the diaphragm and cap include:


skin irritation in some women


a greater chance of bladder infection (cystitis) with the diaphragm (but not with
the cap), and



possibly a greater chance of HIV infection. The diaphragm and cap do not protect against
HIV. And it's possible that frequent use of spermicide can actually make HIV infection
more likely.



The female condom
The female condom is a lubricated pouch made of a soft material a bit like the latex
that male condoms are made of. You insert it into your vagina before sex. Like male
condoms, you use a new one each time you have sex.

When used properly, the female condom is effective in preventing pregnancy up to 95
times in 100, and it can prevent HIV and other STIs.

Possible side effects and disadvantages include:


rubbing (friction) and noise during sex


some loss of sexual feeling (sensation)


more chance of slipping or breaking compared with the male condom.


The male condom
When used properly, the male condom can prevent pregnancy up to 98 times in 100. You
need to use a new condom each time you have sex.

Most condoms are made of either latex or polyurethane. Both types can prevent HIV
and other STIs. Male condoms can also help prevent early ejaculation, because they
cause some loss of sexual feeling.

There are some side effects and disadvantages of male condoms:


People with a latex allergy cannot use this type of condom. Check the packaging to
see what that type of condom is made of.



Condoms cause some loss of sexual feeling for the man.


Male condoms can sometimes slip off or break during sex.


Oil-based lubricants such as vaseline can weaken latex condoms and cause them to break.


Spermicide
Spermicide is a chemical that kills sperm and stops a woman becoming pregnant. The
woman applies it inside her vagina before having sex.

You need to insert more spermicide each time you have sex. When used properly, spermicide
can prevent pregnancy up to about 88 times in 100.

Possible disadvantages and side effects include:


skin irritation, and


a possibly increased chance of HIV.


Why contraception matters
The number of unplanned pregnancies tells us how important it is for sexually active
people to think about contraception. For example:



in the UK about 30 in 100 pregnancies are unplanned, and


in the US about 50 in 100 pregnancies are unplanned.


This is not always bad news, of course: just because a pregnancy is unplanned doesn't
mean it's not wanted.

But many unplanned pregnancies end in abortions, which can cause emotional distress,
and which carry physical health risks, such as infections.

Barrier methods of contraception are not always the most effective. But many of them
can protect against HIV and other STIs.

Whatever method you choose, planning and taking responsibility for contraception is
vital if:



you are a sexually active girl or woman who could become pregnant, and you do not
wish to become pregnant



you are a sexually active male having sex with females of childbearing age, and you
wish to play your part in avoiding an unwanted pregnancy



you think that you might be at risk of HIV or other STIs (for example, if you have
multiple sexual partners) and you want to use a method of contraception that protects
against infection.

Most children get constipated from time to time. But children who have constipation
that doesn't go away may need treatment to get back to normal.

What happens if my child is constipated?
If your child is constipated they don't pass a stool ('poo') often enough. And, when
your child does go, it hurts because the stools are hard and dry. Most children with
constipation don't have anything physically wrong with them. Usually they've just
got into the habit of not going very often.

Common reasons that children become constipated include:


They've found passing a stool painful before


They find toilet training stressful


They don't like using toilets outside their home, such as at school or nursery


They don't have enough fibre in their diet


Emotional problems.


What are the symptoms?
There aren't any rules about how often your child should pass a stool. Every child
is different.

For example, young babies may pass stool many times a day, especially if they are
breastfed. By the time children are 3 or 4 years old they may pass stool between 3
or 4 times a week and 3 or 4 times a day.

But if your child passes a stool twice a week or less, and finds it painful, it's
a sign that they could be constipated, especially if they also have some of these
symptoms:



Pain when passing stools


Soiling of underwear or clothes (this is called overflow faecal incontinence)


Small, dry, and hard stools like pellets. When these collect in the rectum and anus
and don't come out easily, this is called faecal impaction



Avoiding going to the toilet.


What treatments work?
Usually constipation lasts a few days and clears up without any treatment. But in
some children it doesn't go away. If you're worried about your child's constipation,
see your doctor. The problem can get worse if you wait. Treatments can help, but it
can take a while for them to work.

Things you can do for your child
Giving your child food with lots of fibre is likely to help with constipation. Your
child is likely to have more bowel movements and less pain in their abdomen.

Here are some ways to help your child get more fibre:


If they eat breakfast cereals, make sure they're whole grain


Give them fruit, such as apples, instead of fruit juice


Give them brown rice and whole-grain bread and pasta instead of the white kinds


Encourage them to eat high-fibre snacks, such as raw carrots.


Your doctor may also recommend these steps to help keep your child's bowels healthy:


Encourage your child to go to the toilet when they first get the urge, rather than
to wait



Set aside enough time for your child to sit on the toilet without feeling rushed


Make sure your child gets lots of active play


Make sure your child sits properly on the toilet and try to get them to relax


If your child says that it hurts to 'poo', tell him or her to stop, and to try again
later.



Medicines
If extra fibre hasn't worked your doctor may recommend a laxative. There are several
types. Research has found that laxatives that make stools softer can help. Doctors
call these osmotic laxatives and they will probably help your child pass a stool more often.

Your child is likely to have more frequent bowel movements and feel less pain. This
type of laxative is also used if a child's bowels get completely blocked with large,
hard stools (known as impacted faeces).

You can buy some of these laxatives from a pharmacy without a prescription. But if
your child has ongoing constipation it's best to see your doctor before using this
treatment. Some over-the-counter medicines have age restrictions. Check with your
pharmacist to make sure they're suitable for your child.

There are other types of laxative, but we don't know as much about how well they work
for children who have constipation.

Laxatives can have side effects. But usually these aren't serious. Your child may
feel thirsty or get stomach cramps, wind (flatulence), belching, bloating, nausea,
or mild diarrhoea. Your child may get fewer side effects from a laxative that makes
stools softer.

Non-drug treatments
For slightly older children (probably those at least 18 months old) there are some
treatments that can help them understand and change their toilet habits.

Toilet training for children with constipation means teaching your child which muscles to relax and tighten when having a bowel movement,
so that it's easier to pass stools. Your child might be taught to sit on a toilet,
relax their legs and feet, take a deep breath while sitting up straight, then push
down while still holding their breath and pulling in their stomach muscles to help
push stools out.

You could also try having regular toilet times that are calm and unhurried, such as
after breakfast or before bedtime.

You can use a diary to record your child's eating habits and when they pass stools.
You might write down when your child eats an apple or sits on the toilet, for example.
You can use this as part of a reward system. The child gets a reward for habits that
might help them stay regular.

There's not much good-quality research to show if these treatments can help if they
are used on their own. But doctors sometimes suggest toilet training in addition to
laxatives.

What will happen to my child?
Most children get constipation from time to time. Usually it lasts just a few days.
But for some children the constipation doesn't get better. If it's not treated properly
it can get worse.

Your child is more likely to get better if the constipation is treated early. Your
child is more likely to get long-lasting constipation if they are constipated while
very young and if constipation is common in your family."

Being constipated can make you feel uncomfortable. Eating more fibre, drinking more
fluids, and taking some gentle exercise might help. If that doesn't help, there could
be something else causing your symptoms.

You can use our information to talk to your doctor or pharmacist and decide which
treatments are right for you.

A sign of something else?
Constipation is very common and is not usually serious. But sometimes it can be a
sign of another, sometimes more serious condition. If you have symptoms that come
on suddenly, or if you have other worrying features, your doctor may want to do some
tests to rule out other causes, such as colon cancer.

You should see your doctor if you have any of the following symptoms alongside constipation,
or if you have constipation and you are over 50 years old:



Rectal bleeding. Blood in stools is usually caused by piles (haemorrhoids). But it
can sometimes be a sign of a more serious condition.



Sudden weight loss


Constipation that came on suddenly


A feeling that something is blocking or obstructing your stools


Rectal prolapse (this is when part of your rectum sticks out through your anus)


Change in the thickness and shape of your stools.


What is constipation?
If you have constipation you have difficulty passing stools, or you don't pass a stool
very often, or your stools are very hard. It is very common.

In most people constipation is not a sign of anything serious and can usually be treated
with some simple lifestyle changes. This information is about constipation not linked
to another condition.

What are the symptoms?
It's hard to say exactly when someone is constipated. Bowel habits vary a lot, and
people have different ideas about what's normal. Your bowel movements becoming less
frequent is often the best way of telling if you're constipated.

Constipation is often linked to not eating enough fibre, not drinking enough fluids,
and not taking enough exercise. Sometimes medicines and supplements can cause constipation,
so be sure to tell your doctor if you are taking any.

If you have constipation:


you find passing a stool difficult or uncomfortable, even though you go to the toilet
fairly regularly, or



you don't pass a stool often enough.


You may also find that your stools are hard or lumpy. You may feel that your bowels
aren't completely empty after going to the toilet. Sometimes there are other symptoms,
such as stomach pain or feeling bloated or tired.

Constipation is very common. But if it lasts longer than a few weeks you should see
your doctor.

Your doctor will probably be able to diagnose constipation by asking you about your
symptoms. Most people don't need any tests for constipation. You'll need tests only
if your doctor wants to make sure there isn't something more serious that's causing
your symptoms.

What treatments work?
The treatments for constipation depend on what your doctor thinks might be causing
it.

Constipation caused by medicines or by another condition
Constipation can be a symptom of another medical condition, such as Parkinson's disease
or irritable bowel syndrome, or it can happen during pregnancy. Constipation can also
be caused by colon cancer. So it's important to get it checked out.

Another common cause is certain medications, so it's important to tell your doctor
about any medicines or supplements you are taking. If your constipation is caused
by medications, your doctor may be able to prescribe other treatments instead.

If your constipation is caused by being pregnant your doctor will probably suggest
that you try eating a high-fibre diet and possibly try taking laxatives. He or she might also suggest that you stop taking iron supplements if you are taking
them.

Fibre makes stools bulkier and softer. High-fibre foods include:



bran


root vegetables


nuts


fresh or dried fruit


wholemeal cereals, and


wholemeal bread and wholemeal pasta.



Constipation with no obvious other cause
If your constipation is not caused by another condition or by a medication, the treatment
your doctor suggests might depend on how long you have had your symptoms.

Constipation that comes on slowly or has been going on for a long time, and that doesn't
have a specific medical cause, can usually be treated by some simple changes to your
lifestyle. For example, you should:



add more fibre to your diet


try to do some exercise every day: for example, walking or running. Many people find
that this helps, especially if they are not usually very active.



make sure you drink plenty of fluids. This should make your stools heavier and more
slippery.



Constipation that does not improve
If changes to your lifestyle don't help enough, you may need to take laxatives as
well. You can buy some types from a pharmacy without a prescription. But you should
see your doctor if you need to take them for longer than two weeks.

There are two types of laxative that people usually try first. These are bulk-forming laxatives and stool softeners. If you have hard stools then stool softeners may be more suitable for you. If you
sometimes have loose stools in between periods of constipation, you may find that
bulk-forming laxatives are more helpful.

If you would prefer a natural laxative prunes work well for many people. This is because they contain a lot of fibre.

If your symptoms don't improve after about 6 weeks your doctor might recommend a stronger,
prescription laxative. There are several types. Some are not suitable for pregnant
women and some can cause side effects in some people, such as headaches, nausea, and
diarrhoea.

Your doctor should talk to you about who these drugs are suitable for and about side
effects before you start taking them.

Constipation caused by muscle problems (dyssynergia)
Some people have a condition called dyssynergia. This means that some of their muscles
don't work in a regular, predictable way. Dyssynergia that involves the muscles around
the anus can cause problems with passing stools, including constipation.

If you have dyssynergia you might be offered a treatment called biofeedback training. This treatment helps you gain control over physical processes that are causing you
problems, including muscle problems such as dyssynergia.

You will have sessions with a therapist who will help you understand how your muscles
work and how to control them better. Most people with dyssynergia find that their
symptoms improve with biofeedback training.

Long-term problems
People with severe constipation that doesn't improve with any of the treatments listed
above may be able to have surgery. But this is usually a last resort.

There are several types of surgery including colectomy and caecostomy. Colectomy involves
removing part of the colon in order to make passing stools easier. Caecostomy involves
removing anything that is causing an obstruction in the bowel.

What will happen to me?
Most constipation lasts for just a few days. If it lasts longer there are treatments
that can help. Changes to your lifestyle and laxatives when needed are effective in
most people.

Constipation rarely becomes serious. But if it doesn't go away and is left untreated
it can lead to complications including anal fissures (tears in the skin of the anus),
haemorrhoids, and faecal impaction (hard stools that won't pass). So it's important
to get treatment if the problem continues."

If your eyes look red and feel gritty, you might have conjunctivitis. If your eyes
don't start to feel better after a day or two you should see your doctor, pharmacist,
or optician, because it can occasionally be a sign of a more serious problem.

What is conjunctivitis?
Conjunctivitis is an infection of your conjunctiva, the thin lining that covers the
inside of your eyelids and the whites of your eyes.

Conjunctivitis can be caused by bacteria or viruses, or it can be an allergic reaction
to things such as dust, sand, and pollen. It can also sometimes be caused by other
things, such as exposure to certain chemicals, and problems with contact lenses.

Viral and bacterial conjunctivitis spread easily from person to person. They are common
among school children. Adults are more likely to get conjunctivitis if they have very
dry eyes.

Conjunctivitis usually clears up on its own after a few days. But painful, red eyes
can sometimes be a sign of more serious eye problems, such as glaucoma (raised pressure
inside the eye), or an infection in your eyelid.

What are the symptoms?
Symptoms of conjunctivitis include watery, red, or sore eyes. Your eyes may feel gritty
and irritated, stinging, or burning. If you also have white or yellow pus coming from
your eyes, which causes crusts on your eyelids while you sleep, you probably have
a bacterial infection.

Your eyes may also itch. This could be a sign of an allergic infection. If you get
several attacks in a short space of time, your symptoms might be caused by an allergy,
or by re-infection (an infection that is cured and then comes back). If you get conjunctivitis
symptoms every year at the same time, it's probably due to an allergy.

You should see a doctor straight away if:


You have pain inside your eye


There is any sudden change in your vision, or


Light makes your eyes hurt.


These may be signs of a more serious problem.
If you wear contact lenses and you get the symptoms of conjunctivitis, take your contact
lenses out and see your doctor. Conjunctivitis needs to be treated quickly if you
wear contact lenses. This is because it can cause a more serious eye infection called
keratitis.

You should see a doctor straight away if your baby has the symptoms of conjunctivitis.
Some bacteria that cause conjunctivitis can cause other serious infections in babies.

Tests to diagnose conjunctivitis
Although there are tests that can tell what is causing your conjunctivitis, doctors
don't usually do them. This is because the problem usually clears up before the test
results would come back. Some doctors treat everyone with conjunctivitis with antibiotic
eye drops or ointment. Other doctors treat conjunctivitis with antibiotics only if
they think it's caused by bacteria.

What treatments work?
Conjunctivitis often clears up on its own. If it doesn't, then the treatment your
doctor suggests may depend on what has caused your conjunctivitis.

Allergic conjunctivitis
Mild symptoms
If you have conjunctivitis symptoms at the same time every year, they are probably
caused by an allergy, possibly to pollen. If your symptoms are mild, cold compresses can help relieve the symptoms, as can artificial tears. Artificial tears are lubricant eye drops that are usually used by people who have
very dry eyes. They can help wash away the irritants that cause allergic conjunctivitis.

Moderate symptoms
For symptoms that are too bad to be called mild, but not bad enough to be called severe,
there are several treatments that can help.

Antihistamines are medicines that treat allergies. Your doctor might suggest antihistamine eye drops
and possibly also antihistamine tablets. Your doctor might also suggest eye drops
that contain drugs called mast cell stabilisers. These drugs treat allergies in a similar way to antihistamines.

Eye drops containing drugs called vasoconstrictors can reduce the symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis, but they are not suitable for
everyone. For example, people with glaucoma (raised pressure inside the eye) and children
under 12 should not use them.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) also come as eye drops. These drugs help reduce inflammation (swelling) in the eyes,
that can affect some people with allergic conjunctivitis.

Severe symptoms
People with severe allergic conjunctivitis have symptoms all year round and tend to
have more swelling in and around the eyes. If you have severe symptoms your doctor
might refer you to an eye specialist.

One treatment that can reduce bad swelling is eye drops containing steroids (their full name is corticosteroids). These can be used together with antihistamines
and mast cell stabilisers.

But steroids shouldn't be used for long periods as they can cause serious side effects,
including delayed healing of wounds in the eyes, eye infections, raised pressure in
the eyes, and cataracts.

Drops containing ciclospirin may be an option if other treatments don't work well enough. This drug works by reducing
how well your immune system works. This means that your body doesn't have such a severe
allergic reaction to the thing that is causing your symptoms.

Treatments for bacterial conjunctivitis
Conjunctivitis caused by bacteria usually clears up on its own. But antibiotic eye drops can help it clear up more quickly. Your doctor may recommend them if your symptoms
are severe and causing you a lot of discomfort.

Bacterial conjunctivitis can sometimes be caused by the sexually transmitted infections
gonorrhoea and chlamydia. If you have this type of conjunctivitis your doctor will
prescribe antibiotic tablets as well as eye drops.

Treatments for viral conjunctivitis
There is no specific treatment for conjunctivitis caused by a virus (and without tests
you may never find out that your symptoms are virus related). But viral conjunctivitis
usually clears up on its own after a few days. Many of the treatments that help with
allergic conjunctivitis also help with the symptoms of viral conjunctivitis in the
meantime.

Treatments for conjunctivitis caused by other things
Contact lenses can sometimes cause conjunctivitis by irritating the eyes or by introducing germs.
If this happens to you, you should see your doctor right away. This is because conjunctivitis
caused by contact lenses can sometimes lead to a more serious infection called keratitis.

Your doctor will tell you that you should stop wearing your lenses for at least two
weeks. He or she might prescribe a short course of steroid eye drops or of antibiotic
eye drops.

If you get conjunctivitis after using re-usable contact lenses, it's a good idea to
switch to single-use lenses.

Exposure to some chemicals can sometimes irritate the eyes and cause symptoms of conjunctivitis. You should
wash your eyes thoroughly if this happens, or if chemicals of any kind splash into
your eyes. If the symptoms don't improve your doctor may prescribe treatments such
as steroid drops or artificial tears.

Some medications can cause an allergic reaction that can irritate the eyes. The problem should gradually
go away once you stop taking the medicine that's causing the problems: for example,
if your doctor is able to prescribe a different medicine.

Conjunctivitis and hygiene
Some basic hygiene steps can help relieve your symptoms and reduce the chance of spreading
conjunctivitis (if it's bacterial or viral) to other people.

Hold a clean cloth soaked in warm water to your eyes (keep them closed). Don't let
anyone else use this cloth. Wash your hands often and don't share towels or pillows.

If you think you have conjunctivitis because of an allergy, try to find out what causes
the allergy so you can try to stay away from it.

What will happen to me?
Most people who have conjunctivitis recover completely in two to five days without
needing any treatment. It's rare for conjunctivitis to cause serious problems."

Concussion is an injury to the brain, usually caused by a blow to the head.
Most people recover after a few days or weeks of rest. But some people need to be
monitored in hospital for a while, and there can be long-term effects.

What is concussion?
Concussion (doctors call it mild traumatic brain injury) is an injury to the brain,
usually caused by a direct blow to the head.

Concussion can also be caused by violent shaking, or by a sudden jolt. This type of
jolt is common in vehicle accidents.

A single episode of concussion usually gets better after a few weeks or days. But
repeated concussions can lead to long-term problems, including problems with concentration
and memory, and dementia.

For example, some sports, such as boxing and football, involve repeated blows to the head, which can cause
severe long-term problems.

But even single episodes of concussion can cause problems that can last for several
months, including:



headaches


dizziness and vertigo


problems with memory and concentration, and


depression and anxiety.


What are the symptoms?
Bumping your head is common. But, while it can be extremely painful, it doesn’t usually
cause concussion. Signs that you might have concussion include:



a headache that doesn’t go away, even with painkillers


dizziness or a feeling of unsteadiness (doctors call this vertigo). For example, you might feel clumsy when you walk



a sense of feeling separated from your body. For example, you might not feel 'connected'
to your arms and legs. Doctors call this depersonalisation


fatigue (feeling tired)


memory problems


nausea and vomiting. This is more common in children with concussion


neck pain. This is more common in vehicle accidents than with a blow to the head


problems thinking clearly. For example, you might struggle to remember some words,
solve problems, make plans, or pay attention for long.



If you, or your child, have symptoms like these after a head injury of any kind, get medical help right away.

It’s important to remember that you could have a brain injury even if you feel okay.
For example, a brain injury is more likely if you:



have fallen from a height or have any kind of 'high-energy' injury


have a history of bleeding problems, or


are taking blood-thinning medication.


If you are concerned or in any doubt, seek medical help right away.
Diagnosing concussion
Diagnosing concussion can be complicated, as a head injury often happens at the same
time as other injuries.

For example, if you were involved in a vehicle accident or a fall, you might have
injuries on several parts of your body.

So medical staff will want to check on any other serious problems. For example, they
will check you for possible breathing problems and injuries to your spine. They will also want to find out if you lost consciousness (blacked out) and, if so, for how long.

If you are conscious, the medical staff will then ask you questions about how you
are feeling and what you remember. From your answers, and from the way you answer,
they will usually be able to tell if you have concussion.

Your doctor might also want to do a scan of your head, such as an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), CT (computerised tomography),
or x-ray, to check for any dangerous bleeding or skull fractures.

What treatments are available?
Medicines
For many people, the only treatment they will need is to rest and take things easy
for a week or two, and to take painkillers as needed.

You might find that paracetamol helps. But your doctor might recommend stronger painkillers. It’s important to treat your pain for your own comfort, and to help relieve the
pressure in your head.

Your doctor might also suggest a drug to help with nausea and vomiting. These medicines
are called anti-emetics. These can be especially useful in children with concussion, who are more likely
to be affected by nausea.

If your doctor thinks that you might have dangerous bleeding around the brain, he or she might recommend medicine to stop you from bleeding too
easily. This is usually given as an intravenous infusion (an IV drip).

Monitoring in hospital
Most people with concussion don’t need to stay in hospital for long. But your doctor
might want to keep you in for a while if:



you are having severe headaches or are vomiting


your scans or tests suggest that you need to be monitored


you have have other injuries, or


you are intoxicated with alcohol or drugs.


Advice and information
If you (or your child) don’t need to stay in hospital, your doctor or nurse should
advise you on what to do to help you recover at home, or if you feel you need to seek
more medical help.

For example, you should return to the accident and emergency department right away
if you have:



weakness in one or more of your limbs


a feeling of weakness in your face


headaches or vomiting that don’t stop


trouble staying awake


bleeding from the nose or ears, or


agitation or confusion.


Your doctor should advise you (or your child) to stay with a responsible adult for
24 hours after you go home.

What to expect in the future?
There is no set time for how long it takes to recover from concussion. But it’s likely
to be at least a week or two before you can return to work and other normal activities.

You should leave it even longer before you play any sports, especially contact sports that might involve a blow to the head, or being hit on
the head by a ball. You should talk to your doctor about when and whether it’s safe
for you to return to these activities.

Even after you are pretty well recovered, some of your symptoms might linger for a
while. For example, you might have headaches more often than you used to for a while,
or feel tired or 'fuzzy' sometimes.

Some people are more likely than others to have long-term problems. For example, people
with a history of migraines or of frequent headaches tend to take longer to recover from concussion.

To give yourself the best chance of a quick and full recovery:


be on the lookout for symptoms that don’t get better


avoid stress


rest as much as you need to, and


use painkillers if you need to. Being in pain will slow your recovery. But you should
never take more than the recommended dose of any painkillers. If your pain medicine
isn’t helping, talk to your doctor."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1522069571920/Common%20cold,Common cold,"Common cold Last published: Dec 06, 2021
A cold may last only a few days, but it can make you uncomfortable and exhausted.
There's no cure, but there are things that may help you feel better.

What happens?
A common cold is an infection of your nose and upper airways, caused by a virus. Lots
of different viruses can cause a cold.

Sneezing spreads the virus in tiny droplets through the air, and onto surfaces such
as door handles, where people pick it up on their hands.

Children get more colds than adults. Each year, most children get about five colds,
and most adults get two or three.

What are the symptoms?
Colds often start with a sore throat. Soon, you start sneezing and get a runny nose.
You may get a headache and chills. Young children may get a fever.

Later, you'll probably get a blocked nose. The blood vessels in your nose swell up,
and the mucus from your nose can get thick and green. Symptoms are usually at their
worst after about 3 days.

You may get a dry cough that keeps you awake at night. Later on, you might cough up
mucus. About half of people with a cold get muscle aches and pains. You may feel tired
and irritable, or lose your appetite.

The symptoms are similar to some flu symptoms, but flu is more serious. If you have
flu, you're likely to get ill suddenly, have a fever, and feel so weak you cannot
get out of bed.

What treatments work?
There's no cure for the common cold. Symptoms usually go after a few days. And there
are lots of things you can try to make yourself feel better.

Things you can do for yourself
The aim of these treatments is to make you feel better while you recover from your
cold. You may want to rest more, keep warm, and drink plenty of fluids. Hot drinks
can be comforting.

People often try breathing in steam to clear a blocked nose. A warm shower or bath
may help clear your nose.

Some people take extra vitamin C when they have a cold. There is some evidence that it might help your cold clear
up a little faster, or that your symptoms might be milder. But the difference, if
any, is likely to be small.

Taking vitamin C doesn't seem to prevent people catching colds in the first place.
Medicines
Cold remedies include:


painkillers


decongestants


antihistamines, and


cough medicines.


These remedies should not usually be taken by children under six years old. Talk to
your doctor or pharmacist before you give any medicines to a young child.

Aches and pains can be treated with painkillers including paracetamol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen,
and aspirin.

Many cold remedies contain paracetamol, so check the labels to make sure you don’t
take more than the stated dose.

Note: children under 18 should not take aspirin.
Decongestants can help unblock your nose for several hours, but some people should not take decongestants.
Ask your doctor or pharmacist if they're suitable for you.

Some cold remedies contain antihistamines, which are medicines usually used to treat allergies. Some of these may help with
sneezing and a runny nose. But newer, 'non-drowsy' antihistamines don't seem to work.


Some cough medicines are meant to stop you coughing, while others aim to help you cough up mucus. But
there isn't much good evidence about how well they work.

Antibiotics don't work for the viruses that cause colds - antibiotics kill bacteria, not viruses.

Antibiotics also have side effects and, when wrongly used, they can increase the number
of germs in circulation that don’t respond to antibiotics anymore. This is called
'antibiotic resistance'.

What will happen to me?
Your cold will probably clear up after 7 to 10 days. If you're no better after a week
or so, or if you're worried about an old or young person with a cold, talk to a doctor.

Some people get other infections after a cold. These include ear infections, chest
infections, and infection of the sinuses. Chest infections can be serious, especially
in babies and older people. See your doctor if you are concerned."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/3000198/Colonoscopy,Colonoscopy,"Colonoscopy Last published: Jul 03, 2020
A colonoscopy is a test that allows a doctor to look inside your bowel. This information
covers how and why it’s done, any risks involved, and what to expect afterwards.

You can use our information to talk with your doctor if you have any questions about
having this test.

What is a colonoscopy?
Some medical conditions affect the lower part of your digestive system, including
the rectum and colon (you might hear it called your bowel). A colonoscopy is a test
that allows a doctor to look inside your rectum and colon for possible problems.

During a colonoscopy, a doctor inserts a tube with a camera on the end (a colonoscope)
into your anus and passes it up through your rectum and colon.

If your doctor sees anything unusual during the test, he or she can take samples of
tissue to look at more closely. This is called a biopsy.

Why might I need a colonoscopy?
The main reason for having a colonoscopy is if you have been having symptoms that
suggest a problem with your colon.

The main symptoms that suggest a problem are:


blood in your stool (poo) when you go to the toilet. You might notice blood in the
toilet bowl, on the toilet paper, or covering the stool



a change in your bowel habits, such as having bowel movements more often each day
or having diarrhoea



having constipation that doesn’t get better, along with other symptoms.


A colonoscopy can check for signs of conditions such as:


cancer of the colon or rectum (sometimes called bowel cancer)


Crohn’s disease, which causes inflammation (swelling) in the digestive system


diverticulitis, which causes small pouches to appear in the digestive tract. These
can sometimes become infected or swollen



diverticular disease, where tiny pouches in the colon wall can sometimes cause pain
and discomfort



ulcerative colitis, which causes inflammation and ulcers in the colon


polyps, which are small lumps on the inside of your bowel. Polyps are not cancer,
but they can sometimes turn into cancer. So it’s best to remove them when they’re
found.



Just because you have some symptoms that can be caused by these conditions doesn’t
mean that you have one of them.

This is because these symptoms can also be caused by something fairly harmless, such
as haemorrhoids. Haemorrhoids (you might hear them called piles) are swollen veins
just inside the anus.

Not everyone with the symptoms listed above needs a colonoscopy. Your doctor will
probably only suggest this test if:



you're over 40 and you've had bleeding and other symptoms above for at least six weeks


you're over 60 and you've had one or more of these symptoms for at least six weeks.
This is because older people are at greater risk of cancer. If you have bleeding,
your doctor will ask if you have any itching around your anus. Itching or soreness
around your anus are more likely to be caused by haemorrhoids than by cancer



you or your doctor can feel a lump in your abdomen, or your doctor can feel a lump
in your rectum when he or she examines you internally



you've had polyps before, or you have a family history of bowel cancer


a blood test shows that you have anaemia (not enough iron in your blood). It can be
a sign that you are slowly losing blood from your bowel, but not enough to see in
your stools



you've had another test, such as a barium enema, that shows that you have a problem
in your bowel.



In many countries, once you reach a certain age (for example, in the UK it’s 60) you
will be invited to have bowel cancer screening. You can do this test at home with
a kit that you will be sent. You then send the kit to a lab to be tested.

But bowel cancer can sometimes happen to people younger than 60. Most people who have
symptoms don’t actually have cancer. But this test can check.

What will happen?
Before the colonoscopy
A colonoscopy is done in hospital, but you can usually go home the same day. It's
not an operation and you won't have a scar or stitches afterwards. But you do need
to prepare for it.

The main thing you need to do is to clear out your bowel using a laxative, usually
at home the day before the procedure. Your nurse will give you instructions about
how to do this. These instructions will cover:



how to take the laxative


what you can and cannot eat and drink in the day or two before the test, and


how long before the test you need to stop eating and drinking.


During the colonoscopy
You’ll need to undress and put on a hospital gown. You might be offered a sedative
medication to help you relax. But you’ll be awake during the procedure. You then lie
on your side with your knees pulled up towards your chest.

During the procedure, the doctor:


will insert a flexible tube (the colonoscope) into your bowel by feeding it up through
your anus. The colonoscope has a light and a camera on the end. While feeding the
colonoscope through your bowel, the doctor watches the screen and checks for anything
unusual



can use the colonoscope to remove any polyps found during the test


can take small samples of tissue for a biopsy. It's done by passing an instrument
down a hollow tube built into the side of the colonoscope. The instrument has tiny
clippers on the end for cutting away a small piece of tissue. This shouldn’t hurt.
But let someone know if it does.



A colonoscopy can be uncomfortable and embarrassing, but it shouldn't hurt. If you
do feel pain, it's important to tell the doctor or nurse.

Some people find that they can't control their bowels during the test. This is normal.
It's just your bowel reacting to the tube inside it.

What are the risks?
Colonoscopy is a common procedure, and complications are rare. For most people, the
worst things about it will be the diarrhoea caused by the laxative and the embarrassment
of the test itself.

But, as with any medical procedure, complications do sometimes happen. These include:


the doctor being unable to see all of your bowel. Your bowel is long with lots of
twists and turns, so sometimes it's difficult to feed the colonoscope all the way
up. This can happen if the person is uncomfortable, there are loops in the bowel,
or the bowel isn't clear. If it happens, you can have a different test or another
colonoscopy later



breathing or heart problems. Sedatives and painkillers can affect your breathing and
your heart. But serious problems are rare because your breathing is monitored during
the colonoscopy



damage to the bowel: The colonoscope can poke a hole in the wall of your bowel. Doctors
call this a perforation. It's a serious problem that causes inflammation inside your
abdomen. If this happens, you'll probably need an operation to sew up the hole. But
it's not common



bleeding. You might bleed from your bottom after a colonoscopy. This is more likely
if you've had a sample of tissue or polyps removed. Some people need to go back into
hospital to stop the bleeding



an allergic reaction to the sedative. This can affect your breathing and your heart.
It's important to tell your doctor before the test if you have any allergies.



What can I expect afterwards?
The sedative wears off about an hour after the colonoscopy. You shouldn't be in any
pain, but you might feel bloated and uncomfortable for a short time. This is because
having a colonoscopy can cause there to be extra air in your bowel.

As soon as you feel awake and comfortable, you can go home. You should make sure there's
someone with you for the next 24 hours. You won't be able to drive if you've had a
sedative, so you'll need someone to help you get home.

The doctor might tell you what he or she was able to see with the colonoscope before
you go home. But if he or she took samples of tissue, you'll have to wait a few days
for the results. If you've had a biopsy or had a polyp removed, you might have blood
in your stools for a few days. If you had a polyp, you'll need at least one more colonoscopy,
between one and five years later, to check for more polyps. You might need to have
a colonoscopy every few years.

Your test results
A colonoscopy is a useful test for finding problems, including bowel cancer. But most
people who have this test don’t have cancer.

It’s likely that the results of your colonoscopy will show one of the following:


a normal bowel. This is very common. Some people have bleeding from their anus or
irregular bowel habits even if their bowel looks normal



polyps. This is very common. Polyps aren't cancer. But some polyps can turn into cancer,
so your doctor will remove them if he or she finds them during the test



inflammation. Sore-looking patches or ulcers inside your bowel can be a sign of colitis.
Colitis means the lining of your colon is inflamed (red and swollen) in places. It's
also called inflammatory bowel disease



weaknesses in the wall of your gut. Weak areas can balloon outwards to form tiny pouches.
Doctors call this diverticular disease. It's very common and often harmless



haemorrhoids (piles). These can cause itching, pain, and bleeding, but they’re not
usually a serious problem.



You can discuss the results of your colonoscopy with your doctor, and talk about any
treatments that might help you."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1566074018513/Colic%20in%20babies,Colic in babies,"Colic in babies Last published: Dec 06, 2021
When your baby has colic he or she cries a lot of the time. This can leave you feeling
anxious and exhausted. But there are things you can try that might comfort your baby.

What is colic?
Babies who have colic are not sick but they cry a lot more than babies usually do.
Colic usually starts when a baby is a few weeks old and stops at 4 or 5 months. No
one knows what causes it, but it is less common in babies who are breastfed.

For some babies colic may be a sign of a food allergy, such as being sensitive to
cows' milk. Other things that may trigger colic include:



if the baby is being breastfed some types of food or drink eaten by the mother might
set it off. Examples include chocolate, eggs, citrus fruits, caffeine (found in coffee,
tea, cola, and energy drinks), and some seafood.



exposure to cigarette smoke, both during pregnancy and after the baby is born. Colic
is twice as common in babies of mothers who smoke.



not being burped (winded) enough after feeding. This can lead to wind and painful
cramps.



If you are worried about your baby you should see your doctor. He or she will check
whether there is anything wrong that is causing your baby to cry. Always see your
doctor if:



your baby has a fever


your baby is vomiting more forcefully than usual


your baby has very runny or watery stool, or


your baby's pattern of crying changes suddenly.


Your doctor may diagnose colic if your baby cries a lot but is otherwise generally
well and gaining weight. Colic doesn't mean you are doing anything wrong as a parent.
And colic won't harm your baby.

What are the symptoms?
Here are some signs that your baby might have colic.


Your baby often starts crying suddenly. The cry is high pitched and nothing you do
seems to help.



The crying begins at the same time each day, often in the afternoon or evening.


Your baby might draw his or her legs up when crying.


Your baby might clench his or her hands.


Your baby's face might flush.


The crying can last for minutes or hours. A baby with colic cries for 3 hours a day
or more.



The crying often winds down when your baby is exhausted or when they have passed wind
or poo.



Crying is not always a sign of colic. Other reasons that babies cry include having
a wet nappy, being hungry, being too hot or cold, or being in pain.

What treatments work?
No single treatment for colic has been shown to work for all babies. You may want
to try different things to see what works for you.

Things you can do yourself
Here are some things you can try to comfort your baby and help stop the crying:


Hold your baby in an upright position to help any gas to pass.


If you are breastfeeding, allow your baby to finish one breast before you offer the
second. Try to avoid eating or drinking things that might upset your baby.



If you are bottle feeding, make sure that the hole in the nipple is the right size
for the way your baby feeds. Babies who suck hard and feed quickly need bigger holes,
otherwise they swallow too much air. You can buy bottle nipples with bigger holes
if your baby needs them.



Hold, cuddle, and carry your baby as much as you like. Even if he or she doesn't seem
to cry any less, it can help to comfort and reassure you both.



Treatments you can buy at a pharmacy or health food shop
Some parents use gripe water or simeticone drops. But we don't know whether they work.
There is no evidence to show they are helpful.

Switching formulas
If your baby is bottle fed, talk to your doctor or health visitor about whether it
is worth trying a different type of formula. Formula without certain sugars or proteins
from cows' milk may help if your baby is sensitive to cows' milk.

But if your baby is growing well on the brand of formula you use it may not be a good
idea to switch. If you want to try switching, ask your health visitor which types
of formula are suitable.

What will happen to my baby?
Your baby will probably grow out of colic by the time he or she is 4 or 5 months old.
In the meantime try not to worry as long as your baby is eating well and gaining weight
normally.

It’s important to look after yourself. If you can, take a break by letting friends
or family help look after your baby."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1535307866534/Cold%20sores,Cold sores,"Cold sores Last published: Aug 03, 2021
Cold sores are annoying and can be painful. They usually heal in a week to 10 days,
although they can come back from time to time. If you are bothered by them there are
treatments that can help.

What are cold sores?
Cold sores are blisters that appear on the lips and around the mouth. They are caused
by a virus called herpes simplex. Cold sores are sometimes called herpes labialis
or fever blisters.

There are two types of herpes simplex virus: 1 and 2. Type 1 mostly causes cold sores.
Both types can cause sores on the genitals. This information is for people who get
sores on their mouth.

You can catch herpes simplex from other people through their saliva. Most people are
first infected as children.

Some children get quite ill when they are first infected. They might get ulcers inside
their mouth and find swallowing painful.

They might also have fever, swollen glands, bad breath, a poor appetite, or little
energy.

If your child has these symptoms, take them to the doctor. Treatment can help.
Once you are infected, the herpes simplex virus stays in the nerves in your face.
It can cause further cold sores at any time.

Certain things seem to trigger new attacks, including:


throat infections


your periods (if you are a woman)


sunlight, and


certain medicines, including steroids.


It's possible to get a more serious illness from the herpes simplex virus, but this
is rare. However, people who have a weak immune system have more chance of more serious
problems.

If you have a weak immune system (for example, from HIV or from cancer treatment)
and you get symptoms of herpes simplex infection, see your doctor.

What are the symptoms?
Cold sores start as red patches and become small blisters. When the blisters burst
the skin becomes an open sore. Some people also get a fever. Your skin returns to
normal in a week to 10 days.

Some people get a tingling or burning feeling on their lips about two days before
their blisters appear.

Cold sores are usually at their most severe the first time you get them. If you get
another outbreak of symptoms it will probably be milder than the first and your symptoms
will probably go away more quickly (although the sore might take about the same amount
of time to heal).

You are most likely to pass the virus to other people through your saliva when you
have cold sores, or feel them coming on.

To reduce this risk, avoid kissing during these times and don't share food, drinks,
and cutlery. Also, avoid giving oral sex when you have a cold sore.

What treatments work?
Cold sores usually clear up without any treatment in seven to 10 days. But there are
some things you can try to help prevent and treat attacks.

Things you can do yourself
If sunlight triggers your cold sores, you might try using sunscreen on your lips and mouth to protect your skin from the sun. This might reduce the chance of new cold sores.

If your cold sore is painful you can take pain medicines, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen. You might also try rubbing a pain-relieving gel
called lidocaine on the affected area.

Some people use antiviral creams when they feel a cold sore coming on. These are available over the counter at pharmacies.
But they don't work as well as prescription antiviral tablets (see below).

Prescription medicines
Doctors sometimes prescribe antiviral medicines to treat bad cold sores, often during first outbreaks.

Your doctor might also suggest them if you get cold sores regularly or if you have
a weak immune system. They seem to work better than antiviral creams.

But most people who don't have regular outbreaks don't need prescription antiviral
medicines because cold sores usually go away on their own without causing serious
problems.

Your doctor can prescribe antiviral medicines as tablets, or as a liquid for babies
or young children.  They can help speed up healing and reduce pain.

Taking antiviral drugs just before the cold sore appears (if you get early symptoms
like tingling) or as soon as they appear can speed up recovery.

If you have frequent or severe cold sores your doctor might suggest that you take
antiviral drugs every day. This can cut down on how often you get cold sores.

Antiviral drugs don't usually cause side effects in most people. Some people get headaches
or feel sick, but these effects are usually mild and don't usually stop people taking
their treatment.

What will happen to me?
Once you get a first cold sore you are likely to get them again. But for most people
these usually clear up without treatment in about 7 to 10 days. If you are bothered
by a cold sore, have a weak immune system, or get them frequently, see your doctor."

If you have coeliac disease, eating foods that contain a type of protein called gluten
can damage your gut. Following a gluten-free diet allows the gut to heal. You will
need to cut out gluten from your diet for the rest of your life. This can be difficult,
so it’s important to get support and expert advice.

What is coeliac disease?
If you have coeliac disease your body reacts to gluten, a protein found in wheat,
barley, and rye.

Coeliac disease is not a food allergy or intolerance. It’s an autoimmune disease.
This means that your immune system (which normally fights infection in your body)
mistakenly sees substances in gluten as a threat and attacks them.

This causes damage to the surface of the gut, so you can't absorb food properly. This
causes a range of symptoms and health problems.

The gut is the main part of the body affected, but almost any part of the body can
be damaged by coeliac disease.

Coeliac disease can start at any time but most people are diagnosed between the ages
of 40 and 50. It can sometimes start in childhood, when foods containing gluten are
first added to a child’s diet.

Certain things increase your chances of getting coeliac disease, including having:


coeliac disease in your family


type 1 diabetes


thyroid disease.


Coeliac disease affects about 1 in 100 people. Many people with the condition don’t
know that they have it.

What are the symptoms?
Coeliac disease can cause many different symptoms. Some are caused by damage in the
gut. Others happen because you are not absorbing enough nutrients. The most common
symptoms in adults are:



diarrhoea


bloating


having a lot of wind (flatulence)


weight loss


belly pain and discomfort


feeling very tired all the time. This is because you are not getting enough nutrients.




Not getting enough nutrients can cause complications. You might get anaemia, which
means you don't have enough iron in your blood. This happens because you don't absorb
enough iron from your food.

If you don't get enough calcium you have a greater chance of getting brittle bones
(osteoporosis) and fractures.

Young children might get symptoms of coeliac disease when they first eat gluten. Children
might get some or all of these symptoms:



not gaining weight and not growing normally


diarrhoea (more common) or constipation (less common)


poorly formed muscles


pale skin


lack of energy


swelling in the belly.


About 1 in 10 people with coeliac disease get a very itchy rash, usually over their
elbows, knees, buttocks, shoulders, and scalp. Doctors call this rash dermatitis herpetiformis.

If your doctor thinks you might have coeliac disease he or she will do a blood test
to check for chemicals (called antibodies) that show whether your body reacts against
gluten.

If the results are positive, or if your symptoms make it very likely you have coeliac
disease, you will need to have a biopsy. To take a biopsy, doctors pass a thin, bendy
tube into your mouth and down to your small intestine, where they will take a small
sample of tissue from your gut wall.

You should not stop eating food that contains gluten until you have had your tests,
otherwise they might give a false result.

What treatments work?
If you have coeliac disease you will need to follow a strict gluten-free diet for
the rest of your life. You will be referred to a dietitian for advice and guidance
on how to do this. You need to swap foods containing gluten for other foods, to make
sure that you get all the nutrients you need.

Following a gluten-free diet means not eating foods that contain:


wheat (and similar grains including spelt, couscous, semolina, and bulgar wheat)


barley


rye.


Many common foods contain gluten, including bread, cakes, biscuits, pizzas, cereals,
and beers and ales. Many ready meals, soups, sauces, and sausages also contain wheat
flour.

Gluten is also ‘hidden’ where you might not expect it: for example, in some sweets,
salad dressings, and cosmetics. You will need to get used to reading the labels of
foods to see what contains gluten.

You might have to stop eating oats, at least to start with. After your symptoms have
cleared up you will probably be able to eat oats.

There are still plenty of foods you can eat. Your dietitian will give you a list of
foods that are naturally free of gluten. These include rice, potatoes, polenta, quinoa,
millet, unprocessed meat, eggs, fish, milk cheese, fruit, vegetables, beans, and most
yoghurts.

You should also be able to drink wine and most spirits.
Your doctor or dietitian might also recommend you take a daily multi-vitamin and a
supplement of calcium and vitamin D.

That’s partly because you might find it hard to get all the nutrients you need on
a gluten-free diet, and partly because you might find it harder to absorb nutrients
if your gut has been damaged.

You can buy foods that are gluten-free from most supermarkets and health food shops.
It can be hard to stick to a gluten-free diet. You might find that it helps to talk
to other people with coeliac disease to get support and swap tips about a gluten-free
diet.

What will happen to me?
Following a gluten-free diet will help to clear up your symptoms and heal your gut.
But the speed at which this happens varies a lot.

Some people start to feel better within days or weeks. Others find it takes months
to feel completely better. It depends in part on how long you have had coeliac disease
and how much your gut has been damaged. Healing is often quicker in children.

It’s important to stick to a gluten-free diet. People with coeliac disease who continue
to eat gluten are more likely to get health problems, including osteoporosis (brittle
bones), a type of intestine cancer, and other autoimmune diseases.

If you find it very hard to stick to a gluten-free diet it’s important to get support.
See your doctor or dietitian, or think about joining a group in your area for people
with coeliac disease.

Where to get more help?
There are various charities and support groups for people with coeliac disease. For
example, Coeliac UK (www.coeliac.org.uk) is a charity for people with coeliac disease
and their families in the UK."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/3000146/Cocaine%20use%20disorder,Cocaine use disorder,"Cocaine use disorder Last published: May 16, 2022
Cocaine use is common in many countries. Apart from the dangers to physical and mental
health caused by long-term use, it can lead to non-medical problems, such as problems
with money, family, work, and the law.

If you are concerned about your cocaine use, or about use by someone you know, you
can use our information to talk to your doctor about getting help.

What is cocaine abuse?
Cocaine is mainly thought of as a recreational or 'street' drug. But it does have
some medical uses. For example, it can be used as a local anaesthetic, for numbing
pain in small areas of the body. But when it is used for non-medical reasons, to get
'high', this is called cocaine abuse.

The drug is usually inhaled through the nose ('snorted'), although it can also be
injected, or smoked as freebase or 'crack' cocaine.

Cocaine addiction is hard to overcome. But stopping using cocaine can be hard even
when you are not addicted, especially if there is social pressure to take it. For
example, you might socialise with a group of friends who expect you to use it with
them.

Cocaine gives a similar experience to some other illegal street drugs. When used occasionally,
it gives the user a short-term high, followed by a 'come-down', when you might feel
exhausted, confused, and sometimes paranoid and depressed.

Taking too much cocaine in a short time can lead to an overdose, which can cause death.
Many people get treatment for cocaine abuse after seeking emergency medical help for
an overdose, or for chest pain caused by cocaine use.

Longer-term use can cause different problems depending on how you take the drug.


Snorting cocaine can cause serious heart problems and damage to the delicate tissues
in the nose.



Smoking cocaine can cause serious eye problems and severe lung damage ('crack lung').


Injecting cocaine can lead to infections such as HIV and hepatitis.


All forms of cocaine use can cause psychosis (losing touch with reality), depression
and other mental-health problems, and suicidal thoughts.



The dangers from using cocaine don’t just come from the drug itself. Producers of
illegal drugs 'cut' their products with other, cheaper substances, either to bulk
them out so they make more money, or to make their effects more intense.

Cocaine is most commonly cut with a substance called levamisole, a drug for de-worming
livestock. In humans, levamisole can cause serious health problems, including dangerously
low levels of white blood cells and painful sores on the skin.

Cocaine use can also lead to serious non-medical problems, including:


money problems


family problems


violent behaviour


paranoia


problems at school or work, and loss of employment


marriage and relationship problems


problems with the law.


What are the symptoms?
The symptoms of cocaine abuse vary depending on several things, including:


how long someone has been using the drug


how they take it (for example, snorting or injecting)


what form they take it in (for example, have they taken cocaine or crack), and


whether they have had an overdose.


Their symptoms will also be different depending on whether they are still 'high' or
coming down from down the drug.

Symptoms of short-term cocaine use (not crack cocaine)
If someone you know has recently used cocaine and is still high, the main symptom
will be euphoria (feeling happy and excited). Along with this, they might:



seem wide awake and more active than usual, even late at night


seem jittery and anxious


have trouble concentrating


seem paranoid. This can get worse once the drug wears off and they start to come down.


In more extreme cases, someone might:


have chest pain


lose consciousness (black out)


feel physically weak


be confused and have trouble speaking


seem physically clumsy and have trouble doing simple things like walking or holding
an object



have problems with their vision.


Longer-term use
Signs of longer-term cocaine use include:


salmon-coloured marks on the skin, or signs of skin infection, if they have been injecting
cocaine



damage to the nose (called nasal septum perforation) caused by long-term snorting.
This often causes symptoms such as breathing problems and frequent nosebleeds



an unusually fast heartbeat


extreme agitation and moodiness


depression, and


physical problems similar to those with short-term use, such as weakness, clumsiness,
and having trouble speaking.



Symptoms of crack cocaine use
Many of the symptoms of crack use are the same as those for non-crack cocaine.
But people who have been using crack for a long time often have burn injuries to their
lips and thumbs, from smoking the drug through small home-made devices, sometimes
called 'crack pipes'.

These injuries are sometimes called 'crack lip' and 'crack thumb'.
Symptoms of cocaine overdose
If someone takes a large amount of cocaine in a short period of time this can cause
an overdose. This is extremely dangerous and can cause death.

Symptoms of a cocaine overdose include:


an unusually fast heartbeat


a very high body temperature


extreme sweating


confusion and other signs of mental disturbance.


What treatments work?
The treatments for cocaine abuse depend on the person’s immediate needs.
For example, someone who goes to hospital suffering from the effects of cocaine use,
or from an overdose, will need different treatment from someone who asks their doctor
for help with addiction problems.

Emergency treatment
There is no specific treatment for the effects of cocaine. Treatments are aimed at
relieving someone’s symptoms until they recover. People who go to hospital with problems
caused by cocaine use, or with a cocaine overdose, might be given:



treatment for heart problems


a sedative medication for psychological symptoms, such as extreme confusion and agitation




drugs to lower dangerously high blood pressure caused by cocaine


oxygen, if they are unconscious


fluids through an intravenous (IV) drip if they are dehydrated


medicines to control seizures, if they are having them


ice water baths to reduce a dangerously high temperature caused by a cocaine overdose.


Body packing
Someone can be in particular danger from a severe overdose if they have been 'body
packing' or 'body stuffing'.

This is when someone swallows a lot of packets of cocaine, intending to pass them
out of their body later when they go to the toilet. They do this to hide the drugs,
usually when smuggling or transporting them without anyone knowing.

The danger is that one or more of the packets will break open while still inside the
person. This can cause a severe overdose, and the person might need emergency surgery
to remove the packets of cocaine.

If you think someone you know is having an overdose because of body packing, call
an ambulance straight away.

Treatment for cocaine addiction
The ideal treatment for someone addicted to cocaine involves a drug counsellor or
a drug treatment service. But this treatment is not always available, and there can
be waiting times. You can talk to your doctor about what treatments are available
in your area.

People who have mental-health problems caused by cocaine use, or who already had mental-health
problems, might be able to get help from mental health services.

What will happen?
The best thing for someone who wants to stop using cocaine is to get into a drug treatment
programme. Many people are helped by these programmes, including those with serious
addiction issues.

If you are in one of these programmes you will need to have regular urine tests, to
make sure that you are no longer using cocaine.

The mental-health problems that cocaine abuse causes are usually temporary, and stop
soon after you stop using the drug.

But many of the serious physical problems, such as damage to the heart, lungs, and
nose, can last a long time, and you might need long-term treatment for them. People
who inject cocaine can also get serious infections such as HIV and hepatitis.

There are various online resources for people with drug problems. For example, the
Frank website (talktofrank.com) provides help and information on many issues around drug
abuse. You can also text, email, or call the Frank helpline."

Cluster headaches are attacks of very severe pain, usually on one side of the head
only. They can happen up to several times a day over a period of several weeks.

Standard painkillers, such as paracetamol, aren’t useful for cluster headaches, because
they take too long to start working. But specialist treatments can help prevent and
treat them.

You can use our information to talk with your doctor about the best treatments for
you.

What treatments are available?
As the name suggests, cluster headaches are brief but very severe headaches that happen
in clusters, sometimes more than once a day, over several weeks.

An episode of cluster headache can last between 15 minutes and three hours. The frequency
of the attacks can vary from one every two days to eight times a day.

The period of time when the headaches happen is called the cluster period. It can vary from one week to one year. But in most people it lasts two or three
months.

At the end of a cluster period, most people go for at least three months, and sometimes
for years, without headaches. This period without headaches is called remission.

Treatment for cluster headaches aims to:



relieve the pain of the attacks as quickly as possible, and


prevent other attacks for the length of the cluster period, or at least make these
attacks less severe.



In people who have chronic cluster headaches (when there are no periods of remission),
the aim is to prevent attacks, or to make them less severe, over longer periods.

Fast pain relief for attacks
Triptans
The main treatment to quickly relieve the pain of cluster headaches is medicines called
triptans.

You take these medicines either as a pain-killing injection or, if you don’t want to give yourself injections, as a nasal spray.

Injections and sprays are used because they work much more quickly than tablets. Most
people find that their pain stops about 15 minutes after a triptan injection. Injections
seem to work better than nasal sprays for many people.

If you use the injections, you keep them with you for when you need them. You can
safely give yourself up to two injections each day.

Oxygen
Another treatment that can work well to relieve the pain of cluster headaches is oxygen.
Breathing 100 percent oxygen through a mask for about 15 minutes relieves the pain of an attack in most people.

Your doctor will explain to you how to get the oxygen and the equipment you will need,
and how to keep it safely at home.

Preventing attacks
Medicines
Several different medicines can be used to help prevent cluster headaches. One medicine
that seems to work well for many people is called verapamil.

This medicine is usually used to treat heart conditions. So your doctor will want
to check your heart before prescribing it, to make sure that it’s safe for you to
take.

The idea is that you start to take it when you begin to have cluster headaches. After
you have been free of headaches for two weeks, you gradually reduce the dose down
to nothing.

It’s important not to take verapamil for longer than you need to, as it can cause
side effects in some people.

If verapamil doesn’t help you enough, or if you have problems with side effects, there
are other medicines that you can try. One of these is called valproate. Pregnant women should not take valproate, as it causes severe birth defects.

Transitional treatment
It can take several weeks for the medicines that prevent attacks to work properly.
So your doctor might suggest what’s called transitional therapy.

This means taking extra medicines to help control your symptoms until the prevention
medicines are working fully.

For example, one commonly used transitional treatment is steroids (the full name is
corticosteroids). These medicines help reduce inflammation (swelling) around the nerves, which in
turn helps to reduce pain.

If your doctor suggests this treatment, it will only be for a short time, as corticosteroids
can cause serious side effects if you take them for too long.

Another transitional treatment is a nerve block. This is an injection of a drug that stops some nerves from sending pain signals
to your brain.

Nerve blocks can also be used every few months to help treat chronic cluster headaches.
Surgery
There are two types of surgery that are sometimes used when other treatments haven’t
worked.

They are called occipital nerve stimulation and deep brain stimulation. They both involve implanting small devices under the skin. These devices send mild
electrical pulses to the nerves that can help reduce the pain of cluster headaches.

As with any type of surgery, these operations carry risks, such as infections. If
you discuss these treatments with your doctor, he or she should carefully explain
these risks.

What to expect in the future?
Cluster headaches can be difficult to live with. They are extremely unpleasant, and
treating them can be complicated and troublesome to manage.

Some people suffer from depression as a result of having cluster headaches. If you find yourself becoming depressed,
don’t keep these feelings to yourself. Talk to your doctor, and to family and friends.

But there is some good news:


cluster headaches don’t lead to any long-term physical problems. For example, unlike
some types of headache, they’re not a possible sign of something more serious, and



in many people the symptoms become less severe as they get older.


When you first start treatment you should be seen by a neurologist. Neurologists specialise in conditions like cluster headaches that affect the nervous
system. Your usual doctor might also want to check how you’re doing from time to time.

Your doctor might also be able to put you in touch with a support group.

For example, in the UK, the Organisation for the Understanding of Cluster Headache
(ouchuk.org) offers support and guidance for people living with cluster headaches
and their families."

But some people get chronic cluster headaches (chronic means long-lasting). This means that they don’t get spells
of remission.

What causes cluster headaches?
There seems to be a genetic link to cluster headaches. This means that people are
more likely to get cluster headaches if they have family members who get them.

Several other things have been suggested as causes of cluster headaches, including:


heavy smoking


heavy drinking


sleep apnoea, and


a history of head injuries.


But there isn’t much evidence to support these ideas. The truth is that we don’t really
know why most people get cluster headaches.

Some people say that certain triggers can bring on cluster headaches. These include things like drinking alcohol, and strong
chemical-type smells, such as perfume, paint, and petrol.

Who gets cluster headaches?
Cluster headaches are not common. What we know about who gets them is that:


they seem to affect about one in every 500 people


they usually begin between the ages of 30 and 40 years although, very rarely, they
can happen in young children



men are between two and four times more likely than women to get cluster headaches.


What are the symptoms?
The kind of headaches that most of us get from time to time cause a dull, throbbing
pain.

They are not pleasant, but they are not always severe. And they usually go away if
you take some painkillers, lie down for a while, or drink some water.

A cluster headache is a different type of headache. The pain of cluster headaches:



usually comes on very quickly


is sharp and extremely severe


tends to be on one side of the head, although in some people it can move from one
side to the other



is often around an eye, temple, or sometimes in the face


tends to be on the same side each time.


As well as severe pain, cluster headaches usually cause other symptoms, which can
include:



extreme agitation and restlessness. Most people can’t stay still during an attack


red, watery eyes


a blocked or runny nose


sweating on the face


nausea and vomiting


needing to avoid bright light (this is called photophobia) and noise (this is called phonophobia)



a swollen, droopy eyelid on the side of the face affected by the headache, and


the pupil of the affected eye becoming smaller.


If you see your doctor with symptoms of cluster headaches, he or she might suggest
that you have a scan. The scan can’t tell if your pain is caused by cluster headaches, but it might be
able to rule out other causes.

Cirrhosis is scarring of the liver caused by long-term liver damage. This scarring
affects how well your liver works. There is no cure for cirrhosis but treatments can
help to stop more damage. Some people’s liver damage is so severe that they need a
liver transplant.

What treatments work?
Cirrhosis can’t be cured. But if you have cirrhosis there are three main ways to try
to keep your liver as healthy as possible:



Treating the condition that has caused the liver damage (liver damage is usually caused
by another condition: for example, hepatitis).



Preventing further damage to your liver from other sources, such as alcohol or some
medications.



Preventing complications of cirrhosis that can cause serious health problems.


Treating the condition that has caused your liver damage
Many conditions can cause liver damage that can lead to cirrhosis. They include:


hepatitis B and C


alcoholic liver disease


non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)


Less common inherited conditions include:


haemochromatosis, where your body absorbs too much iron from the food you eat


Wilson’s disease, a condition where too much copper builds up in the body, causing
liver damage



cystic fibrosis, which may damage the lungs and other organs including the liver.


These conditions are treated in different ways. The important thing is that getting
the right treatment can reduce any further damage to your liver.

Preventing further damage to your liver
It’s important to try to avoid things that can damage your liver. Things that can
help include:



not drinking alcohol. This is vital. People with cirrhosis should not drink alcohol
at all. If you have a problem with stopping drinking, talk to your doctor



avoiding medications that can cause liver damage. These include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen. You should also try to avoid taking paracetamol
too often, and never take more than the dose recommended by your doctor. This will
be less than the usual maximum daily dose



keeping to a healthy weight


eating a healthy, balanced diet. Malnutrition is common in people with cirrhosis


taking regular exercise.


You should also make sure you are vaccinated against hepatitis A and B if you are
at high risk of infection. You are at high risk of hepatitis if you:



inject recreational drugs


change sexual partners often


are a man who has sex with men


have close family members or a partner with hepatitis


travel to countries where hepatitis is common


are a healthcare worker.


Preventing complications
Cirrhosis can cause serious complications, so you will need to have some tests every
six to 12 months. These tests can show if your cirrhosis has caused any complications.
Your doctor will then be able to advise you about any extra treatment you might need.


These tests may include blood tests, scans, and an endoscopy. This is when a small
camera is passed down your throat on a thin tube.

This test can spot blood vessels in your oesophagus (food pipe), which have become
too wide and can sometimes bleed. These widened blood vessels are called varices. This problem is usually treated with medicines called beta blockers or with surgery.


Other complications of cirrhosis include:
Fluid collecting in your abdomen. This is called ascites. This can be treated by reducing your salt intake, and with medicines called diuretics,
which help stop your body from retaining too much fluid. Sometimes it needs to be
treated by draining fluid from the abdomen. This is called paracentesis.

Infections. If you have ascites the fluid can become infected. This is called bacterial peritonitis. If this happens you will need treatment with antibiotics. You will also need to
take antibiotics for the rest of your life to stop the problem returning.

Liver cancer. People with cirrhosis have an increased chance of getting liver cancer. Regular
scans can help to detect the problem early, when it is easier to treat.

Toxins collecting in the brain. This is called encephalopathy. It happens when the liver is not clearing toxins from your blood properly. It can
cause changes in behaviour as well as physical symptoms such as stomach problems.
It can be treated with medicines, including antibiotics.

Liver transplant
If you have serious complications, or if your liver is failing, your doctor might
refer you to a specialist who might recommend that you have a liver transplant.

This is a major operation. The surgeon removes your damaged liver and replaces it
with a healthy one from a donor.

But you may have to wait a long time for a replacement liver, because there are usually
more people who need livers than there are livers available. This sometimes means
that people die while waiting for a suitable liver."

Cirrhosis is scarring of the liver caused by long-term liver damage. This scarring
affects how well your liver works. There is no cure for cirrhosis but treatments can
help to stop more damage.

What is cirrhosis?
The liver does many jobs, including helping with digestion and removing harmful toxins
from your body.

Long-term liver damage can lead to scarring of the liver, called cirrhosis. The damage
can’t be reversed but treatments can often help stop it getting any worse. Some people’s
livers are so badly damaged that they need a liver transplant.

Any long-term condition or disease that affects the liver can cause cirrhosis. Some
of the most common causes are:



long-term viral hepatitis (either hepatitis B or hepatitis C)


alcoholic liver disease, caused by drinking too much alcohol over many years


non-alcoholic fatty-liver disease, or NAFLD. Obesity is a common cause of NAFLD


non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH. This is a more serious type of NAFLD, where
the liver becomes inflamed (swollen)



some medicines and recreational drugs.


Less common inherited causes include:


Wilson’s disease, a condition where too much copper builds up in the body, causing
liver damage



cystic fibrosis, which can damage the lungs and other organs including the liver.


What are the symptoms?
Most people don’t have any symptoms in the early stages of liver disease. Symptoms
tend to develop later as the liver’s various functions are affected. Symptoms of cirrhosis
include:



swelling around the abdomen (tummy)


yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes (jaundice)


very itchy skin


vomit that has a consistency (texture) like coffee grounds


black stools


muscle wasting


unexpected weight loss


bleeding and bruising more easily than you should. For example, you might have regular
nosebleeds



memory problems and confusion


tiny red lines (small blood vessels) visible on the skin


whitening of the fingernails.


If your doctor thinks you may have cirrhosis he or she will ask you about the symptoms
listed above, and about:



how much alcohol you drink


any illnesses you have had in the past


any medicines you are taking now and have taken for long periods in the past


any vitamins or other supplements or herbal remedies you have taken for a long time.


Your doctor will also check you for physical signs that might suggest liver problems.
For example, he or she will look for signs such as bruising, tiny red lines on your
skin, or whitening of the fingernails.

You will also need a blood test. This can identify hepatitis as well as other things
that can suggest liver problems.

What will happen?
If you are diagnosed with cirrhosis you might need more blood tests to check what
has caused the problem and how severe it is. You will also need an ultrasound scan to check if your liver is swollen.

Another test you will need is called an endoscopy. This is where a small camera is guided down your throat to check for damage in the
blood vessels in the oesophagus (the tube that leads from your mouth to your stomach).
Damage to the oesophagus is a guide to how severe your cirrhosis is.

Your doctor will want to check how you are doing regularly. So you will need to have
blood tests and an ultrasound scan every 6 to 12 months. You might also need to have
another endoscopy every year or two.

Your doctor will advise you about things that can help reduce liver damage, such as
avoiding alcohol, keeping your weight at a healthy level, getting enough exercise,
and good nutrition.

Your doctor will also advise you about medicines to avoid, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen.

You should also try to avoid taking paracetamol too often, and never take more than
the dose recommended by your doctor. This will be lower than the normal recommended
maximum daily dose.

Cirrhosis can be fatal. But this depends on how severe the problem is. People with
the most severe disease can get worse very quickly. But most people with cirrhosis
that is not too severe live for many years. For more information on treatments for
cirrhosis see our leaflet Cirrhosis: what treatments work?"
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/3000048/Chronic%20pancreatitis,Chronic pancreatitis,"Chronic pancreatitis Last published: Sep 02, 2021
Chronic pancreatitis happens when the pancreas becomes damaged over time by inflammation
(swelling), which causes pain and other symptoms. It is often linked to years of drinking
too much alcohol. There is no cure, but treatment can help slow down the damage.

You can use our information to talk with your doctor about what treatments are right
for you.

What is chronic pancreatitis?
Your pancreas lies just behind your stomach. It's a gland that helps you break down
food to use as energy.

Inflammation can damage the pancreas so that it doesn’t work as well as it should.
This inflammation is called pancreatitis. Pancreatitis can either be:



acute - this means it comes on suddenly, or


chronic - this means it happens gradually over years and doesn’t go away.


This leaflet deals with chronic pancreatitis.
People with this condition tend not to live as long as they might otherwise have.
It is usually linked to years of heavy drinking. But other things that can make the
condition more likely include:



smoking


having a condition called coeliac disease


your genes - pancreatitis can be hereditary (inherited)


eating a high-fat, high-protein diet.


But some people get the condition for no obvious reason. This is called ‘idiopathic’
chronic pancreatitis.

Pancreatitis that’s linked to drinking alcohol happens in adults. But hereditary chronic
pancreatitis can happen in children, usually in late childhood and the early teenage
years.

Another type of pancreatitis, called juvenile idiopathic chronic pancreatitis, can
happen to young people, usually when they are aged between about 19 and 23. Idiopathic
pancreatitis can also develop in late middle age.

What are the symptoms?
The main symptom of chronic pancreatitis is a dull abdominal (tummy) pain that spreads
to the back. It seems to get better when people sit and lean forwards, and it gets
worse about half an hour after eating.

There are other symptoms, but they don’t happen to everyone. They include:


jaundice (yellowing of the skin)


having a lot of fat in your stools. They might be foul smelling and hard to flush.
This is called steatorrhoea



malnutrition. This happens partly because people are afraid to eat because it makes
the pain worse. Malnutrition can lead to other symptoms, such as tiredness and weight
loss



nausea and vomiting


shortness of breath.


If your doctor thinks you might have chronic pancreatitis, he or she might do some
tests. These might include blood tests, and scans, such as x-rays and ultrasound.


These scans can help to show up small lumps or stones in the pancreas, called calcifications.
These are build-ups of calcium that happen with chronic pancreatitis.

What treatments work?
There is no cure for chronic pancreatitis. But treatments can:


reduce pain and other symptoms


stop you from losing too much weight


help you get the right nutrition


help with diabetes and other complications


ensure that you get screened for pancreatic cancer if needed. Some people with pancreatitis
have an increased chance of pancreatic cancer



help maintain or improve your quality of life.


Treatments include changes to your lifestyle, pain relief, medicines to help you get
nutrition from your food, and, in some cases, surgery.

Lifestyle changes
If you smoke, drink alcohol, or both, your doctor will strongly advise you to stop.
Stopping doing these things will not reverse the damage to your pancreas, but it can
stop it getting worse.

It’s a good idea to stop drinking alcohol even if it was not the cause of your pancreatitis.
This is because drinking alcohol can cause pain in people with chronic pancreatitis,
whatever the cause.

Pain relief
You might be able to control your pain using simple painkillers such as paracetamol
or ibuprofen. But if these don’t help your doctor might prescribe stronger painkillers.
Always follow your doctor’s advice carefully when taking these medicines.

You might also be offered a low-dose antidepressant medicine. These drugs are usually
used to treat conditions such as depression and anxiety. But in some people they can
help with pain. You can discuss with your doctor what medicines are right for you.

Nutrition
Your doctor will probably recommend that you eat quite a high-calorie diet. This is
because your body needs more energy if you have pancreatitis. You will probably be
advised to eat small, regular meals, in a ‘little and often’ way.

To help you get nutrition from your food without too much pain, your doctor will probably
prescribe treatments called pancreatic enzymes. These are medicines that help your
pancreas process the food you eat.

Your doctor might recommend a low-fat diet, but only if you are in extreme pain. This
is because fat is important in helping us absorb vitamins. Low-fat diets are usually
only recommended for people who are being treated in hospital for severe symptoms.

Surgery
Most people with chronic pancreatitis don’t need surgery. But you might need an operation
if:



a build-up of calcium (calcification) has caused a pancreatic duct to become blocked,
or



you have a pancreatic cyst that needs to be drained. Cysts are sacs of fluid that
can form on the surface of the pancreas. They often go away by themselves. But if
they cause symptoms, such as pain, they might need to be drained.




If you have diabetes
Treatment for people with pancreatitis who also have diabetes is largely the same
as for other people. But you will need to take insulin.

Your doctor will want to keep a close eye on your treatment. This is because people
who need to take insulin and who have pancreatitis have a greater chance of hypoglycaemia
(having a ‘hypo’).

What will happen?
With treatment, the pain of pancreatitis usually decreases over time, although this
can take several years. If you have pain that doesn’t get better, tell your doctor.


People with chronic pancreatitis tend to die younger than would be expected if they
didn’t have the condition, especially those with juvenile or hereditary pancreatitis.
Your doctor will talk with you about how pancreatitis affects life expectancy.

Whatever type of the condition you have, you will probably need to take your pancreatic
enzyme medicine for life.

Having pancreatitis can sometimes lead to other conditions, such as diabetes, pancreatic
cancer, and an increased chance of fractures. Your doctor might recommend that you
have regular screening for pancreatic cancer, especially if your pancreatitis is inherited.


The pain and stress of pancreatitis can be difficult to deal with emotionally. Getting
support can help, as can talking to other people with the condition.

For example, in the UK, the Pancreatitis Supporters Network (pancreatitis.org.uk)
offers information, advice, and a chance to meet others with the condition."

If you have chronic kidney disease your kidneys are becoming less able to filter waste
material and excess fluid from your blood. It is a serious condition, but there are
good treatments that can help slow the disease.

You can use our information to talk to your doctor about which treatments are best
for you.

Chronic kidney disease means your kidneys are losing their ability to filter waste
products out of your blood.

You may also hear it called chronic renal failure, chronic kidney failure, or chronic renal insufficiency. Chronic means it’s a long-term condition, and renal means it involves your kidneys.

There is no cure for chronic kidney disease. But treatments can slow the disease,
reduce your symptoms, and reduce the chance of complications. The outlook is especially
good if you catch the kidney damage early.

Treating the cause
Treating the underlying cause of your kidney damage is essential.
For many people this will mean closely controlling their diabetes or high blood pressure,
by taking medicines and following their doctor's advice on things like diet, exercise,
weight loss, and smoking. This can help slow further damage.

Treating high blood pressure
High blood pressure can be both a cause and a result of chronic kidney disease. It
happens because of the fluid that builds up in your blood and tissues when your kidneys
aren't filtering properly.

If not treated, high blood pressure can cause further damage to your kidneys and can
also lead to heart disease.

Most people with chronic kidney disease take blood pressure drugs. Your doctor will
probably prescribe blood pressure medicines called angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs).

These medicines should reduce your blood pressure and help your kidneys work better.
If these medicines don't help enough or if you can't take them for some reason, there
are other blood pressure drugs you can try.

To protect your kidneys as much as possible, your doctor may aim to lower your blood
pressure below what would be normal if you didn't have kidney disease.

Managing your cholesterol
Having chronic kidney disease puts you at higher risk of developing heart disease.
Your doctor may prescribe medicines called statins to help lower this risk.

These drugs reduce your level of 'bad' cholesterol, so there's less of it to build
up inside your blood vessels and cause heart and circulation problems.

Treating problems caused by kidney failure
Chronic kidney disease can cause problems throughout your body. You will have regular
blood and urine tests to spot many of these problems before they become serious.

Below are some of the most common problems, and their treatments.


Fluid retention: Fluid can build up in your body if your kidneys aren't working well. This can cause
swelling in your limbs (called oedema), as well as high blood pressure.

If your kidneys are working well enough, drugs called diuretics can help flush excess
fluid from your body as urine. Your doctor may also recommend restricting how much
fluid and salt you consume each day.



Anaemia: Anaemia is when you have too few red blood cells. This can make you feel very tired
and become breathless easily.

Anaemia often happens to people with kidney disease because the kidneys aren't making
enough of a chemical called erythropoietin (EPO).

EPO helps regulate how many red blood cells your body makes. Treatment involves getting
injections with a medicine that works like EPO (called an erythropoiesis-stimulating
agent).

Iron is also important for making red blood cells. So if you are low on iron you will
need to take iron tablets or have iron injections.



Weakened bones: Vitamin D, phosphate, and calcium are all essential for strong bones. If your kidneys
are damaged your supply of these nutrients can get out of balance and cause problems.

In particular, your calcium level may get too low, triggering the release of a chemical
called parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTH causes reduced calcium in your bones. Over time
this can lead to weakened and deformed bones, and swollen joints.

To prevent these problems, many people with kidney failure take calcium and vitamin
D supplements. Some people also limit the amount of phosphate in their diet, as this
helps to increase the amount of calcium available for their bones.

You might also take drugs called phosphate binders, which lower the amount of phosphate
in your blood.



Too much acid: If the kidneys aren't removing enough acid from the body, you can get a condition
called metabolic acidosis.

Often there are no clear symptoms. But if your blood becomes too acidic, this can
cause serious problems such as abnormal heart rhythms, seizures, and coma.

If tests show your blood is becoming overly acidic you'll be treated with an antacid
called sodium bicarbonate (baking soda).



Too much potassium: If the kidneys aren't working properly, potassium can build up in the blood, causing
a condition called hyperkalaemia.

If not treated, this can lead to problems such as abnormal heart rhythms, cardiac
arrest, and problems with nerve and muscle control.

Your doctor will keep an eye on your potassium level and may recommend that you limit
the amount of potassium in your diet.

You might also take a diuretic or another type of medicine to help your body get rid
of both extra fluid and potassium.

If hyperkalaemia becomes severe it is a medical emergency that requires hospital treatment.


Too little protein: As kidney disease worsens, more and more protein leaks into your urine from your
kidneys. This means there's less protein to nourish your body and you may lose weight.

Your doctor might suggest changes in your diet to help with this.


Treating end-stage kidney disease
If your kidney damage worsens to the point where you have less than 15 percent of
your normal kidney function, you have end-stage kidney disease.

This means that your kidneys can no longer clear your body of wastes and extra fluid,
and you need either dialysis or a kidney transplant.

Doctors typically discuss these treatments with patients before they reach this stage.
That way, they'll have a treatment plan in place once their kidneys are no longer
working.

If you have chronic kidney disease your kidneys are gradually losing their ability
to filter waste material and excess fluid from your blood. It is a serious condition,
but there are good treatments that can help slow the disease.

What is chronic kidney disease?
Having chronic kidney disease means that your kidneys are losing their ability to
filter waste products out of your blood. You may also hear it called chronic renal failure, chronic kidney failure, or chronic renal insufficiency. Chronic means it’s a long-term condition, and renal means it involves your kidneys.

Your kidneys are two organs located just below your ribs near the middle of your back,
with one on either side of your spine. They filter your blood, getting rid of wastes
and extra fluid, which go to your bladder as urine.

Chronic kidney disease happens when something goes wrong with this filtering process.
Usually this occurs because someone has had diabetes or high blood pressure for a
long time.



People with diabetes have too much glucose (sugar) in their blood. Over time this can harm the tiny blood
vessels that filter wastes in the kidneys. Diabetes is the most common cause of chronic
kidney disease.



High blood pressure can also damage these tiny blood vessels over time. This is the second most common
cause.



Other, less frequent causes include:


blockage in the renal arteries


kidney problems that develop in the womb


inherited diseases (such as polycystic kidney disease)


autoimmune diseases (such as lupus and scleroderma), and


being around toxic substances for a long time, including leaded paint and soldering
materials.



When the kidneys start losing their filtering ability, wastes and fluid build up.
This causes problems throughout the body.

Chronic kidney disease is different from acute kidney injury, which happens when your kidneys suddenly stop working properly. This can occur because
of a sudden drop in the blood flow to the kidneys, a sudden blockage of the urine
flow from the kidneys, or damage from some illnesses, drugs, or poisons.

Acute kidney injury can sometimes be reversed if the kidneys aren't badly damaged.
If you've had acute kidney injury you may have an increased chance of getting chronic
kidney disease and end-stage kidney disease in the future.

What are the symptoms?
Many people with chronic kidney disease don’t have any clear symptoms. In fact, symptoms
often don’t appear until there has been significant damage to the kidneys.

Possible symptoms include:


tiredness


nausea


urinating more or less often than usual


puffiness around your eyes or swelling in your limbs (this swelling is called oedema)


feeling generally ill


loss of appetite and weight loss


urine that appears foamy


dark-coloured urine (the colour of cola)


rashes and itching.


Many symptoms, such as tiredness and nausea, can also be caused by other conditions.
This can make chronic kidney disease difficult to diagnose.

If your doctor suspects that you could have kidney damage, he or she will test your
blood and urine for signs of damage, and to see how well your kidneys are filtering
out waste.

You might also need an ultrasound scan to spot kidney stones and other blockages, or a biopsy to look for signs of damage under a microscope. A biopsy is when a small amount of
tissue is extracted using a needle so that it can be examined under a microscope.

If you do have kidney damage your doctor will try to find out what caused it. This
is important, as treating the underlying cause can help prevent more damage.

What will happen to me?
Chronic kidney disease is a serious long-term illness that eventually leads to complications
and reduced life expectancy. But treatment can slow the progress of the disease and
many people live with the condition for many years.

The outlook is best if your kidney damage is discovered early. The sooner you start
treatment the sooner you can slow further damage.

But even people with advanced kidney disease can achieve a good quality of life by
closely following their doctor's advice and treatment plan.

Chronic fatigue syndrome is a frustrating and distressing illness that affects people
of all ages. No one knows what causes it and there is no cure. But there are things
you can try that may help you feel better.

What happens in chronic fatigue syndrome?
Many of us feel tired from time to time, especially if we are under stress with work
or personal problems, or if we just have busy lives.

But chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS for short) is different. People with CFS feel exhausted
and weak most of the time. It stops them getting on with their normal activities and
enjoying life.

It is thought that the lack of energy when you have CFS may be caused by problems
with your immune system or with the way energy is produced in your cells.

CFS is sometimes called myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME for short), or CFS/ME.
CFS can last from a few months to many years, although the symptoms may come and go
during that time. It can affect adults and children.

What are the symptoms?
A main symptom of CFS is feeling completely exhausted, and often unwell, after even
a small amount of activity. This differs from other chronic (long-term) conditions
that also involve fatigue. You may also:



feel tired and unrefreshed after sleeping


have trouble sleeping or concentrating


have muscle aches


have headaches


have a sore throat.


Doctors won't say that you have CFS until you have had the symptoms for 6 months (for
adults). For children, the diagnosis may be made after 3 months.

Sometimes CFS starts after another illness, such as a bad cold that seems to linger
for longer than it should. And some people find it starts during a time of stress.
But it can also come on gradually for no obvious reason.

If you are worried that you or your child may have CFS, see your doctor. There's no
simple test for CFS. But your doctor will ask you some questions about your general
health and your life, and will check whether your fatigue may be caused by anything
else. For example, you might have blood tests to check for an infection.

Other conditions that can cause tiredness include:


a long-lasting infection


anaemia (usually caused by a lack of iron)


problems with your thyroid gland


diabetes


depression


anorexia or bulimia


alcohol or drug abuse, and


ongoing stress.


Tiredness can also be caused by pregnancy or other hormonal changes, such as the menopause.
It is important for your doctor to be sure that no other problems are causing your
symptoms. If your symptoms are caused by something other than CFS it's important that
you get the right treatment. So you should tell your doctor about any other health
problems you have and about any other prescription and over-the-counter medicines
and supplements you are taking.

What treatments work?
We don't know what causes CFS so it's hard to know how to treat it, and there is no
cure. The aim of treatment is to ease the symptoms and help people live as normal
a life as possible.

Treatment without medicines
Multidisciplinary rehabilitation sounds complicated but the idea is quite simple. It's an approach that aims to combine
the benefits of several different treatments to help your recovery as much as possible.
The programme includes sessions with several types of therapist, including a physiotherapist
and an occupational therapist.

It includes elements of:


a form of psychotherapy (a 'talking treatment') called cognitive behaviour therapy
(CBT)



pacing (finding a balance between activity and rest)


relaxation therapy, which can help with things like getting regular sleep


therapy to help you deal with social situations


mindfulness.


You might have heard of or read about mindfulness in connection with other conditions,
such as stress. It aims to help you focus as calmly as possible on your present situation
(in this case your CFS) and accept it. The hope is that once you have accepted it
you can begin to make useful decisions based on what's best for your recovery.

Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) is a form of psychotherapy or 'talking treatment'. The idea is that the therapy will
help you to encourage positive thoughts and behaviours over negative ones. There is
some evidence that it can help people with CFS feel less tired and more positive.
CBT may also help children with CFS attend school more regularly.

When you have CBT you meet with a trained therapist for several sessions. There's
no evidence that CBT causes any harmful side effects.

There's some evidence that a graded aerobic exercise programme can help some people with mild fatigue feel less tired. It means starting
gently and building up your activity levels.

The important thing about exercise programmes is that they are tailored to each person's
needs and abilities. You should not be expected to do anything you don't feel capable
of doing. Doing too much exercise too soon is likely to make you feel worse than ever.

This is especially true if you have been immobile for a long time and your bones and
muscles are no longer used to exercise. You will need to take a very cautious and
gentle approach to exercise. Do only what you feel comfortable doing and stop when
you feel you need to stop.

Pacing aims to find the right balance, for you, between rest and the activities of everyday
life, including exercise. The idea is that if you use what limited energy you have
carefully, your energy will gradually increase. Pacing involves:



checking your energy and activity levels so that you can adjust your activity up or
down



dividing tasks and activities up into achievable 'chunks' rather than trying to do
too much at one time



taking control of decisions about your personal energy and activity levels rather
than following expert advice to the letter.



If you have CFS you will need support from your healthcare team to help you try to
increase how much you can do each day. Your symptoms may come and go, so you'll need
to plan each day's activities carefully and to try to save your energy for the things
that are most important to you. You'll need to schedule rest as needed and to work
with your team to try to help you to sleep better at night.

Treatment with medicines
There are no medicines that can treat the fatigue caused by CFS. But some people with
the condition take medicines to treat some of the symptoms.

As with other chronic conditions, about 4 in 10 people with CFS develop symptoms of
depression. Some people with CFS are prescribed antidepressants.

Some people are also prescribed medications to help with conditions that often occur
in people with CFS, such as disturbed sleep, pain, migraine, or irritable bowel syndrome.

What will happen to me?
CFS can last for years. And, although it's not medically dangerous, it can make you
feel very ill and miserable, and can interfere with your family, social, and work
life.

The good news is that most children recover completely. The outlook is less certain
for adults. Although a lot of people do gradually feel better, most still have periods
of feeling very tired. You may find it more difficult to recover if you are older,
if your symptoms are severe, or if you also have a mental health problem, such as
depression.

Where to get more help
Talking to other people with the condition, learning from their experiences, and feeling
as though you are not alone, can be crucial in living with and recovering from CFS.
And there are many charities and support groups that offer help.

For example, in the UK, the ME association (http://www.meassociation.org.uk/) and
Action for ME (https://www.actionforme.org.uk/) offer information and local support
to people with CFS. Your doctor may be able to suggest where to get help where you
live. Or you can search online."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1530963105198/Chlamydia,Chlamydia,"Chlamydia Last published: Oct 11, 2021
Chlamydia is an infection that is passed from person to person during sex. It is easily
treated. But if it isn't detected and treated it can cause serious health problems.
Practising safe sex can help you to avoid getting it.
We've brought together the best and most up-to-date research about chlamydia to see
what treatments work. You can use our information to talk to your doctor and decide
which treatments are best for you.

What happens in chlamydia?
Chlamydia is an infection caused by bacteria called Chlamydia trachomatis. You can catch chlamydia if you have sex with an infected person.


If you're a man it can affect the tube that carries urine down from your bladder to
the outside (the urethra). And it can sometimes affect the prostate.



If you're a woman it can affect the neck of your womb (cervix) or your urethra, or
both. It can sometimes also lead to other problems including pelvic inflammatory disease
(PID), a more widespread infection of the reproductive organs.



The infection can be passed on by oral sex and anal sex as well as by vaginal sex.
So it can also affect your throat and your rectum.



If you touch your eye after touching infected fluid from your genitals you can get
an eye infection.



Newborn babies also can be affected by chlamydia. This is because women who have the
infection can pass it on during childbirth. If you're pregnant and you have chlamydia
your baby may be born with eye infection or pneumonia. Both of these problems can
be treated with antibiotics.

What are the symptoms?
Chlamydia is sometimes called the 'silent disease' because you can have it without
knowing it. Many people who have chlamydia don't have any obvious signs of infection.

If you do get symptoms, you may get these if you're a woman:


Unusual discharge from your vagina


Bleeding between periods


Pain when passing urine


Pain in your lower abdomen.


If you're a man you might get:


Discharge from your penis


Burning and itching around your genitals


Pain when passing urine.


How do doctors diagnose it?
If you get symptoms like those listed above you should visit your doctor or your local
sexual health clinic. A sample of your urine or a swab will be tested for the infection.

If you're a woman the swab will be taken from your cervix. If you're a man the swab
will be taken from the tube that carries urine down from your bladder (urethra). If
you might have an infection in your throat or your rectum you'll probably also have
a throat swab or a rectal swab taken.

If the test shows you have chlamydia your last sex partner, and any other partners
you've had within the past few months, should be tested for chlamydia too.

Screening for chlamydia
Many countries now have national screening programmes for chlamydia for people considered
at high risk of infection. For example, in the UK, testing is offered to sexually
active people under 25 years of age. This is considered important because many people
have chlamydia without knowing it.

What treatments work?
If you have chlamydia, treatment with antibiotics can get rid of the infection. Antibiotics
are medicines that kill bacteria.

It's important not to have sex until you and your partner have finished your course
of antibiotics. With some antibiotics you may have to wait longer until you can have
sex. Your doctor will explain which antibiotics you are prescribed and what you need
to do to make sure they work best.

Antibiotics don't usually cause serious side effects. But after taking them some people
feel sick, or get an upset stomach, stomach pain, or diarrhoea.

If you're a pregnant woman
Some antibiotics are not considered safe to use during pregnancy. But there are others
that you can take. Your doctor will advise you about safe treatment for chlamydia
during pregnancy.

It's possible that taking antibiotics while pregnant might not prevent the infection
in your baby, even if they seem to clear up your infection.

What will happen to me?
Chlamydia is usually easy to treat with simple antibiotic tablets. But if it isn't
recognised and treated, chlamydia can spread. This can have serious effects on your
health. Many people feel embarrassed about visiting their doctor about a sexual issue
or about going to a sexual health clinic. But doctors and clinic staff deal with these
problems every day, and they are there to help you.

So if you think you have chlamydia or any sexually transmitted infection, see your
doctor or visit your local sexual health clinic as soon as possible.

If you're a woman
Chlamydia that isn't treated can spread to your ovaries, your womb, or the tubes that
lead from your ovaries to your womb (the fallopian tubes). When this happens it's
called pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).

Pelvic inflammatory disease can lead to blocked fallopian tubes, which can make it
hard for you to get pregnant. It can also cause an ectopic pregnancy. In an ectopic
pregnancy a fertilised egg starts growing in the fallopian tube.

Ectopic pregnancies are dangerous for the mother. The egg cannot develop into a baby
and usually has to be removed, either using drugs that end the pregnancy or with an
operation.

If you're a man
Chlamydia that isn't treated can lead to inflammation in the tubes leading to your
testicles or in the testicles.

You can also get a form of arthritis known as reactive arthritis.
What can I do to stop getting chlamydia again?
The best way to reduce your risk of getting infected with chlamydia again is to:


Use condoms when having sex, and make sure you're using them correctly


Get tested for chlamydia regularly.


Some people choose to be tested when starting a new relationship. They may also ask
their partner to be tested."

In many countries, including the UK, the chickenpox vaccine is not part of routine
vaccination schedules. But it is often available for people who have a high chance
of becoming infected, and of becoming seriously ill.

What is chickenpox?
Chickenpox in children
Chickenpox is a common infection. It is caused by a virus called varicella zoster. The most common symptoms are a mild fever and a rash, which usually clear up after a few days.

Most children catch chickenpox at a young age with no lasting effects. The illness is usually mild
and, after being infected, children are immune to the virus. So children who have already had chickenpox don’t need a vaccine.

Chickenpox in adults
Although chickenpox is almost always a mild illness in children, it can sometimes
be serious, especially for people who catch it as adults. This is why parents are
often keen for their children to get chickenpox as young children.

Complications of chickenpox, which are more common in adults, can include pneumonia and meningitis, which can both be fatal.

Chickenpox can be especially dangerous for pregnant women and their unborn babies.

Who needs the chickenpox vaccination?
In many countries, including the UK, chickenpox is not one of the infections that
are routinely vaccinated against in children.

But many countries offer the vaccine to:


people who have an increased chance of being infected as adults, and


people of any age who have an increased chance of serious complications if they become
infected.



For example, in the UK, the varicella vaccine is offered to:


healthcare workers who are not already immune, either by being vaccinated or by having
had chickenpox



those likely to come into contact with people who have weakened immune systems (such
as their family members). Examples of people with weakened immune systems include
those having chemotherapy treatment, and people with HIV or AIDS



people who work with children, and


military recruits.


Is there anyone who shouldn’t have the vaccine?
You should not have the vaccine if you:


are allergic to any of its ingredients


have a weakened immune system


are taking certain medicines that affect the immune system, or


are pregnant. The chickenpox vaccine contains small amounts of live chickenpox virus,
which is dangerous for pregnant women and their unborn babies.



The vaccine is also not recommended for very young babies.
Is it safe?
The chickenpox vaccine has been used for many years and no major safety concerns have
been found. But it can cause side effects in some people. These are usually mild and
short term. They include:



pain and redness where the injection is given (called the injection site)


a fever, and


a mild rash.


Very rarely, someone can have a severe allergic reaction (called anaphylaxis) to the vaccine. This happens to about one person in every one million who are vaccinated.
The staff giving the vaccine will have been trained in how to treat anaphylaxis.

How is the vaccination given?
The vaccine is given as an injection, usually into the upper arm. For the best protection,
you need two doses, which are given several weeks apart.

How well does the vaccine work?
The vaccine seems to work better in younger children than in teenagers and adults.
But it still gives immunity to most people who have both doses, and it appears to
offer good long-term protection."

Chickenpox is an infection that causes an itchy rash. It usually goes away after a
week or so, but it can make some people seriously ill.

What is chickenpox?
Chickenpox is caused by a virus called varicella zoster. It's passed from person to person easily. You can pass it on to other people for
a day or two before you even know you have it. Most people get chickenpox as children.
Once you've had it, you can't usually get it again.

What are the symptoms?
The main symptom of chickenpox is an itchy red rash, mainly on the body and the face.
You may also feel generally unwell and have a fever.

At first you'll get itchy spots that are filled with fluid. After a few days the spots
will turn into scabs. They don’t usually leave a scar unless they get infected. This
can happen if you scratch them.

What should I do if my child has chickenpox?
Children usually recover from chickenpox on their own. Some parents use calamine lotion
on their child to try to ease the itching. But there isn't any good evidence to show
that it really helps.

Paracetamol syrup may help with pain or a fever. But you shouldn't give aspirin to
children or teenagers under 16.

Most children are better in a week to 10 days. Your child will probably need to miss
about a week of school. Talk to your doctor if you're worried about your child for
any reason.

What if I'm pregnant?
If you're pregnant and you come into contact with someone who has chickenpox, there's
no problem as long as you've been vaccinated or you've had chickenpox before.

If you haven't, see a doctor straight away. The doctor can do a test to see if you
are immune to chickenpox: for example, if you are not sure whether you had it as a
child.

If you get chickenpox during pregnancy your doctor might recommend an antiviral drug.

Most women who get chickenpox while pregnant have a healthy baby. But if you get it
during the first six months of pregnancy there is a small chance it could harm your
baby.

About 1 in 50 babies whose mothers had chickenpox during this time have underdeveloped
arms or legs, brain damage, or eye problems.

If you get chickenpox late in your pregnancy, especially around the time you have
your baby, your baby could develop chickenpox. See a doctor if you get chickenpox
while pregnant or soon after giving birth.

What treatments are available?
Most children don't need treatment for chickenpox. For teenagers, adults, older people,
babies, pregnant women, or people with a weak immune system, chickenpox can be more
serious. You may need treatment.

If you are in one of these groups, see a doctor as soon as you can after coming into
contact with someone who has chickenpox.

You will probably be given antiviral medicines to help to fight the chickenpox virus. You take them as tablets.

The chickenpox vaccine
A vaccine can help prevent chickenpox, but not all countries include it in the routine
childhood schedules.

The vaccine is recommended for certain people if they haven't previously had chickenpox
or the vaccine. This includes healthcare workers and people in contact with someone
with a weak immune system (for example, someone who has a sister or brother with leukaemia).

If you're thinking of getting pregnant and have not had chickenpox before, you may
want to ask your doctor about the vaccine.

What to expect in the future?
Most people get better from chickenpox without any treatment. But the virus that causes
chickenpox stays in your body after you get it.

Some people who've had chickenpox get shingles later in their lives. Shingles is a painful rash around the body and face, which
sometimes affects the eyes. It happens when the chickenpox virus starts reproducing
in your nerve cells.

For more information see our leaflets: Shingles: what is it? and Shingles: what treatments work?
Chickenpox can be more serious for adults, babies, or people with a weak immune system.
Sometimes the rash gets infected, or people lose too much fluid (dehydration). Some
go on to get other illnesses such as a serious lung infection (pneumonia), nerve damage,
and liver damage.

Most airlines won't let people travel while they have chickenpox."

A chest drain is simply a tube that helps to remove air or fluid that has gathered
in your chest cavity, between your lungs and your ribs. It’s a common procedure that’s
used to help people with a number of conditions.

There is more than one type of chest drain. Here, we look at the one that’s most commonly
used in non-emergency situations.

What is a chest drain?
The area between your lungs and your ribcage is called the pleural space. It’s usually
filled with a small amount of fluid. But sometimes it can fill with too much fluid
(for example, from an infection) or with air, if there is damage to one of your lungs.

This makes it harder for you to breathe normally. So the air or fluid needs to be
removed quickly. This is done with a chest drain.

The drain is a flexible tube that is passed between two of your ribs. Any air in the
pleural space can then escape easily, and any fluid can be drained away.

Why might I need a chest drain?
A chest drain is needed to remove either air or fluid from the pleural space.
Air in the pleural space is caused by what doctors call a pneumothorax (collapsed lung). This means that there’s a tear in one of your lungs that is letting
air into the pleural space.

A build-up of fluid in the pleural space is called pleural effusion. It can be caused by many things, including:



a lung infection such as pneumonia or tuberculosis




heart failure




rheumatoid arthritis




cirrhosis of the liver




kidney failure




systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and




some cancers.


What will happen?
Before the procedure
Your doctor will check what medications, if any, you are taking.
If you are taking medication to stop your blood clotting too easily, you might need
to take medicine to temporarily make your blood clot normally. This is to stop you
bleeding too easily.

Your doctor might also do a scan, such as an ultrasound, to help guide where the drain
should be placed.

During the procedure
You lie on your back and put your hand (on the side that needs the chest drain) behind
your head. The doctor then has a good view of your ribs and chest.

Your doctor will then:


clean your chest with antiseptic




place a sheet over your chest. The sheet will have a section cut out of it, so that
the doctor can focus on where to place the drain





mark the point where the drain is going to go, between two of your ribs




give you an injection of local anaesthetic where the drain is going to go, to minimise
pain during the procedure





wait a few minutes for the anaesthetic to work.


That’s the first part of the procedure. The doctor will now:


give you another injection, with what’s called an introducer needle. This needle is
inserted until it reaches the pleural space





disconnect the introducer needle from the syringe that was used to insert it




pass a thin guide wire through the needle into the pleural space, and then remove
the needle. The guide wire will be used to guide the chest drain into the correct
place





make a small cut to enlarge the tiny hole where the needle and guide wire went into
your chest





use a small tube called a dilator to gently stretch the cut into a small circular
opening





thread the chest drain over the guide wire and pass it into your chest until it reaches
the pleural space





remove the guide wire




attach a drainage bottle to the drain, and secure the drain to your skin with an adhesive
dressing. Any fluid or air in the pleural space can now escape.



The doctor will then order a scan to check that the drain is in the right place.
What are the risks?
Inserting a chest drain can be a tricky procedure, and it should always be done by
someone with the right training and experience.

Even so, complications can happen, including:


pain when the drain is inserted. Even with a local anaesthetic, a chest drain can
sometimes be painful





the drain being placed incorrectly. If this happens, the doctor will need to do repeat
some or all of the procedure





damage to nearby organs, such as the liver, spleen, heart, or oesophagus




damage to blood vessels




air from the pleural space getting into other tissues, such as under the skin. This
isn’t usually dangerous





the chest drain becoming blocked and having to be reinserted




damage to the lung, causing a pneumothorax (collapsed lung)




creation of what’s called a fistula - a new passage for fluid to drain through, in
a place where it shouldn’t





infection.


What can I expect afterwards?
A doctor or nurse will need to regularly check how the drain is doing its job.
The drain will need to stay in place for as long as it’s needed, which is usually
at least 24 hours. After it’s removed you’ll need to have an x-ray to check for any
complications.

For many people, the chest drain works well to remove fluid or air from the pleural
space. But if the drain reveals a large volume of air or fluid, a drain alone is probably
not enough to deal with the problem, and you might need chest surgery."

Cervical cancer can nearly always be cured if it’s caught early. But when it’s diagnosed
in its later stages it’s often fatal. Cervical cancer screening helps prevent deaths
by finding cervical cancers before they spread.

You can talk to your doctor to find out more about screening and if you have any questions
about cervical cancer.

What is cervical cancer?
The cells that make up the organs in our bodies usually grow, die off, and replace
themselves in a regular way. But when cells grow out of control they can form clumps
called tumours. This is what we call cancer.

Cervical cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in women. The most commonly
affected age group is women in their 40s.

The cervix is the lower part of the uterus (womb). It sits between the lower part
of the uterus and the vagina. The cervix:



allows menstrual blood out of the uterus, and


funnels sperm from the vagina into the uterus during sex.


Cervical cancer is almost always caused by a virus called human papillomavirus, or HPV. HPV is spread through sexual contact. HPV and cervical cancer are more common in
women who:



become sexually active at a younger age, and


have multiple sexual partners.


Using condoms gives some protection against HPV, but the virus can spread through
general sexual contact, such as touching the genitals, as well as through intercourse.


There are more than 100 types of HPV, but only a few cause cervical cancer. Most women
will have some kind of HPV infection during their lives. But there aren’t any symptoms
and your immune system usually fights off the infection without you knowing it’s there.


Many countries have vaccination programmes to protect against the most dangerous types of HPV. For example, in England, girls
and boys are offered the vaccine in two stages starting at about age 12.

Many countries also have cervical cancer screening programmes that help detect cancers in their early stages. For example, in the UK:



women aged 25 to 49 are invited for screening every 3 years, and


women aged 50 to 64 are invited for screening every 5 years.


In cervical cancer screening (what used to be called a 'smear test' or 'PAP smear')
a small sample of cells is taken from the cervix and tested for cancer.

The test can be a bit uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t hurt. Most women are more worried
about feeling awkward and embarrassed than about pain. The test only takes a few minutes
and the end result is usually peace of mind.

Cervical cancer is almost always caused by HPV infection. But some things can make
it easier for the infection to trigger cancer. These include:



smoking


having a poor diet


taking the oral contraceptive pill, and


having a weak immune system.


If you have cervical cancer your specialist cancer doctor (an oncologist) will classify your cancer using staging. Staging is a system of letters and numbers that describes how far your cancer has
spread. It helps doctors decide which treatments would be the most useful for each
person’s cancer.

It’s a complicated system, but the basics are that:


stage 1 cancer is only in the cervix


stage 2 cancer has spread beyond the cervix into nearby tissues


stage 3 cancer has spread further outside the cervix - for example, into the vagina
- but not to other major organs or to distant parts of the body



stage 4 means that the cancer has spread beyond the pelvis into other organs, such
as the bladder or rectum. Cancer that has spread a long way is called metastatic cancer.



What are the symptoms?
Early-stage cervical cancer often has no symptoms. But some women notice symptoms
including:



pelvic pain


pain during sex


bleeding from the vagina after sex, or other abnormal vaginal bleeding


vaginal discharge


back pain


changes in menstrual periods.


Many symptoms of cervical cancer, such as abnormal bleeding, can be caused by other
things. So having these symptoms doesn’t usually mean that you have cancer. But if
you have any of them it’s best to see your doctor.

If your doctor thinks you might have cervical cancer he or she will arrange for you
to have a test called a colposcopy. This involves a specialist using a microscope with a light to look inside your vagina
through to your cervix.

The specialist then coats the cervix with special fluid, which shows up anything unusual.
A sample of any unusual tissue can then be taken and tested. This is called a biopsy.

What treatments are available?
The treatment you need will depend on how far your cancer has spread.
For example, very small cancers that have not spread beyond the cervix can almost
always be cured with surgery. But most metastatic cancer, where the cancer has spread
beyond the pelvis and into other parts of the body, are very hard to cure.

Whatever treatments you have, you should ask your treatment team any questions you
want to at any stage of your treatment. And remember, all decisions about your treatment
should reflect your wishes.

Very small tumours
Very small, early-stage cervical cancers are sometimes called micro-invasive cancers. These can almost always be cured by surgery to remove the cancer cells. Some women
also need to have some nearby glands (called lymph nodes) removed.

Broadly speaking, this is what your oncologist would call stage 1 cervical cancer.


There are two types of operation to cure cervical cancer at this very early stage.




Conisation means removing a cone-shaped section of the cervix containing the cancer cells.



Electrosurgical excision means removing the cancer cells with an electrical current.



Early-stage cervical cancer
Cancer that has grown beyond a small cluster of cells, but that is still fairly small
and still within the cervix, is called early-stage cervical cancer.

Broadly speaking, this description covers many stage 1 and stage 2 cancers.
The main treatment is surgery to remove the uterus (womb) and surrounding lymph nodes.
Some women also need treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy after this operation.



Chemotherapy means taking drugs that kill cancer cells.


Radiotherapy means targeting the tumour with radiation to kill the cancer cells.


Having both of these treatments works better than just having one. But they can both
cause side effects. For example:



radiotherapy can cause problems including infertility, pain when urinating, nausea,
and vomiting



chemotherapy can cause problems including hair loss, fatigue, nausea, and vomiting.




Your treatment team should explain all the possible side effects to you, as well as
which ones are only temporary and will go away when your treatment stops.

Some women with small early-stage cervical cancer who want to have children in the future might be able to have an operation called a trachelectomy. In this operation the surgeon removes the cervix and some nearby tissue, but not
the uterus.

Surgery is the simplest treatment for early-stage cervical cancer. But some early-stage
cancers are too large and have spread too far into the cervix to remove with surgery.


Women with this type of cancer can be treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
Your treatment team should explain to you what this means: for example, they should
explain:



how often you will need treatment


how long the course of treatment will last, and


what side effects you can expect.


Locally advanced cervical cancer
Locally advanced cancer has spread beyond the cervix into nearby tissues, and sometimes
into other organs, but not those a long way from the pelvis.

This description covers many cancers in stages 2, 3, and 4.
The treatment for locally advanced cervical cancer is chemotherapy and radiotherapy.


Metastatic cervical cancer
Metastatic cervical cancer has spread beyond the pelvis into organs such as the bladder,
bowel, or lungs.

All metastatic cervical cancers are classed as stage 4 cervical cancer.
The main treatment is chemotherapy with a combination of drugs. This is more effective
than using just one chemotherapy drug.

Some women with metastatic cancer can have other treatments. For example, some women
can have radiotherapy targeted in specific areas. And some women might be able to
have surgery to remove cancer from some places it has spread to.

Unfortunately, chemotherapy is not always successful. This might be because it doesn’t
work to shrink some tumours, or because the side effects are so severe that some women
would rather not continue with treatment.

For these women, the cancer cannot be cured, and they will be offered what’s called
supportive or palliative care. This means making you as comfortable as possible while
not having any more cancer treatment.

There can be many aspects to this type of care, from helping with your physical, emotional,
and spiritual needs to controlling pain and nausea. Your treatment team should explain
everything that might happen and everything that can be done.

Cervical cancer when you are pregnant
Cervical cancer is rare during pregnancy, but it does happen.
If you are diagnosed with cervical cancer while pregnant, you cannot usually have
surgery, you cannot have chemotherapy in the early months, and you cannot have radiotherapy
at all.

So you will face a hard choice: having cancer treatment as soon as possible will mean
losing the pregnancy. But if you choose to keep the pregnancy you will not be able
to have most cancer treatments until after you have the baby.

Your treatment team should explain all the options and give you the best advice and
treatment they can, whatever you choose. But the choice is yours.

What to expect in the future
After treatment to cure cervical cancer you will need follow-up tests every few months
for a while, and then every year. This is to check that the cancer has not returned.


Cervical cancer can have a major effect on your life, especially if you need a lot
of treatment. You might need a lot of time off work and a lot of time to recover,
physically and emotionally.

You should ask your treatment team any questions that you want to. For example, many
women want to know how they might feel different after surgery, or when it’s okay
to start having sex again.

Unfortunately, not everyone with cervical cancer can be cured. Survival largely depends
on how far the cancer has spread when it’s diagnosed.

Nearly all women whose cancer was diagnosed very early, or whose tumour was very small,
are alive 5 years later. (Remember, this doesn’t mean that they only live for 5 years.
It’s just that this is how long many follow-up studies last, for practical reasons.)

In women whose cancer has spread locally, but not beyond the cervix or uterus, more
than 90 in 100 will be alive 5 years later.

In women whose cancer has spread beyond the cervix or uterus into nearby lymph nodes,
about 55 in 100 will be alive 5 years later.

In women whose cancer has spread to the bladder or rectum, or beyond the pelvis to
other organs, only about 17 in 100 are alive 5 years later.

Many organisations provide support and information to women with cervical cancer and
their families. For example, if you live in the UK you might find Jo’s Cervical Cancer
Trust (jostrust.org.uk) a good place to start.

Your treatment team might be able to direct you to a support group where you live,
or you could search online."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/3000159/Cerebral%20palsy%3A%20what%20treatments%20work%3F,Cerebral palsy: what treatments work?,"Cerebral palsy: what treatments work? Last published: Dec 10, 2020
Cerebral palsy is a condition that can affect a baby’s brain when it is growing in
the womb, or shortly after birth. People with cerebral palsy can have a variety of
problems with movement and speech, and sometimes with learning difficulties.

What treatments work?
People with cerebral palsy (CP for short) have widely varying symptoms, and not everyone
with the condition has all of them. This means that treatment for CP needs to be different
for each person, depending on his or her abilities and needs.

Doctors often talk about there being four types of CP, depending on which symptoms
someone has. These types are:



spastic CP, where severe muscle stiffness (spasticity means stiffness) is the main symptom





dyskinetic CP, where the main symptom is called dyskinesia, which means that you have repeating
muscle movements that you can’t control





ataxic CP, where the main symptoms is called ataxia, which means a lack of balance and coordination,
and





mixed CP, where someone has symptoms of more than one of the types listed above.



There are different treatments for each type and symptom of CP. But treating someone
with CP tends to work best when it’s focused on what matters to that person.

For example, two people with CP might have similar symptoms but different energy levels
and different priorities. So one person might want to focus his or her energy on walking
and being as mobile as possible, while someone else might care most about communicating
better.

Young children
Children with CP can often be diagnosed as early as 6 months old. The first treatments
that young children have will be aimed at helping them reach the development targets
or “milestones” that children achieve in early life, such as crawling, walking, and
talking.

So young children with CP should get help with:


physiotherapy - helping them to move and stretch and, hopefully to crawl and walk.
It’s recommended that children start physiotherapy as early as possible





occupational therapy - this means help with the skills they need in daily life, such
as holding and exploring toys, books, and other objects, and feeding themselves





speech therapy.


School years and growing up
During school years, treatment is aimed at helping children to be as mobile and independent
as possible. This means working on areas such as:



therapy to help with daily physical activities (you might hear your doctor or therapist
use the phrase “activities of daily living”)





strengthening weak muscles




stretching exercises for stiff muscles affected by spasticity, and




special equipment where needed.


Some older children have surgery to help with problems with soft tissues and with
bones that haven’t grown in the right way.

In the teenage years and through to adulthood, the focus is on a healthy lifestyle.
This means staying fit and flexible, and keeping up with the most helpful exercise
programmes.

Adaptive equipment
As children get older their abilities and needs become clearer. Some children manage
many physical tasks without too much trouble. But some children will benefit from
special adaptive equipment.

Much of the equipment for people with CP is designed to help them to walk. This equipment
includes braces, crutches, canes, and walkers.

Some people find that it helps to practise on a piece of equipment called a gait trainer.
It looks a bit like a walker, but it surrounds you on all four sides, and it has straps
to guide the legs into a good position to improve strength and balance.

For people with CP who can’t walk, there are many mobility aids, including electric
and non-electric wheelchairs, specially adapted scooters, tricycles, and cars.

There are many other types of adaptive equipment, from modified cutlery and utensils,
to devices to help with unsteady handwriting.

Treatments for different types of cerebral palsy
Treatments for spasticity (stiff muscles)
Spasticity is complex, because it causes problems in two ways.
First, the stiffness itself needs regular therapy to keep your muscles as supple and
flexible as possible. And second, spasticity can gradually lead to longer-term problems,
including issues with:



sensation. Some children don’t sense things like touch and pain properly




the way they see things. For example, some children struggle with depth perception
- realising how near or far away something is





thinking clearly




communication




behaviour




controlling the bladder and bowels




acid reflux (heartburn)




producing too much saliva




eating, drinking, and swallowing, and




epilepsy.


This might look like a worrying list of possible problems. But many of them can be
treated if and when they happen.

There are many treatments for spasticity if and when you need them, including:


physiotherapy




occupational therapy




speech therapy, and




physiotherapy occupational therapy devices called orthoses. These are specially designed
braces that help keep parts of your body stable and in the right position: for example,
so that you can walk more easily. Orthoses can be used on the feet, ankles, knees,
and spine.



Orthoses for CP used to be bulky and heavy. But the modern ones are usually slim and
lightweight, and they can be made to fit you individually.

Some drug treatments can help with severe spasticity. These include:


medications that relax the muscles and help reduce stiffness and spasms, and


injections of botulinum toxin (botox) to reduce stiffness and pain.


Botulinum toxin is injected directly into the muscle area where it is needed and will
do most good. Many people find that it can help relieve symptoms for several weeks.


These medications can have side effects in some people. Your doctor should explain
these to you, and you should feel free to ask questions about any treatments.

Some people with severe spasticity take their medication through a special pump fitted
under the skin. Small doses are then delivered directly into the fluid around your
spine, where it can do the most good.

Surgery for spasticity
Some types of surgery can help with severe spasticity. For example, some children
have an operation on some of the nerves in the spine. This is called selective posterior
rhizotomy.

In this operation, nerves that are causing problems with muscle tone can be isolated
and cut. This reduces stiffness without affecting the ability to move. The reduced
stiffness also allows other nearby muscles to work in a more relaxed and regular way.


Another type of surgery for spasticity is an operation to lengthen the tendons in
the arms or legs. This makes walking and other movements easier and less stiff.

You can discuss any of these surgeries with your doctor if you think they might help
you or your child.

Treatments for dyskinesia
The physical treatments that work for spasticity also help with the problems with
muscle control that dyskinesia causes. So things like physiotherapy, speech therapy,
and orthoses are all essential.

Drug treatments are also sometimes used to help people with these symptoms.
A treatment called deep brain stimulation can also help some people with severe symptoms.
Tiny devices called electrodes are implanted in the brain. These then help to control
signals in the brain that cause irregular movements.

Treatments for ataxia
As with other types of CP, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and
orthoses are all essential in treating ataxia.

Physiotherapy for ataxia symptoms focuses on:


strengthening weaker muscles




coordination, and




balance.


Drug treatments are sometimes used to help with shaking caused by ataxia, and to improve
other symptoms. But there seems to be a limit to how much they help.

What will happen?
The outlook for someone with CP depends on how severe their physical and mental symptoms
are to begin with: for example, how well they can move, walk, and communicate.

But ongoing treatment can make a huge difference to how well some people can do these
things.

Lifelong treatment should include an ongoing exercise programme to help with strength,
flexibility, movement, balance, and bone strength. Many people with CP need to take
calcium and vitamin D supplements to help with bone strength.

A great deal of long-term therapy is also directed at helping people communicate as
well as possible.

Individual needs
Every person with CP has different abilities. So long-term treatment should be tailored
to what helps you (or your child) most.

For example: some people with CP can do most things for themselves, while some people
need some help, either from special equipment or from other people. And some people
with severe symptoms need to use a feeding tube.

You should have regular assessments to see how you’re doing. Young children, especially,
will be seen very often as they grow and develop.

The problems in the brain that cause CP don’t get worse over time. But people’s abilities
and needs often change. So, for example, the equipment and medication you need, or
the exercises that help you, might change from time to time.

Walking is obviously an important aim for many people with CP. But if trying hard
to walk leaves you too tired to do much else, you and your doctor might decide that
there are more important goals. Many people with CP direct their strength in other
areas, and use mobility aids to get around.

Technology can also be used to help with communication: for example, special computers
can allow people with severe physical symptoms to communicate in ways that were impossible
in the past.

School, work, and social life
Most children with CP go to mainstream schools. But some have special education needs,
and some need full-time helpers in the classroom.

People who have CP without any mental disability can often go through education and
into jobs and careers without problems. About 30 in 100 people with CP manage to work,
and about the same number can live independently.

But people with more serious physical symptoms or with mental impairment may not be
able to work. For these people, it’s often important to find ways to have a social
life and avoid isolation. Day programmes and specially arranged transport, for example,
help many people in this way.

Long-term outlook
Treatments for CP can make a big difference. But they can’t cure it. CP is a lifelong
condition. People with CP don’t tend to live as long as people without the condition.
But the difference is not as big as it used to be.

Life expectancy depends partly on how severe someone’s symptoms are. So someone who
doesn’t have severe symptoms can have a fairly normal life expectancy.

People with CP seem to be more likely than other people to have health problems such
as heart conditions and COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a condition that
affects the lungs).

This might be linked to people with CP being less able to exercise. So it’s important
to keep up with your physiotherapy and exercise as much as you can.

CP is common. And there are many charities and support groups for people with the
condition. For example, in the UK, Scope (scope.org.uk) has been offering practical
help, information, and companionship to people with CP for many years.

Cerebral palsy is a condition that can affect a baby’s brain when it is growing in
the womb, or shortly after birth. People with cerebral palsy can have a variety of
problems with movement and speech, and sometimes with learning difficulties.

The symptoms vary hugely, with some people unable to walk and talk, while others can
live independent working lives.

What is cerebral palsy?
Cerebral palsy (CP for short) is a brain condition that can develop while a baby is
developing in its mother’s womb or soon after birth. It affects 2 or 3 in every 1000
children and is the most common cause of disability in children.

CP continues into adulthood but, unlike some conditions that affect the brain, the
problems in the brain don’t get worse.

People with CP have varying symptoms, and not everyone with the condition has all
of them. But everyone with CP has some problems with movement. You might hear your
doctor call this 'motor impairment'.

For example, most people with CP have some level of what’s called spasticity.

This means that your muscles and tendons feel tight and stiff, as if they are constantly
pulling your limbs in close. It might help to think of spasticity as the opposite
of plasticity (from the word plastic, meaning stretchy).

Spasticity can cause symptoms ranging from mild to very severe. But everyone with
CP needs to do lifelong regular exercises to help keep their muscles as flexible as
possible.

Other common problems that affect people with CP include:


problems with eating and drinking. This happens because of problems with muscles in
the face and throat





trouble speaking




varying levels of mental disability (although this does not affect everyone with CP)




urinary incontinence (being unable to control your bladder), and




problems moving the limbs in a steady, coordinated way.


There is no one cause of CP. Babies’ brains are delicate when they are growing, and
many things can make CP more likely. These include:



multiple births. CP is more common in twins than in single births, and even more common
in triplets





premature birth. Babies born very early are more likely to have CP




some illnesses and infections in the mother




problems during birth, including long and difficult births, and if the baby has trouble
breathing during delivery





sepsis in the baby after birth. This is when the baby’s immune system over-reacts
to an infection and begins to harm the baby instead of protecting it





jaundice




head injuries in very young children, and




if a baby has seizures shortly after birth.


In about one third of children who develop CP, there is no known cause.
Complications of cerebral palsy
People with CP often have other problems as a result of having CP. These are called
complications. Common complications of CP include epilepsy, poor eyesight, hearing problems, weak
bones, and poor growth.

Many of these complications, such as weak bones and epilepsy, can be treated.
What are the symptoms?
Cerebral palsy is usually diagnosed in young children when they start to try to move
around. Children with CP might struggle to reach the 'milestones' as soon as other
children.

For example, most babies begin to sit up by themselves at about six months old, crawl
at about 9 months, and walk at between 12 and 18 months old. By two years old most
children talk in short sentences.

Of course, all children are different. And just because your child doesn’t do all
these things by these times, it doesn’t mean that he or she has CP or any other problem.


But if you are concerned about your child’s milestones, talk to your doctor.
If your doctor thinks that your child might have CP, he or she might suggest scans,
such as an x-ray to check for problems caused by spasticity, or a scan of the brain
to see how it is developing.

Doctors often talk about there being four types of CP, depending on which symptoms
someone has. These types are:



spastic CP, where spasticity (problems caused by severe muscle stiffness) is the
main symptom





dyskinetic CP, where the main symptom is called dyskinesia, which means that you have
repeating muscle movements that you can’t control





ataxic CP, where the main symptoms is ataxia, or a lack of balance and coordination,
and





mixed CP, where someone has symptoms of more than one of the three types listed above.


Spastic cerebral palsy
Spasticity is the most common symptom of CP. It can cause various problems in one
or more limbs, most commonly:



stiffness when trying to bend and stretch limbs




movements that are jerky and sudden, rather than smooth




sudden stiffness in muscles and limbs, which can be painful.


Over time, the effects of spasticity can lead to other problems as children grow.
These include problems with:



sensation. Some children don’t sense things like touch and pain properly the way they
see things. For example, some children struggle with depth perception - realising
how far away something is





thinking clearly




communication




behaviour




controlling the bladder and bowels




acid reflux (heartburn)




producing too much saliva




eating, drinking, and swallowing, and




epilepsy.


Dyskinetic cerebral palsy
People with this type of CP have trouble controlling the movements of their muscles.
Their muscles might move in repeated, jerky ways, and their general posture is often
twisted.

The physical effects of dyskinetic CP can be severe, but people with this type of
CP often don’t have problems with mental disability.

Ataxic cerebral palsy
People with ataxic CP have problems with coordination and rhythm. This means that
they can have problems such as:



poor balance




problems handling objects




difficulty talking and communicating




tremor (shaking)




a wide gait when walking (walking with the feet far apart). Many people with ataxic
CP have problems walking, and some cannot walk at all.





poor control over eye movements, and




weak muscles.


What will happen?
The outlook for someone with CP depends on how severe their physical and mental symptoms
are to begin with: for example, how well they can move, walk, and communicate.

But ongoing treatment can make a huge difference to how well some people can do these
things.

Lifelong treatment should include an ongoing exercise programme to help with strength,
flexibility, movement, balance, and bone strength.

Many people with CP need to take calcium and vitamin D supplements to help with bone
strength.

A great deal of long-term therapy is also aimed at helping people communicate as well
as possible.

Individual needs
Every person with CP has different abilities. So long-term treatment should be tailored
to what helps you (or your child) most.

For example: some people with CP can do most things for themselves, while some people
need some help, either from special equipment or from other people. And some people
with severe symptoms need to use a feeding tube.

You should have regular assessments to see how you’re doing. Young children, especially,
will be seen very often as they grow and develop.

The problems in the brain that cause CP don’t get worse over time. But people’s abilities
and needs often change. So, for example, the equipment and medication you need, or
the exercises that help you, might change from time to time.

Walking is obviously an important aim for many people with CP. But if trying hard
to walk leaves you too tired to do much else, you and your doctor might decide that
there are more important goals. Many people with CP direct their strength in other
areas, and use mobility aids to get around.

Technology can also be used to help with communication: for example, special computers
can allow people with severe physical symptoms to communicate in ways that were impossible
in the past.

School, work, and social life
Most children with CP go to mainstream schools. But some have special education needs,
and some need full-time helpers in the classroom.

People who have CP without any mental disability can often go through education and
into jobs and careers without problems. About 30 in 100 people with CP manage to work,
and about the same number can live independently.

But people with more serious physical symptoms or with mental impairment may not be
able to work. For these people, it’s often important to find ways to have a social
life and avoid isolation. Day programmes and specially arranged transport, for example,
help many people in this way.

Long-term outlook
Treatments for CP can make a big difference. But they can’t cure it. CP is a lifelong
condition. People with CP don’t tend to live as long as people without the condition.
But the difference is not as big as it used to be.

Life expectancy depends partly on how severe someone’s symptoms are. So someone who
doesn’t have severe symptoms can have a fairly normal life expectancy.

People with CP seem to be more likely than other people to have common health problems
such as heart conditions and COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a condition
that affects the lungs).

This might be linked to people with CP being less able to exercise. So it’s important
to keep up with your physiotherapy and exercise as much as you can.

Cellulitis and erysipelas are bacterial skin infections. They cause the infected area
to become red, inflamed, and sore. They're usually easy to cure with antibiotics.

What are cellulitis and erysipelas?
Cellulitis and erysipelas happen when germs called bacteria infect your skin. This
can happen if you have a cut or scrape, an open sore (ulcer), a cut from surgery,
or an insect bite.

Bacterial skin infections are also more likely to happen if you have a diabetic foot
ulcer or if your immune system is weakened.

Cellulitis and erysipelas are so similar that doctors can't always tell them apart.
The main difference is that cellulitis affects a deep layer of your skin. Erysipelas
affects your skin nearer the surface. Both conditions are treated the same way.

It's important to get treatment for these infections as soon as possible so that they
don't spread to other parts of your body. So if you have a painful rash it's best
to see a doctor as soon as possible.

If you get cellulitis around your eye, you need to get treatment right away. The infection
could spread and affect your eyes or your brain.

What are the symptoms?
Cellulitis and erysipelas make a patch of your skin turn red and feel sore. You're
most likely to get cellulitis on your legs or arms, but it can appear anywhere. Erysipelas
often affects the skin on the face.

The infection might spread over more of your skin, and the skin may blister. You may
also get swollen glands near the infection, or feel generally ill, as if you have
flu.

What treatments work?
Antibiotics cure cellulitis or erysipelas in most people who have the infection. They
kill the bacteria that are causing the skin infection.

You may need to start antibiotic treatment in hospital with a drip (also called an
intravenous infusion or IV). You'll switch to tablets when you start to get better.
But if your cellulitis is mild you might just be given tablets.

You'll probably need to take the tablets for one or two weeks. Children may be able
to take the antibiotics as a medicine or as chewable tablets.

As always with antibiotics, it's vital that you take them exactly as your doctor tells
you to. Don't stop taking them if your rash goes away and you feel better, but finish
all the tablets.

If you stop taking the pills part of the way through a course of antibiotics, some
of the bacteria could survive. These bacteria are then much harder to kill if they
cause another infection. Doctors call this 'antibiotic resistance' and it's a serious
and growing problem that is making many diseases harder to treat.

Most people who take antibiotics will notice that their symptoms have cleared up after
a week or so. But if your rash doesn't clear up, tell your doctor. You should have
a follow-up appointment with your doctor, whatever happens.

If your infection is not clearing up you may need a different antibiotic or further
tests. Or you might need to go to hospital to have more antibiotics by an IV drip.

Antibiotics can have side effects but they're usually mild. They include diarrhoea,
nausea, abdomen pain, headaches, dizziness, and a rash.

You may be given a painkiller, such as paracetamol. This can make you more comfortable
while you're waiting for the antibiotics to work.

If your cellulitis is on your leg or arm, you might be told to keep that limb higher
than the rest of your body. This is called elevation, and it can help the swelling
go down. If your skin starts to blister you may be given a dressing to put on it.

What will happen to me?
With treatment, most people who have cellulitis or erysipelas recover completely in
about two weeks. If you're usually healthy you may be treated at home. But some people
need hospital treatment. You may be able to go home after a day or two if you're feeling
better.

Sometimes cellulitis can spread and cause other problems (complications). These include
blood poisoning (sepsis), which is a severe infection that affects your whole body.
This is rare, but it may happen if the cellulitis isn't treated in time or if the
antibiotics don't work.

Cellulitis can also come back. Your doctor should advise you about things you can
do to help prevent further skin infections, such as making sure you keep cuts and
scrapes clean, and keeping patches of dry skin moisturised.

Some people get swelling in the arm or leg where they get cellulitis. This is called
lymphoedema. Treatment usually gets rid of the inflamed patch of skin, but in some
people the swelling doesn't go away."

Sometimes it’s necessary to have a catheter fitted to help you to pass urine - often
because you are having surgery. This leaflet tells you how and why it’s done, how
it helps, and if there are any possible problems.

You can use our information to talk with your doctor about your treatment.
What is a urethral catheter?
A urethral catheter is a thin rubber tube that’s placed into your urethra to help
you urinate. Your urethra is the tube that carries urine from your bladder down through your penis and out of
your body when you go to the toilet.

The catheter goes all the way along the urethra and into the bladder and allows urine
to pass easily out of the body.

Why might I need a urethral catheter?
There are several reasons why you might need to have a urethral catheter fitted. They
include:



having surgery in the area of your abdomen (tummy). You always need to have an empty
bladder if you are having any kind of surgery around your abdomen. A full bladder
can get in the way of your operation, and can easily be damaged if the surgeon is
operating on nearby tissue



if you suddenly find it hard to urinate, even though your bladder is full. This is
called acute urinary retention. This can have several causes, including damage to nerves or to the bladder itself






when your doctor needs to measure accurately how much urine your body is making. This
is usually because you are ill. Healthy urine production is one way of checking that
your body’s systems are working properly





bladder irrigation. This is when the bladder is rinsed out, to clear away material
such as blood clots





bladder instillation. Medications are pumped gently into the bladder through the catheter
to help treat the symptoms of cystitis, such as pain and burning





a bladder obstruction. Several medical conditions can cause a bladder obstruction.
This tends to be more common in men.



What will happen?
To have the catheter fitted, you need to be undressed and lying on your back.
Before fitting the catheter your doctor will give you a local anaesthetic so that
you don’t feel any pain. This is done by pumping anaesthetic gel into the urethra,
at the top of your penis. It’s done with a syringe, but there’s no needle and no puncture
of the skin.

The doctor will wait for a minute or so, for the anaesthetic to start working. He
or she will then:



insert the tip of the catheter into the end of your penis




guide the catheter into the urethra with steady, gentle pressure




wait until urine appears at the end of the catheter. When this happens, the doctor
knows that the catheter is in the bladder. He or she will guide it a little farther
in, so that it’s as secure as possible





pump a small amount of sterile water into the catheter. This inflates a small balloon
at the end of the catheter that’s in your bladder, which stops it from falling out





attach a bag to the end of the catheter to collect the urine that you pass.


Some people need to have catheters fitted to help with long-term medical conditions.
But in most cases the catheter will be removed as soon as you no longer need it, to
reduce the chance of an infection.

If you need to have your catheter in place for more than a short time, and you are
able to walk, the collection bag can be simply attached to your leg, so that you can
walk around.

If you need to have a long-term catheter, it will need to be changed every few weeks.
What are the risks?
Having a catheter fitted shouldn’t hurt, because of the local anaesthetic. But it
can feel a little uncomfortable. There are several other possible complications that
your doctor should discuss with you before the procedure, including:



urinary tract infection (UTI). All the equipment your doctor uses will be sterile.
But infections do still happen sometimes. If you get a UTI you might need antibiotics
to treat it





bleeding. A small amount of bleeding is common after having a catheter fitted. It
usually stops by itself. But sometimes the bleeding can be heavier and take longer
to stop





a blocked catheter. Material from inside the bladder or urethra, such as a blood clot,
can sometimes block the catheter. If this happens, you will need to have a new catheter
fitted."

Cataracts affect your eyes and can make your vision cloudy. However, they develop
slowly and may not bother you much at first. But once cataracts start affecting your
eyesight and how you live your life, you may want to have surgery to remove them.

This information tells you what you can expect from cataract surgery, and aims to
help you decide whether surgery is right for you.

What are cataracts?
Cataracts are common, especially in older people.
If you have a cataract, the lens in your eye has become cloudy. This makes your vision
blurry. Cataracts usually affect both eyes, although you can get them in just one
eye.

Many people think that a cataract grows on the surface of the eye. But cataracts actually
affect the lens, which is inside your eye, just behind the coloured part (the iris).

Cataracts usually develop because of changes to the eye that happen as we get older.
But cataracts can also be caused by:



an injury to the eye


certain health problems (such as diabetes), and


certain medicines (such as long-term use of corticosteroid eye drops).


What treatments work?
Surgery is the only way to get rid of a cataract. During cataract surgery, a surgeon
removes the cloudy lens in the eye and usually replaces it with an artificial one.
It’s a simple operation that often takes only 5 minutes to 15 minutes. You'll usually
be able to go home the same day as the surgery.

For the operation, you will lie on a bed that has a pillow to hold your head still.
A doctor or nurse will numb your eye with anaesthetic drops or an injection near your
eye. This means you'll be awake during your operation, but you won't feel any pain.

You may also have a medicine to help you relax. Very occasionally, people have a general
anaesthetic so that they are asleep during the operation.

You'll have to lie still and not speak during the operation. A nurse will tell you
how to signal if you feel uncomfortable. During surgery, you may see flashes or catch
a glimpse of the surgical instruments. People don't usually find these things unpleasant.

There are two ways to do the operation. Your eye surgeon can take out your lens in
one piece through a cut in your eye. Or he or she can use sound waves to break up
the lens through a smaller cut.

The pieces are then sucked out through the cut in your eye, using a hollow needle.
Research suggests that surgery that breaks up the lens works better, and it's the
type that's most often used.

Once your old lens has been removed, your eye surgeon will probably put a clear, plastic
lens into your eye. It shouldn't feel any different from your natural lens.

Sometimes people don't have a new lens put in, although this tends to happen in countries
with limited medical resources. To make up for this missing lens, the person then
has to wear special glasses or contact lenses.

After your operation you'll need to keep your eye protected from water and debris
for at least the first week, and put drops in your eye every day for several days
or weeks.

Your surgeon may also recommend wearing a bandage or shield over your eye at night
during the first week. If you have cataracts in both eyes, it's normal to treat them
in separate operations, one or two months apart.

How can cataract surgery help me?
After your operation you should be able to see better. Most people who have a cataract
operation can see well enough to drive.

Seeing better may help you to enjoy life more. And there's research that shows you're
less likely to hurt yourself in an accident or fall after having cataract surgery.

It may be a few days before you get the full benefit of cataract surgery. Even then,
you're unlikely to have perfect eyesight. Many people still need to wear glasses or
contacts.

Most artificial lenses used in cataract surgery can't change focus. That means you'll
need to have different glasses for either reading or for seeing long distances. However,
newer artificial lenses that can change focus are becoming more widely available.
They're called multi-focal and accommodating lenses.

Some research has found that they can change focus and give you clearer vision than
the older types of artificial lens. But they may sometimes have drawbacks, such as
halos around objects and glare. If your doctor suggests one of these newer lenses,
he or she should explain all the risks and benefits.

If you have another eye problem as well as cataracts, it may affect how well your
operation works. Your doctor can advise you about what the benefits are likely to
be for you.

What are the risks?
Like any operation, cataract surgery carries risks, including the chance of bleeding
and eye damage. However, serious problems are rare.

Some people have mild problems a couple of days after their operation. These include
bruising, pain, inflammation (swelling), or an infection. These are usually easy to
treat.

Some problems can happen months or even years after your operation. Cataracts can't
grow back, but sometimes the tissue around the new lens turns cloudy. This happens
to about 10 in every 100 people. It can be treated with laser surgery.

It's possible to get a detached retina after cataract surgery, although this isn't
common. A detached retina can damage your eyesight badly, and needs emergency surgery.
If you start to get problems with your vision, get help urgently.

What will happen if I choose not to have surgery?
If you don't have an operation your sight will gradually get poorer. But cataracts
usually get worse very slowly, so there’s no need to rush into a decision about treatment.

You may find your symptoms don't bother you. If your cataract isn't interfering with
your life, you may choose not to have an operation straight away.

How do I decide?
An eye test can give you an idea of how good your vision is. But doctors don't tend
to recommend surgery just based on your eye test. They usually suggest you think about
the way you live your life.

For example, if you enjoy playing golf or reading, or you need to drive a car, you
may want to have cataract surgery sooner. If your main hobby is listening to music,
you may prefer to put off having treatment.

If you choose not to have treatment now, you can always change your mind in the future
if your cataracts start to bother you. There's no need to wait until cataracts get
very bad before you have surgery. It's up to you to decide when they're bad enough
for you to want treatment.

Although your sight is likely to be better after you've had a cataract removed, you'll
probably still need to wear glasses or contact lenses. So if you can still see well
enough with glasses to do the things you want to do, you may want to put off having
surgery.

Some people have another eye problem that needs treating. For example, blood vessels
in the eye can be damaged by diabetes or by a condition called macular degeneration.
If you need surgery for one of these conditions, it may make sense to have your cataract
treated too.

Sometimes having another eye condition can mean you won't get much benefit out of
cataract surgery. And if your health is generally poor, surgery may have more risks.
If this is the case, you may think it's better to avoid having the operation.

If you decide to put off having surgery there are things you can try to make your
life easier.

Get new glasses if you need them, as this can make the most of the sight you have:


Brighter lighting in your home may help.


Anti-glare sunglasses or a hat with a brim can stop glare from lights or the sun bothering
you so much.



Magnifying glasses can make reading easier."

in your eye. It explains how the operation is done, how it can help, what the risks
are, and what to expect afterwards.

You can use our information to talk to your doctor about cataract surgery and other
treatments that might help you.

What is cataract surgery?
In your eye, the lens sits behind the coloured part (the iris) and helps you to see
things in focus.

If you have a cataract, it means that the lens has become cloudy. This makes your
vision blurred, like looking through frosted glass.

In a cataract operation your eye surgeon will remove the cloudy lens and put a clear,
artificial lens in its place.

Many people have worse eyesight as they get older. About one-third of people aged
over 65 have cataracts in one or both eyes. But not everyone with cataracts needs
surgery.

Why might I need cataract surgery?
Cataract surgery can help you to:


see things in focus


look into bright light with less glare: this can help if you have problems driving
because of the glare from vehicle headlights



tell the difference between colors


do things that your poor vision has stopped you from doing, such as driving, watching
TV, reading, and working.



Doctors don’t recommend cataract surgery just because someone’s eyesight reaches a
particular score on a sight test. Instead they look at whether your vision is affecting
your quality of life, and stopping you from doing normal daily activities.

For example, if your work or your leisure activities require fairly good vision, then
a cataract operation might be a good idea. On the other hand, if your main interest
is listening to music, and you don’t drive, having better vision might not be a priority.

There are other reasons why a cataract operation might help you. For example:


cataracts get worse over time and are a leading cause of blindness if not treated.
This doesn’t mean that you’ll go blind - cataracts usually get worse very slowly,
so you might never need treatment. But it’s important to bear the problem in mind,
and to see your optician or doctor if you are concerned



poorer vision when you’re older can make you more likely to have a fall. Improving
your vision can help prevent falls



you might need treatment for another vision problem, such as macular degeneration
(when the blood supply to an eye becomes reduced) or diabetic retinopathy (vision
problems caused by diabetes), and a cataract is in the way and needs to be removed
first.



If you need to have cataracts removed from both eyes, you will need to have two separate
operations about 6 weeks apart.

What will happen?
A cataract operation usually lasts between 10 and 20 minutes. It’s usually done under
local anaesthetic and most people are able to go home the same day.

You’ll usually only need to stay overnight if you have other problems with your eyes,
or if you have problems after the operation.

Before the operation
Unlike with many types of surgery, you probably won't need to change out of your normal
clothes for this operation. And you can probably walk to the operating theatre. Once
you're there:



you will be asked to lie down on a trolley or bed that has a special pillow to hold
your head still



your face will be covered with sheets to keep germs out of your eye, with a space
so that you can breathe



a doctor or nurse will numb your eye with anaesthetic eye drops or gel, or with an
injection. This might sting a little, but the operation will be painless



the area around your eye and your eyelashes will be cleaned with an antiseptic


you'll need to lie still and not speak. But a nurse will explain how to signal if
you feel uncomfortable.



During the operation
Surgery to remove a cataract is called phacoemulsification. The surgeon removes the cloudy lens and replaces it with an artificial lens called
an intraocular lens (IOL).

During this operation the surgeon makes a small cut in the clear, thin film (called
the cornea) that covers your eye. The cut is between 2 and 3 millimetres long. It
isn't painful and heals very quickly. After the surgeon has made the cut:



the surgeon inserts a tool with a fine needle through the cut to reach the lens inside
your eye



this tool gives off high-energy ultrasound waves. These sound waves break down the
lens into small pieces. These pieces are then sucked out through the centre of the
needle



the surgeon puts the artificial lens into your eye


the small cut in your cornea should heal on its own without stitches.


You might have to wear a pad over your eye for the first day or so, to protect your
eye.

Different types of lens
There are several types of lens that can be inserted to replace a lens with a cataract.
They might not all be available where you are, or some of them might involve extra
cost.



Monofocal lenses are probably the most commonly used type. These are simple lenses that work well.
But they don’t change focus the way that a younger person’s real lens does.

This type of lens is made for either close or distance vision, but not both. So if
you have this type of lens for distance vision, you’ll probably have to wear glasses
to read.



Accommodating lenses are designed to be flexible so that they can change focus, like the eye's natural
lens. But it’s not clear how well they work, and it’s unlikely that they will focus
as well as a healthy natural lens.



Multifocal lenses are also designed to focus for both close and distance vision. But they are also
unlikely to focus as well as a healthy natural lens.



Whatever type of lens you choose, you might have to wear glasses some of the time.


What are the risks?
As with all operations, there are risks with cataract surgery.
Most problems are mild and can be treated. But serious problems do happen. For example,
some people have much worse vision, or none at all, after the operation. This happens
in about 1 in every 1000 people.

The list of possible complications below might look long and worrying. But remember,
these are only things that might happen. Many people have no problems at all.

Problems that can happen during the operation


Heavy bleeding during the operation is rare but it can happen, and it can cause vision
damage.



The capsule that supports the lens inside your eye can tear or break during the operation.
This can leave your vision worse than before.



A piece of the lens with the cataract can break off and become lost in the eye. If
this happens you will probably need another operation to remove the lost piece of
lens.



Problems that can happen soon after the operation
Some complications don’t happen until a little while after the operation. The most
serious of these is an infection inside the eye. This is called endophthalmitis. This
is rare, but very serious. The infection should be treated with antibiotics right
away.

Other problems are usually mild and clear up by themselves, or they can be easily
treated. These problems include:



swelling of the cornea (the film that covers the front of your eye). This usually
gets better by itself. But some people need an operation to have a new cornea implanted



increased pressure in the eye. This is treated with eye drops


inflammation (swelling) of the front part of the eye. This is called uveitis. It usually
gets better by itself, but some people need eye drops



swelling of the retina (the light-sensitive tissue at the back of your eye). Your
sight will become cloudy a couple of weeks after your operation. This usually goes
away by itself, but it can sometimes cause some sight loss.



Problems that can happen some time after the operation
Some complications don’t happen for months or even years after the operation. These
include:



a cloudy lens capsule. This is called posterior capsular opacification, or PCO. This
problem is fairly common and can be treated with a minor operation using a laser beam



detached retina. This means that the retina comes away from the back of your eyeball
or is torn. It's rare but very serious if not treated, and you’ll need an operation
to fix it.



What can I expect afterwards?
You will be able to go home soon after the operation. If you've had a sedative you'll
need someone to stay with you for 24 hours.

Your eye might feel a bit uncomfortable and itchy for a couple of days, and you might
be sensitive to bright light for a while. You should be able to read or watch TV almost
straight away. But your vision may be blurry at first.

You'll need to use eye drops for several days or weeks to prevent infection and reduce
any swelling. You might also have a follow-up appointment soon after your operation,
so your doctor can check for any problems.

Your eye surgeon will give you advice at the follow-up appointment about when it's
safe to drive. But you’ll need to check the rules about how well you need to see in
order to drive."

If you have carpal tunnel syndrome, you may get numbness or tingling in your thumb
and fingers. You may also have aching in your wrist. Treatment can often relieve the
symptoms and help prevent long-term damage.

You can use our information to talk to your doctor and decide which treatments are
best for you.

What is carpal tunnel syndrome?
Your carpal tunnel is a narrow gap between the bones inside your wrist. The nerve
that carries messages between your brain and your hand runs through this gap. If you
have carpal tunnel syndrome, the gap gets narrower and squeezes this nerve.

Although some illnesses, such as rheumatoid arthritis, can cause carpal tunnel syndrome,
it's often not possible to say why someone gets carpal tunnel syndrome. But we do
know that certain things can make it more likely. These include:



being a woman


being over 30 years old


being overweight


having a job that involves a lot of bending or twisting of the hands or wrists, and


working with vibrating tools.


Women sometimes get carpal tunnel syndrome while pregnant, but it usually goes away
after they give birth.

What are the symptoms?
Symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome can include:


numbness, tingling, burning, or aching pains in your wrist, hand, and fingers


a weak grip, which might cause you to drop things


pain that gets worse when you make repetitive movements, or when you hold your hand
in one position: for example, when holding a book or phone, and



numbness and pain that wake you up at night.


Carpal tunnel syndrome can affect both your hands. If it does, the hand you use most
(your right hand if you're right-handed) will probably be worse.

To diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome, your doctor will ask you about your symptoms and
examine your wrist and hand.

You may also have a test that measures the electrical activity of your nerves and
muscles to confirm that you have carpal tunnel syndrome (and not another condition)
and to see how bad it is. You may hear this test called an electromyogram.

What treatments are available?
Carpal tunnel syndrome that's left untreated can sometimes cause permanent damage.
So it's important to get treatment as early as possible.

Two of the main treatments for carpal tunnel syndrome are wrist splints and injections of corticosteroids.

If splints and corticosteroid injections don't help - or if your carpal tunnel syndrome
is severe - your doctor may recommend surgery.

Some treatments for carpal tunnel syndrome, such as medicines, aren't usually given
to women who are pregnant. But splints can be helpful.

Splints
Your doctor may suggest wearing a splint at night to stop your wrist bending. Your
doctor will probably recommend wearing a splint at night for at least one month, and
for longer if it helps.

Research suggests that about 70 in 100 people find splints helpful.
Wearing a splint during the day as well doesn't seem to help any more than just wearing
it at night. However, your doctor may recommend limiting any activities during the
day that make your symptoms worse.

You can buy ready-made wrist splints, or you can have one custom made to fit your
wrist. You can discuss your options with your doctor.

Corticosteroid injections
If splints alone aren't helping enough, your doctor may recommend also having an injection
of a medicine called a corticosteroid into your wrist. These drugs are powerful anti-inflammatories
that can help reduce any swelling that is putting pressure on the nerves in your wrist.

Research suggests that between 60 and 70 in 100 people who have these injections find
them helpful within a few weeks. These improvements can last for several months.

These injections can sometimes damage the tendons or nerves in the wrist. Your doctor
should discuss the possible risks with you before you have this treatment.

Surgery
Surgery can take the pressure off the nerve in your wrist if you have more severe
carpal tunnel syndrome or if other treatments haven't worked.

This surgery doesn't seem to help everyone. But between 80 and 90 in 100 people who
have this surgery find that it helps.

You will be awake during the surgery but you will be given a local anaesthetic to
make your wrist numb.

Doctors can do the operation through a cut at the base of your hand, which will be
about 5 centimetres (2 inches) long. Or they can use keyhole surgery, which is done
through smaller cuts with the help of a tiny camera.

Both operations work about as well as each other, but having keyhole surgery may mean
you'll recover a bit faster.

You should be able to go home the same day as your operation. Like any operation,
this surgery can have side effects in some people. These side effects are usually
mild and temporary. They can include:



nerve damage


numbness


weakness in your hand, and


pain in the scar.


What to expect in the future
Many people with carpal tunnel syndrome find that their symptoms get slowly worse.
But this can take several years. Carpal tunnel syndrome can also get better for periods
of time, especially after pregnancy.

But don't ignore your symptoms. After a while, if the nerve becomes more damaged it
may actually be harder to notice that something is wrong. If you have any numbness,
tingling, pain, or weakness in your hand or wrist, see your doctor. Most people will
get better with treatment."

Carotid artery stenosis happens when the arteries that supply blood to parts of the
brain become too narrow. This can lead to a stroke. But there are treatments that
can help prevent this happening, including medicines and surgery.

There is also plenty that you can do by yourself to help keep your arteries healthy.
You can use our information to talk to your doctor and decide which treatments are
right for you. To learn more about what happens in carotid artery stenosis and how
doctors diagnose this condition, see Carotid artery stenosis: what is it?

Medicines
The main medicines for treating carotid artery stenosis are drugs that reduce the
chance of clots forming in your blood, such as aspirin. Aspirin isn’t suitable for
everyone. But other drugs are available.

Your doctor might also suggest medicines to help control your blood pressure and lower
your cholesterol. Keeping these things under control can help prevent strokes.

If you are already taking medicines for heart or circulation problems, your doctor
should carefully consider what extra medicines you might take to treat carotid artery
stenosis.

What can I do to help myself?
Many people find out that they have carotid artery stenosis only after they've had
a stroke or mini-stroke. But whether you’ve already had a stroke or not, there is
plenty that you can do to keep your arteries healthy and reduce your chances of a
future stroke.

Making changes to your lifestyle can help lower your blood pressure and your cholesterol
level, and improve your overall health. But you'll still need to take the medicines
that your doctor has prescribed.



If you smoke, your doctor will strongly suggest that you try to stop. Smoking damages
your blood vessels and makes a stroke more likely. Your doctor or pharmacist can give
you advice on giving up smoking.



If you're overweight it's a good idea to try to get to a healthier weight. Being physically
active can help.

Doing at least 30 minutes of exercise on most days is a good target. But you should
talk with your doctor about what type and amount of exercise is safest and most useful
for you. Many people find that walking briskly is the most convenient thing to do.

Even if you don’t lose a lot of weight there are many health benefits to regular exercise,
especially for your heart and blood vessels.

If you’ve had a stroke you may be limited in the types of exercise you can do. Your
doctor can advise you on what’s safe and practical.





As well as keeping active it’s important to eat a healthy diet. Try to eat at least
five portions of fruit and vegetables each day. Avoid eating lots of salt, sugar,
animal fats, and processed foods. If you drink alcohol you might want to think about
drinking less.



If you have another medical condition, such as a heart problem, try to make sure it's
kept under control. Not taking your treatment for other conditions may also affect
your chance of a stroke.

Surgery
If your carotid artery stenosis is severe, or if you have had a stroke or mini stroke,
your doctor might suggest surgery. There are two types of operation for treating carotid
artery stenosis.

The most common operation used to unblock a narrowed carotid artery is called carotid endarterectomy. In this operation:



the surgeon makes a cut (incision) between your jaw and your breastbone


he or she can then reach in and make a small cut along the section of the artery that
has become narrowed





the build-up of fatty substances that caused the narrowing (called plaques) can then
be removed from the artery.



This procedure can be done with a general anaesthetic, which means you are not awake.
But some surgeons prefer to use a local anaesthetic, which means you are awake but
the area being operated on is numbed so you don’t feel any pain.

Your surgeon might do this so that he or she can check how your brain is responding
to the changes in your blood flow during the operation.

Most people recover fully from this procedure within a few days. However, as with
all operations, carotid endarterectomy carries some risks. You should discuss with
your doctor the possible benefits and risks for you, before deciding to have this
treatment.

The second type of operation for carotid artery stenosis is called carotid stenting. Doctors usually only suggest this for people who are not suitable for endarterectomy
(for example, because of the location of their stenosis) or for those who have had
treatment before and whose stenosis has come back.

Stenting involves a surgeon putting a small tube inside your carotid artery to keep
it open so that the blood can flow properly. The tube stays there for the rest of
your life.

Like carotid endarterectomy, stenting is not a major operation, but it is a serious
one, and it carries risks. Most people recover well, but complications such as dangerous
blockages and blood clots sometimes happen.

As always with surgery, you should discuss the possible benefits and risks with your
doctor first.

What will happen to me?
If you have carotid artery stenosis you have an increased chance of having a stroke.
But if you are having treatment and making any necessary lifestyle changes, then you
are doing a lot to reduce your risk."

Carotid artery stenosis is a condition that can increase your chances of having a
stroke. But treatments can greatly reduce your risk. Here, we look at the condition
and how it is diagnosed. To read about treatments, see the leaflet Carotid artery stenosis: what treatments work?

What happens in carotid artery stenosis?
The carotid arteries are blood vessels that supply oxygen-rich blood to parts of your
brain. You can feel the pulse in these arteries with your fingers on either side of
your neck, just below your jaw.

If you have carotid artery stenosis (sometimes called carotid artery disease) it means
that your carotid arteries have narrowed, usually because of a build-up of fatty substances
called plaques. This can cause a stroke. Preventing strokes is the main reason for
treating carotid artery stenosis.

Certain things increase your chance of getting carotid artery stenosis (doctors call
them ‘risk factors’). They are some of the same things that increase your chance of
other problems that affect your heart and blood vessels. These include:



Being older


Smoking


Having other problems with your heart or blood vessels (cardiovascular disease)


Having high blood pressure


Having high cholesterol.


If your doctor thinks you might have carotid artery stenosis they will probably do
a test called an ultrasound. This is a scan that can show how well blood is flowing through your arteries and
whether they have become narrowed.

A doctor passes the ultrasound probe over the area of your body they want to test.
Information from the probe can then be seen on a screen. The scan doesn’t hurt. It
can take up to 45 minutes.

There are other types of scans that can help show if you have carotid artery stenosis,
but ultrasound is the one most commonly used. Your doctor can also use a stethoscope
to listen to the blood flow in your neck for an abnormal sound (called a cervical
bruit). This sound isn’t proof that you have stenosis, but if your doctor hears it
they will want to look at you more closely.

What are the symptoms?
Most people don’t have symptoms at all. But doctors often check for carotid artery
stenosis if they think someone is at high risk of having it, and if they hear a cervical
bruit.

But many people won’t know they have carotid artery stenosis until they have a stroke
or a ‘mini stroke’ (called a transient ischaemic attack or TIA).

Strokes usually happen quickly and without any warning. The symptoms can be serious.
But the symptoms someone has in the first few days after a stroke might not last forever.
When someone has a stroke:



They might feel weak or numb on one side of their body


They might feel dizzy and have trouble walking


One side of their face might droop


They might have problems with their vision, or trouble speaking or swallowing


They might pass out


They might have a severe headache.


The symptoms of a mini stroke are similar to those of a stroke but they don’t last
as long. They might last only a few minutes and they stop within 24 hours. But it’s
important to get medical help straight away, even if the symptoms stop quickly.

About 10 in 100 people who have a stroke die from it and many others are unable to
live a normal life afterwards. So doing all you can to avoid a stroke is important.


What will happen to me?
If you have carotid artery stenosis you have an increased chance of having a stroke.
But treatments and lifestyle changes can do a lot to lower your risk. To learn more,

People with Alzheimer's disease or another type of dementia gradually lose the ability
to look after themselves. Their personality also changes.
It can be heartbreaking to watch a person close to you change in this way. There will
also probably be times when it seems as if they're being deliberately difficult. But
it’s important to remember that your relative or loved one can't help their behaviour.
You might find it helpful to try to relate to what the person is feeling, rather than
what they're saying. For example, if someone thinks their things are being stolen,
it might be because they are anxious about forgetting where they've put things.

You could try putting labels on things, or making sure things are always put away
in the same place.

If your loved one or relative has delusions or hallucinations, there's no point in trying to persuade them that the things they think are happening
aren't real (although you shouldn’t actively agree that the things are happening either).

It's better to gently distract or reassure them than argue. Simple things, like going
for a drive or listening to music, may help.

You also need to make sure you have some time to yourself. It might help to have a
few days away every so often. You might consider respite care, where your loved one
spends a few days in a care facility.

You might feel guilty about doing this. But looking after your own needs will help
you take better care of your loved one, and help you from becoming stressed or depressed.

There will probably be a time when you need to think about getting regular help. This
could be extra help at home, or in a residential care home or a nursing home.



Help at home can include help with washing, dressing, shopping, and cooking, as well
as practical aids to make it easier for someone with dementia to live safely at home.



Residential care homes offer help with personal care, such as washing, dressing, and
getting to the toilet.



Nursing homes have a trained nurse on duty at all times, and offer more intensive
nursing care, which may be needed if a person is very confused or is incontinent.




These can be difficult decisions to make and you may need a lot of help to decide
what's best. It's wise to think about these things sooner rather than later, so that
you'll have plenty of time to look around and make the right choice.

There are organisations and charities that provide advice and support for people with
dementia and their carers. In the UK, for example, you can contact the Alzheimer's
Society (alzheimers.org.uk) and Alzheimer Scotland (alzscot.org).

Your doctor might be able to help you find support in your area, or you can search
online."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/3000181/Cannula%20insertion,Cannula insertion,"Cannula insertion Last published: Mar 14, 2022
People who need hospital treatment, even just for a short stay, sometimes need to
be given fluids and medicines directly into a vein. This is done using a thin tube
called a cannula.

Having a cannula fitted is usually a quick and relatively painless procedure. Here
we explain what happens and how it can help you.

What is a cannula?
A cannula is a thin, flexible tube that delivers fluids and medicines directly into
a vein. It’s usually placed in a vein on the back of your hand. The veins here are
very near to the surface, so the needle doesn’t have far to go.

It’s put in place using a needle, which fits inside the cannula. When the cannula
is in place, the needle is removed so that the fluids can flow through the cannula.


When a bag of fluid or medication is attached to the cannula, you might hear this
treatment called an intravenous or IV drip.

Why might I need a cannula?
A cannula can deliver fluids, medicines, and blood, as needed, steadily and directly
into your bloodstream, for as long as needed.

It’s useful in a number of situations, including when someone:


is dehydrated but can’t drink anything. This could be for many reasons, such as not
being conscious, having an injury that makes moving difficult, feeling too ill or
frail to drink or swallow, or having a bowel obstruction





needs to be given medicine in a slow, regular way, over several hours or days. For
example, cannulas are often used to deliver a steady flow or “drip” of antibiotics
when someone has a serious infection.



What will happen?
The first thing the doctor or nurse will do is to put a strap, or tourniquet, around
your upper arm - a bit like when you have a blood test. He or she will then tighten
the tourniquet slightly, so that your veins fill up with blood and are easier to see.


The doctor or nurse will then:


find the vein that is to be used, and clean the area around it with an antiseptic
wipe





gently insert the cannula into the vein. This is done using the needle that runs through
the middle of the cannula





slowly withdraw the needle when the cannula is in place




gently feed the cannula into the vein, until the base of the cannula sits snugly on
the skin and the cannula can’t fall out





remove the tourniquet from your upper arm




attach a special connector to the free end of the cannula (the base). Fluid and medicine
bags can now be attached to the cannula





secure the cannula in place with a special plaster called a cannula dressing.


The doctor or nurse might need to try a different vein if it's not possible to insert
the cannula the first time.

What are the risks?
Inserting a cannula is one of the most common hospital procedures. It’s usually quick
and problem free. But complications can happen. For example:



there can be bruising where the cannula is inserted




the place where the cannula is inserted can become infected. In some people this can
become serious and will need treatment with antibiotics





despite the secure dressing, cannulas do sometimes fall out. If this happens, a new
one will probably have to be put in





in some people the cannula can irritate the vein and needs to be removed




cannulas can sometimes become blocked. This can often be flushed out. But sometimes
they need to be replaced





a cannula can cause damage to blood vessels near to the vein where it was inserted.
This can be painful. The cannula will need to be removed, and the doctor will assess
what damage has been done before deciding whether to insert another





cannulas can cause nerve damage. This is rare but it can cause numbness or tingling.




What can I expect afterwards?
A cannula can stay in place for several days if needed. But you might only need it
for a few hours. Once you don’t need it anymore, it is easily removed."

Minor burns can be very sore. They happen when you burn the top layers of your skin.
Minor burns usually heal well and don’t leave a scar.

You can use our information to talk to your doctor or pharmacist and decide which
treatments are right for you.

What are minor burns?
Minor burns damage only the upper layers of skin. The deeper layers are undamaged.
Minor burns are divided into:



superficial burns (such as severe sunburns). These affect only the very top layer
of skin, called the epidermis. You may hear these called first-degree burns.



partial thickness burns. These extend into the second layer of skin, called the dermis.
A burn into the dermis is more serious and will cause blisters. These are called second-degree
burns.



It's very common for children to have accidents that lead to burns. Many children
get injured at home by boiling water from pans or kettles, very hot drinks, such as
freshly brewed tea or coffee, or hot surfaces such as irons or oven doors.

It's important to keep an eye on young children in the kitchen, especially when you're
cooking or making hot drinks.

Older adults are often burned by hot water or by cooking accidents.
What are the symptoms?
Minor burns are bright pink or red, and may blister. They feel very sore. If you touch
the pink or red area, your skin may go white under your finger.

Even a light touch can hurt when you’ve burned your skin. The affected part may start
to swell up.

If the burn reaches the second layer of skin (a second-degree or partial thickness
burn), you will get blisters within a few hours. Blisters are pockets of skin filled
with a clear fluid.

What should you do?
If your burn is very small, you may be able to treat it at home. Otherwise, you should
see a doctor.

Always seek immediate medical attention if you or your child has:


a deep or large burn, or


a burn on the face/head, hands, feet, or genital area.


It’s not always easy to spot a deep burn, because they don’t hurt. That’s because
the nerves that carry pain are damaged.

A deep burn is more likely if you’ve been burned by something very hot: for example,
if you've pressed a hand against an iron or immersed part of your body in boiling
water. Deep burns are often white and the skin looks waxy.

We’ve included some first aid tips that may help limit the damage from a minor burn.
First aid for minor burns
Here are some dos and don'ts to help limit the damage after a burn.


Cool the burn immediately by putting it under a running tap for up to 20 minutes.




You can also immerse it in a bowl of water, or use a spray or a sponge.


Wet towels don't work as well, because they warm up when next to the skin.


The water you use should be tepid, not too cold.


Do not use ice. Ice could cause more damage to the skin.


If you have burned your arm or leg, keeping it raised will help prevent swelling.




Take off any jewellery or watches near the burned area. It could get too tight if
the area swells up.



Take off any clothing on the burned area after you have cooled it down. But don't
pull off clothing that is stuck to the skin.



If you need to see a doctor, cover the burn before you go. Cling film can keep the
wound clean until you get to the doctor. But don't wrap it around your arm or leg.
It will get too tight if the area swells up.



Put one layer of cling film on the wound.


You can keep the cling film in place with tape, but don't get tape on the wound.


Don't cover your burn with anything sticky (such as sticking plaster) or fluffy (such
as cotton wool).



Don't put grease like fat, lard, or butter on your burn.


Don't put any cream or ointment on the burn.


Minor burns can be very sore. Simple painkillers like paracetamol or ibuprofen can
help ease the pain.

Don't burst any blisters at home. Sometimes doctors open up large burn blisters with
sterile scissors, to help them heal. But if you try to do this yourself, you could
infect the burn and cause more damage.

Treatments
There are a few main steps to treating a minor burn. If the burn is very small, you
may be able to do these things at home. Otherwise, you should see a doctor.



The burn will need to be cleaned carefully with water and a mild soap.


To help prevent infection, the burn should be covered in an ointment that kills bacteria
(an antibacterial ointment).



The burn should be covered with a sterile dressing to keep it clean. There are different
types of dressing used for minor burns. One of the most common is a simple gauze dressing.




You may also need to have a tetanus injection, if your vaccinations are not up to
date.

As your burn heals, you will need to regularly clean the wound with mild soap and
water and reapply the dressing. Your doctor can advise you on how often you should
do this. Often, doctors recommend doing this once a day for minor burns.

What will happen to me?
Most minor burns and scalds heal within a couple of weeks. They usually don't leave
a scar, even if the skin has blistered.

Burns that blister the skin sometimes get infected. A burn may be infected if:


it seems to be getting worse (for example, you notice new redness, swelling, or tenderness)


you feel sick or feverish


the burn starts to leak pus, or


you notice an odour.


If any of these things happen, or if you have any other questions or concerns, you
should see your doctor."

Bulimia is a serious medical condition that can damage your health. Many people find
it difficult to talk about this illness, which can make it hard to get help.

But getting help is the most important thing you can do. Treatment can help you feel
better about yourself and stop bulimia taking over your life.

You can use our information to talk with your doctor and decide which treatments are
right for you.

What treatments work?
There are several good treatments for bulimia. They can help you feel better and eat
normally again even if you've had bulimia for a long time.

We talk about two kinds of treatment here: medicines and talking treatments (psychotherapy).
Talking treatments are usually considered the best treatment for bulimia. But doctors
sometimes suggest that people have medicines and therapy together.

Talking treatments
Several types of talking treatment are used to help people with bulimia, but the one
used most often is cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT).

The aim of CBT is to help you stop thinking and acting in harmful ways. Sessions with
a therapist can help you to learn how to cope with unhelpful thoughts. This should
help you stop needing to binge and purge.

You'll probably start with about 20 sessions. Each lasts about an hour. You'll also
be given homework to do between sessions. For example, you might be asked to keep
a diary of what you eat and how often you binge or purge.

You might also be asked to make changes in your life. For example, your therapist
may ask you to eat a small breakfast every day.

You may find some of these exercises stressful but if you stick to them there is a
good chance that they will help. If you're worried about putting on weight it may
help to know that most people don't put on weight during CBT.

Treatment doesn't end when you stop going to a therapist. You'll be able to keep using
the techniques you've learned, to help you stay well in the future.

There's often a waiting list to see a therapist. So your doctor may suggest a kind
of self-help CBT. This may mean reading a book, listening to CDs, or watching videos about bulimia.

You'll have exercises or worksheets to do afterwards. Seeing your doctor or a therapist
every so often can help keep you motivated.

Medicines
Doctors sometimes prescribe medicines called antidepressants for bulimia. These drugs
are usually used to treat depression. But they can help some people with bulimia to
stop bingeing and purging as much, and sometimes completely.

You probably won't be recommended antidepressants for bulimia if you're under 18.
Antidepressants can take several weeks to start working. And they can cause side effects
in some people. Your doctor will keep a regular check on you if you're taking them.

Milder side effects of antidepressants can include drowsiness, diarrhoea, a dry mouth,
feeling sick, and not enjoying sex as much.

Sometimes antidepressants can slightly increase the risk of someone killing themselves.
This risk seems to be greatest in teenagers and young adults. Doctors should carefully
monitor young people who are prescribed antidepressants.

If you find yourself thinking about harming or killing yourself, talk to your doctor
or another healthcare professional straight away.

Talk to your doctor if you get any side effects from antidepressants. Your doctor
may be able to suggest a different antidepressant.

But don’t just stop taking your tablets without talking with your doctor first. Some
antidepressants can cause unpleasant withdrawal symptoms if you stop taking them suddenly.

Support and counselling with nutrition
As well as talking treatments and possibly medicine, you should be offered help and
counselling about how to get the nutrition you need to keep you healthy.

This is usually done by a dietician. You can talk with them about the kinds of things
you eat and the kinds of things you should be eating, and together you can make a
plan that suits your nutrition needs.

Bulimia and diabetes
Bulimia can be especially serious if you have diabetes, as the bingeing and purging
can cause your blood sugar to go up and down very quickly. This can worsen the damage
that diabetes causes to your blood vessels.

People with diabetes who have bulimia may need to be treated urgently in hospital.
Bulimia and pregnancy
Bulimia can be dangerous for unborn babies, because if the mother doesn't get enough
nutrition then neither does the baby.

Doctors don't usually give antidepressants to pregnant women who have bulimia, as
it's best to avoid exposing unborn babies to too many medicines. Instead doctors recommend
talking treatments such as CBT.

If you have bulimia while pregnant your doctor should also make sure that you see
a nutritionist who will give you support and advise you about the right kinds of foods
you'll need to eat so that your baby can grow normally.

You will also have extra scans to check that your baby is healthy."

Bulimia is a serious medical condition that can damage your health. Many people find
it difficult to talk about this illness, which can make it hard to get help.

But getting help is the most important thing you can do. Treatment can help you feel
better about yourself and stop bulimia taking over your life.

What is bulimia?
Many of us worry about our weight and try to control what we eat. But if you have
bulimia it means you're so worried about your weight that you think about it constantly.

This affects your attitude to food. People with bulimia sometimes eat huge amounts.
They then take extreme steps to avoid putting on weight.

The most common thing people do is make themselves vomit after they eat. This is called
purging.

Bulimia has a lot to do with your feelings about yourself and your life. Purging yourself
of food to control your weight might make you feel that you are in control of other
things in your life.

People with bulimia often keep their illness secret. But it may help to know that
you're not alone. Bulimia is common. About 3 in 100 women have it at some point in
their lives. And men can get it, too.

Conditions that affect how you eat are called eating disorders. Another eating disorder
you may have heard of is called anorexia (its full name is anorexia nervosa). People
with anorexia eat so little that it puts their health in danger.

What are the symptoms?
The two main symptoms of bulimia are bingeing and purging.
Bingeing means eating a lot of food at once, usually in secret. If you have bulimia you may
spend your whole day deciding what to eat, where to get it, and how to eat it without
being found out.

The urge to binge may come on after an argument, a bad day, or just because you're
hungry at the end of a day.

Some people say they feel as if they lose control during a binge. Others feel excited
or rebellious while they're planning what they're going to eat. Then afterwards they
may feel guilty.

Purging is how people try to avoid putting on weight after a binge.

Most people who have bulimia purge by making themselves vomit. Others take laxatives
to make them go to the toilet.

Some people try other ways to stop putting on weight, like exercising too much or
going on very strict diets.

In the short term, purging may give you a feeling of control over your body. But in
time, bingeing and purging can become a big part of your life and can damage your
health. These are some of the problems it can cause:



The acid in vomit can damage your teeth


A lack of nutrition can cause muscle cramps and weak vision


The stress that purging puts on your body and the loss of fluids can cause heart palpitations


Repeated purging can rupture your oesophagus (food pipe)


Repeated purging can damage your stomach and cause heartburn or bleeding. Some people
vomit blood.



Losing water through vomiting can increase your chances of kidney stones


Vomiting or using laxatives a lot can change the balance of chemicals in your body,
which can damage your heart.



Getting treatment for bulimia can help prevent these problems.
Worried that someone you know may have bulimia?
It can be hard to tell whether someone close to you has bulimia. People usually keep
it a secret, and they tend to be of normal weight. But there are some signs you can
watch out for.



People with bulimia may talk about weight and body shape a lot more than is normal.


They may insist that they're overweight, even if they're obviously not.


They may talk often about how they'd feel much happier if they could lose weight.


Women with bulimia usually focus on being slim. Men are more likely to talk about
wanting to be muscular or athletic.



Someone with bulimia may go to the toilet more than most people, or they might go
straight after meals, to make themselves vomit.

But not everyone with bulimia makes themselves vomit. Some people go for long periods
without eating, or they exercise more than is healthy.



If you live with someone who has bulimia, there may be times when you notice large
amounts of food going missing. This could be something like a whole packet of biscuits.

If you're a parent, bear in mind that many children and teenagers are picky eaters
at times. This isn't necessarily a sign of an eating disorder.

But if you're worried that your child might have a problem with food, remember that
they can’t help their behaviour. Your child may be scared or embarrassed and will
need your support.

Talking to a friend or family member about a possible eating disorder can be hard.
They may not want to admit that they have a problem, or they may say that they don't
want help. You may end up feeling as if you don't know what to do.

The most important thing is to encourage them to see a doctor. You could offer to
go with them if they feel that would help.

But even if your friend or relative isn’t ready to see a doctor you can still be there
for them and keep offering your support.

What will happen to me?
With treatment, between half and three-quarters of people who have bulimia recover
completely. And many others improve greatly.

The sad thing is that many people with bulimia don't seek treatment at all.
If you seek help, no one will expect you to change overnight. Changing behaviour and
negative thoughts takes time. The most important step is talking to someone and getting
the help and support you need.

Where to get more help or support
Bulimia is a serious condition, and you may find that getting help and support makes
your life easier in many ways. Talking to a friend or family member is a good place
to start.

There may also be charities and support groups where you live that can help, or online
support groups.

For example, in the UK, a charity called Beat provides advice and support for people
with all kinds of eating disorders, including bulimia. You can find out more on their
website (b-eat.co.uk).

You can ask your doctor about support groups in your area."

Will I get fat if I get treatment?


I feel bad about myself. Am I depressed?"
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/3000200/Bronchoscopy,Bronchoscopy,"Bronchoscopy Last published: Jun 23, 2020
A bronchoscopy is a common procedure that lets your doctor look inside your lungs.
Here, we look at how and why it’s done, the risks involved, and what to expect afterwards.

You can use our information to talk with your doctor about this procedure.
What is a bronchoscopy?
A bronchoscopy is a test to look for signs of problems inside your airways. The test
can examine your lungs, throat, voice box (larynx), and windpipe (trachea).

During a bronchoscopy, a doctor passes a tube through your nose or mouth and into
your lungs. He or she can then check for signs of:



infections, such as tuberculosis and pneumonia


inflammation (red, swollen patches)


bleeding, and


lung cancer.


If your doctor sees anything unusual during the test, he or she can take samples of
tissue for testing. This is called a biopsy.

The tube used in a bronchoscopy is called a bronchoscope. It can be flexible or rigid.
Most people have a flexible bronchoscopy because it's safer and more comfortable.
This information covers flexible bronchoscopy.

A rigid bronchoscope is a straight, hollow, metal tube that's sometimes used if you're
having treatment. For example, if you have a small object, such as a peanut, stuck
in your airways, a rigid bronchoscope can be used to remove it.

Why might I need a bronchoscopy?
Most people who have a bronchoscopy have already had other tests, such as a chest
x-ray or other type of scan. If these tests find anything that looks unusual, such
as a shadow or a lump in your lungs, a bronchoscopy can be a useful next step.

The main reasons for a bronchoscopy are if you have symptoms that could be caused
by an infection or possibly by lung cancer. For example, your doctor might suggest
a bronchoscopy if:



you’ve been coughing up blood


you have breathing problems that have been going on for a long time, or


you've been exposed to asbestos in the past and have symptoms of asbestos exposure,
such as chest pain, trouble breathing, or unexplained symptoms.



Your doctor might also suggest this test if you have had any of the following symptoms
that either can’t be explained or has lasted more than three weeks:



chest or shoulder pain


trouble breathing, a hoarse voice, or abnormal breath sounds


a cough


weight loss


a change in shape of the ends of your fingers (called clubbing)


swelling in the glands in your neck or above the collar bone.


Doctors also sometimes suggest a bronchoscopy for people with asthma whose symptoms
are not improving with medication.

What will happen?
Before the test
You have a bronchoscopy in hospital, but you can usually go home the same day. It's
not an operation and you won't have a scar or stitches afterwards.

You won’t be able to eat or drink anything for a few hours before the procedure. Your
hospital will tell you exactly how long before the procedure you should stop.

You might be given medicine to reduce the amount of saliva you produce. This will
make your throat feel dry. But it can make the test easier and quicker.

If you have asthma, you might be given medicine to open up your airways. This will
help you breathe during the test.

You might be given a drug called a sedative to relax you, especially if you feel anxious.
This is usually given by an injection in the back of your hand.You'll feel a bit sleepy
after the sedative, but it's not a general anaesthetic so you'll still be aware of
what's going on around you.

You'll also be given a local anaesthetic to numb the back of your nose and throat.
This may be sprayed into the back of your throat, or you might be given a lozenge
to suck, or a mask to breathe through.

The anaesthetic might taste unpleasant, but it should stop you gagging during the
test.

During the bronchoscopy
During the procedure:


you lie flat on your back with a pillow under your head, or sit or lean back in a
chair



your doctor puts a long, flexible tube (the bronchoscope) through your nose, into
your windpipe and down to your lungs. If the passages in your nose are too narrow
for the tube, the test might be done through your mouth instead.

The tube has a light and a camera on the end. The camera sends pictures of your airways
back up the bronchoscope to a screen. The doctor watches the screen or looks through
an eyepiece at the top of the bronchoscope while gently feeding it into your lungs



your doctor checks your lungs for sore patches, damage, inflammation (swelling), and
lumps. The doctor will look at both sides of your lungs, and go down the airways as
far as possible



you shouldn’t try to talk during the procedure. The doctor or nurse will show you
how to signal if you are in any pain



you should be able to breathe normally during a bronchoscopy. The doctor will check
that you're getting enough oxygen using a small device attached to one of your fingers.
This measures the oxygen in your blood..

If it falls too low, you'll be given extra oxygen to breathe. This goes through a
soft tube in the nostril that isn't being used for the bronchoscope.



If your doctor thinks that there might be cancer cells in your lungs, he or she might
inject some fluid into your lungs that helps to show up the cells.

This is called fluoroscopy. It helps doctors see the narrow parts of your lungs that
the bronchoscope can't reach. Your doctor might also use a very thin bronchoscope,
which is threaded through the thicker one, to reach these smaller airways.

Bronchoscopy is a useful test, but it can miss some small cancers. This is usually
because the tumour is very deep inside the lungs and the bronchoscope is too big to
get inside the small airways.

So your doctor might also use the bronchoscope to take samples of tissue from your
airways to check later under a microscope. This increases the chance of the test finding
any cancer cells that might be in your lungs.

Having a bronchoscopy can be uncomfortable.You might feel the tube moving around inside
your chest, and you might gag and cough. Taking deep, regular breaths can stop you
coughing. If this doesn't help, you might be given some medicine.

What are the risks?
Like any procedure, bronchoscopy can cause problems. These are usually minor, and
they get better quickly. Serious problems are rare. Your doctor should discuss the
risks of the procedure before you have it.

Complications of bronchoscopy include:


having a sore throat of losing your voice for a short time


feeling nauseous or vomiting. This is probably caused by the anaesthetic


a drop in your blood pressure for a short time. Again, this is probably caused by
the anaesthetic



a raised temperature (fever). This is fairly common after bronchoscopy, but it’s rarely
serious. Some people need to have antibiotics, but this is usually because they already
had an infection



an irregular heartbeat. This happens if your blood oxygen falls too low, but it’s
rarely serious. Your blood oxygen will be monitored so you can be given extra oxygen
if you need it



bleeding in the lungs. This can happen when tissue is taken for testing. It’s rarely
serious and and can usually be stopped easily



trapped air, called a pneumothorax. This is when air gets trapped in the space between
your lungs and your chest wall. It’s more likely to happen if you have tissue samples
taken from your lungs. It is treated by putting a needle or tube into your chest to
let the air out. Rarely, it can happen after you leave hospital. If you have continuous,
sharp chest pain and difficulty breathing, you might need to return to hospital for
treatment



it’s extremely rare, but some people die soon after a bronchoscopy. This is usually
because they were very ill to begin with.



What can I expect afterwards?
Most people can go home about two hours after the test. But you should wait until
you feel comfortable and can swallow normally.

You might have an x-ray an hour or so after your bronchoscopy to make sure air isn't
trapped in the space between your lungs and your chest wall (pneumothorax). If you
have trapped air, you might need treatment to release it.

If you smoke and you have had some tissue samples taken from your airways, you shouldn't
smoke for a while afterwards. And you should try not to cough or clear your throat.
This will help the area heal more quickly. Or course, it’s best to stop smoking completely
if you can.

If you had a sedative, you might feel drowsy and you might not remember much about
the test. You won't be able to drive for about 24 hours. Make sure someone is with
you when you travel home.

The doctor might tell you what the bronchoscopy showed before you go home. But if
they took any samples of tissue or cells, you won’t get these results right away.


You should contact the hospital right away if you have any of these symptoms:


fever


sharp chest pain


difficulty breathing


coughing up a lot of blood (it’s normal to cough up a little)."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1569725406627/Bronchitis,Bronchitis,"Bronchitis Last published: Aug 30, 2022
Bronchitis is a chest infection that causes a bad cough. It usually gets better on
its own in a few weeks, but you might need to see your doctor.

What is bronchitis?
If you have bronchitis the lining of the airways in your lungs gets inflamed (swollen).
This causes a cough that can become painful as it strains the muscles in your chest.

Almost all cases of bronchitis are caused by infection with a virus and get better
after about three or four weeks.

Bronchitis often starts as you're getting over another illness affecting the airways,
such as a cold or flu. As your body fights off the virus, the lining of the airways
in your lungs gets inflamed and coated with mucus.

Children under age 4 and older people are most likely to get bronchitis, especially
if they already have other health problems that affect their lungs and heart.

What are the symptoms?
The main symptom of bronchitis is a bad cough. You might also:


feel generally unwell and tired


have a slight fever


have aching muscles


wheeze (make a whistling sound when you breathe) and feel short of breath


cough up mucus.


You should go to the doctor if you are worried about your symptoms or if you have
other health problems, such as lung problems or heart disease. Young children with
bronchitis should also see a doctor.

Some symptoms might mean you have a more serious condition. You should see your doctor
if you:



have a high temperature (more than 38°C)


feel very out of breath


get bad chest pains


cough up a lot of green or yellow sputum, or any blood.


Your doctor might send you for a chest x-ray to see if you have pneumonia. Pneumonia
happens when germs infect the lungs, making it difficult to breathe. If this happens
you will need extra treatment, and possibly antibiotics.

What treatments work?
Bronchitis usually clears up on its own. You might find that painkillers, such as
paracetamol, ease your symptoms. Remember to drink plenty of fluids. Hot drinks can
be comforting.

Medicines
Medicines called cough suppressants are meant to stop you coughing. Some people with
a cough find them useful to get a good night's sleep.

Cough medicines called expectorants are meant to help you cough up mucus. You can
buy different kinds from a pharmacy. But research suggests that they don't help with
bronchitis.

If you are wheezing a lot your doctor might recommend an inhaler like those used for
people with asthma. This might reduce cough and wheezing while you are getting better.
But it will not clear up the bronchitis any faster.

Antibiotics might clear up your cough about half a day sooner if your bronchitis is
caused by a bacteria. But most cases of bronchitis are caused by a virus. Antibiotics
don't work on viruses.

Doctors don’t usually prescribe antibiotics for bronchitis because they only work
on bronchitis caused by bacteria, they don't make much difference, and they can cause
side effects.

What will happen to me?
Your cough should clear up in about 7 to 10 days, but it could last longer. Many people
cough for three weeks or more. If you have a very bad cough with other symptoms, such
as a high fever, you should see your doctor.

Some other conditions can be made worse by bronchitis. For example, if you have asthma,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or heart disease, bronchitis might make
this worse. You should see your doctor if this happens. Your doctor might need to
adjust your usual treatment to help. Smoking makes bronchitis worse, and you should
try to stop."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1503784463689/Bronchiolitis,Bronchiolitis,"Bronchiolitis Last published: Dec 06, 2021
Bronchiolitis is a common infection affecting the lungs of babies and very young children.
It can make them wheezy and affect their breathing. It isn't usually serious and most
children recover at home. But some children need hospital care.

You can use our information to talk with your doctor and decide which treatments are
best for your child.

What is bronchiolitis?
Bronchiolitis is an illness caused by an infection in the small tubes inside a child's
lungs. These tubes are called bronchioles.

When a child has bronchiolitis the walls of these tubes become swollen and the tubes
fill with mucus. This makes it harder for the child to breathe. Bronchiolitis is usually
caused by a virus called the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).

Bronchiolitis mainly affects children under 2 years old. Around 1 in every 30 babies
are diagnosed with the illness before their first birthday.

Like colds and flu, bronchiolitis follows a seasonal pattern, with most infections
happening in the late autumn, winter, and early spring.

What are the symptoms?
The symptoms of bronchiolitis aren't severe for most children. Your child might have
a heavy cold, runny nose, wheezing, and a cough. They might also have a mild fever.

But some children have more serious problems with their breathing. Your child should
see a doctor or be taken to hospital straight away if they:



have bluish lips or skin


breathe fast or have flaring nostrils


have bad wheezing or a crackly-sounding chest


need to make a big effort to breathe, or stop breathing for a few seconds


struggle to feed or drink.


What treatments work?
Treatments for bronchiolitis
Most children with bronchiolitis can be looked after at home. If your child is usually
healthy your doctor might just suggest you give them plenty of fluids and let them
rest.

If your child is in pain or has a fever you can give them paracetamol syrup (for example, Calpol).

Doctors sometimes prescribe a medicine called a corticosteroid (for example, prednisolone) to children with bronchiolitis. But it's not clear from
research whether these medicines make a difference, and they are currently not recommended.
The same is true for medicines called bronchodilators.

They are most likely to be helpful if a child is over 1 year old and has had wheezing
before or has an increased chance of having asthma (for example, if one of the child's
parents has asthma).

You should take your child back to the doctor if he or she can't drink enough or they
start to have a harder time breathing.

If your child has difficulty breathing, they might need oxygen treatment in hospital. This involves giving them extra oxygen through a tube that's put in
their nose, or through a type of hood that goes over their head.

If your child still can't get enough oxygen he or she might need to be put on a ventilating
machine that breathes for them. But most children don't need a ventilating machine.

If your child can't drink enough he or she might need to be given fluids through a drip (also called an intravenous infusion or IV). Your child might also be given food through a tube passed through the mouth and into the stomach.

Children who are very ill with bronchiolitis are sometimes treated with an antiviral
medicine (a type of drug that fights viruses).

This type of medicine is also given to some children who have a high chance of becoming
very ill from bronchiolitis: for example, if they have another illness that affects
their breathing or a weak immune system.

But there's not much good research about whether antivirals can help, and they can
have side effects.

Treatments to prevent bronchiolitis
Babies who were born early (prematurely) or with heart problems, or who have a lung
condition or a very weak immune system are sometimes given a medicine called palivizumab to help prevent bronchiolitis during the months of the year when it is most common.

Palivizumab is a medicine that helps the body fight off the virus that usually causes
bronchiolitis. During peak bronchiolitis season these children might have the medicine
once a month, for up to five months.

What will happen to my child?
Most young children with bronchiolitis get better at home, usually within a few days.
But even if your child needs hospital treatment they'll usually only need to stay
in hospital until doctors can make sure their breathing is OK and they can eat and
drink enough.

Children who have had bronchiolitis - particularly if they had to be treated in hospital
- are more likely than other children to have episodes of wheezing later on. However,

Bronchiectasis is a lung disease that causes breathing problems and makes chest infections
more likely.

You can use our information to talk with your doctor and decide which treatments are
right for you. To learn more about what happens in bronchiectasis and its symptoms,
see the leaflet Bronchiectasis: what is it?

How treatment can help
Bonchiectasis can't be cured, but there are treatments that can help you live with
the symptoms. The aims of treatment are to:



ease the main symptoms of bronchiectasis, such as coughing, mucus production, and
breathing difficulties



improve your quality of life


reduce the number of exacerbations you have, and


prevent more damage to your airways.


Exercises and physiotherapy
Exercises to strengthen your chest muscles can make it easier to breathe more freely and to
live a more normal life. To train your chest muscles, you breathe in through a device
that makes your muscles work harder.

You'll be shown how to use the device by a doctor, nurse, or other health professional.
You'll probably have to do these exercises for 30 minutes a day, five days a week.

Many doctors recommend a type of physiotherapy that aims to clear mucus out of the lungs. Some people find it helpful to blow into
a small device that helps them to loosen the mucus.

You might be asked to move into different positions, so that gravity helps the mucus
to drain out of the lungs. A physiotherapist might tap your chest to loosen the mucus
and help it start to move.

Medicines to help your breathing
Your doctor may also try some medicines to help you breathe more easily. The medicines
might include:



A bronchodilator (a drug to open up the airways). Bronchodilators are usually given by inhaler.

These medicines can cause side effects, but they are not usually troublesome in the
long term. For example, they make your hands tremble, especially when you first use
them. They may also make you feel like your heart is beating faster. But this should
go away if you reduce the dose.



A mucolytic (a drug to break up mucus). These come as a drug that you breathe in through a mask.
They are not recommended for people who don't have cystic fibrosis.

These can cause flu-like symptoms in some people.


Salt water (called hypertonic saline). This aims to make your mucus thinner. You breathe it
in through a mask using a machine called a nebuliser.



Surgery
If parts of your lungs are very badly damaged your doctor may advise you to have an
operation to remove the worst parts. But surgery for bronchiectasis is rare. Your
doctor is more likely to suggest this if you often cough up a lot of blood and find
it very hard to breathe properly.

In the most serious cases, doctors might recommend a lung transplant. But this is
very rare.

Other treatments you may need
If you get a chest infection you'll need a course of antibiotics to kill the bacteria that are probably causing it. The sooner you start the antibiotics
the better. So it's important to go to your doctor as soon as you notice:



Any worsening of symptoms


A change in the colour of the mucus being coughed up.


Your doctor may give you antibiotics to keep at home, so you can start taking them
as soon as you feel an infection starting. But you should still go to the doctor to
get the mucus tested, to check what bacteria you have. You might need a different
antibiotic.

Because infections can lead to serious problems if you have bronchiectasis, you should
make sure you get a flu vaccine every year.

Some people may get infections so often that they need to take antibiotics all the
time. As well as preventing infections, this can give your lungs a chance to recover.
Long-term antibiotics can be taken as tablets or with a nebuliser.

Using antibiotics in this way can sometimes lead to bacteria becoming resistant. If
this happens the antibiotics don't work any more. So you might need to have your mucus
checked regularly. If the bacteria become resistant you will need to change to a different
antibiotic."

Bronchiectasis is a lung disease that causes breathing problems and makes chest infections
more likely. There is no cure for bronchiectasis, but treatments can help you cope
with the symptoms.

What is bronchiectasis?
If you have bronchiectasis, some of the airways in your lungs are too wide. This usually happens because the walls of the airways have been damaged. When the
airways are too wide, mucus builds up inside them.

When you have a lot of mucus in your lungs you may find it hard to cough it all out.
The mucus that gets left behind can be infected by bacteria. This can cause a chest
infection.

Most people who have bronchiectasis have a condition called cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis is an inherited condition. People with this condition are usually
diagnosed when they are babies or young children.

Some people with bronchiectasis have other inherited conditions such as alpha-1 antitrypsin
deficiency, a condition that can cause problems with the lungs and liver.

Adults who get bronchiectasis might get it after an infection, such as measles or
tuberculosis (TB), or after breathing in a harmful chemical.

What are the symptoms?
The main symptom of bronchiectasis is coughing up a lot of mucus (also called sputum).
You might cough up as much as half a litre (one pint) of mucus in a day. You might
also:



feel breathless


wheeze


get very tired, and


cough up blood.


These symptoms can be alarming and can make you feel unwell. If you have a child with
bronchiectasis it can be especially distressing to watch this happening to them.

If you or your child has symptoms that seem worse than usual you should talk to your
doctor straight away.

What will happen?
It's hard to say what will happen to you as an individual. Bronchiectasis doesn't
go away, and some people get more symptoms than others.

Treatments can help you cope with the symptoms and improve how well your lungs work.
To learn more, see the leaflet Bronchiectasis: what treatments work?

If you get a chest infection it may make your symptoms worse for a few days or weeks.
This is sometimes called an exacerbation.

Most people get exacerbations once or twice a year. But if you have severe bronchiectasis
you could have six or more exacerbations a year.

If you get your infections treated quickly, and you can cough up mucus, you will probably
be able to live with your condition quite normally.

Some people get very bad bronchiectasis. This can sometimes be life threatening for
older people. This is because having difficulty breathing can put a strain on the
rest of your body, including your heart.

Where to get more help
It can be hard to live with a lung disease like bronchiectasis. If you'd like to be
put in touch with other people who have the disease, or other parents whose children
have it, there might be charities or support groups near you that can help.

For example, in the UK, Breathe Easy might be able to help. It is part of the British
Lung Foundation (blf.org.uk). Or you could try the Cystic Fibrosis Trust (cysticfibrosis.org.uk)."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/3000155/Brief%20psychotic%20disorder,Brief psychotic disorder,"Brief psychotic disorder Last published: Apr 30, 2020
Psychosis is not usually a condition in itself, but a symptom or side effect of something
else.

But some people have spells of psychosis that are not caused by other medical conditions,
or by other common causes of psychosis.

This is called brief psychotic disorder. It can be very distressing. But there are
treatments that can help you get through it.

What is psychosis?
Doctors usually talk about psychosis as being a symptom, rather than a medical problem
in itself.

But psychosis is actually a group of symptoms. Someone with psychosis can have one,
several, or all of them. They are:



having delusions - believing things that aren’t true


having hallucinations - seeing, hearing, and thinking you can touch things that aren’t
real



speaking or behaving in a very confused and random way, and


“catatonic” behaviour - hardly speaking, moving, or reacting at all to the world around
you.



Psychosis is often caused by a mental-health condition. For example, it’s a common
symptom of schizophrenia. And it can sometimes be a symptom of other mental-health
problems, including depression and anxiety.

Psychosis can also be caused by many other things, including:


some medicines and recreational drugs




injuries to the front of the brain




exposure to toxic substances such as some fertilisers and weed killers, and




some physical illnesses.


For more information on what can cause psychosis, see our leaflet: Psychosis.
What is brief psychotic disorder?
If you have brief psychotic disorder, or BPD for short, you have psychosis that comes on suddenly and lasts for between one day
and one month. The symptoms then stop, and usually they don’t come back.

There are three types of BPD:


BPD that’s caused by an extremely stressful event. For example, some military personnel
have BPD after a traumatic event. But this could be anything, including the death
of someone close, the end of a relationship, or being in an accident.





BPD that has no known cause, and




BPD that happens to a woman shortly after she gives birth. This is called postnatal
or postpartum psychosis. It happens to 1 or 2 in every 1000 women within four weeks
of having a baby.



There is still a lot that we don’t know about BPD. But we do know that it is more
common in:



people in developing countries


people with a personality disorder. (For more information, see our leaflet: Personality disorders: what are they?)


women who are exposed to stress while pregnant (and women who have BPD after giving
birth)



people with a history of mental-health symptoms, and


people with family members who have had BPD.


What are the symptoms?
In order to diagnose BPD in someone, a doctor needs to rule other causes of psychosis.


But it’s actually very hard for doctors to say for certain that someone has BPD. This
is because it’s only really possible to say that someone had BPD after they have recovered.


This doesn’t mean that you won’t get any help: there are good treatments to help relieve
the symptoms of psychosis. And your doctor will understand the type of follow-up help
you need after you recover.

If you see a doctor and you have symptoms of psychosis, the doctor will want to find
out what is causing them. He or she will not be able to tell right away if your psychosis
is caused by BPD.

So your doctor will examine you physically, check through your medical history, and
ask you (and, often, someone who has come with you) questions about what might be
causing your problems.

Your doctor will want to know about things like:


any medical conditions you suffer from, including conditions that might affect your
nervous system





whether you have a history of mental-health problems




what medications you take




whether you have taken any recreational drugs, either recently over the long term




any recent head injuries, and




whether you have had contact with any toxic chemicals.


You might have blood and urine tests, to check for drugs, medicines, and other toxic
substances.

Your doctor’s first concern will be to keep you safe. This might just mean identifying
any toxic substance you have taken, either deliberately or by accident, and getting
a clear picture of your medical history.

But it might also mean that you need to be kept in hospital for a while, even if you
don’t want to. Your doctor can make this decision against your will if he or she thinks
you might be a danger to yourself or others.

This might be for several reasons. For example, you might be:


unable to look after yourself


aggressive


having severe delusions or hallucinations: for example, you might be hearing voices
telling you to do things



behaving very strangely


behaving in a way that suggests that you might try to kill yourself or someone else.


If you are hospitalised in this way for a while, you might need to be given medication
to keep you calm and safe. Again, you might not want this medication. But your doctor
can override your wishes to keep you and others safe until you are feeling better.

What treatments work?
Drug treatments
The first treatment for most people with symptoms of psychosis is medications called
antipsychotics. As the name suggests, these medicines help to ease the symptoms of
psychosis.

If you have BPD, the psychosis symptoms clear up within a few days or weeks. So you
shouldn’t need to take the medications for long. If you need to take them for several
weeks, your doctor might suggest reducing the dose gradually when the time comes to
stop taking them.

Some antipsychotic medicines can cause side effects such as weight gain, high blood
sugar, and high cholesterol.

This could be dangerous if you already have conditions such as diabetes or heart disease.
But it shouldn’t be a problem, as people with BPD usually only need the antipsychotics
for a short time - not long enough for the side effects to become a problem.

Psychotherapy and other support
As well as prescribing medications to help with your symptoms, your doctor might also
arrange for you to get help with your mental health. This might mean talking with
a psychotherapist or psychiatrist. Or it might be enough just to talk with your doctor.


Whoever you talk to, he or she will want to discuss things like:


helping you cope with the stress that led to the BPD




helping you prevent BPD from happening again




what help and support you have from your family, and




whether you need to see a psychologist or psychiatrist regularly for a while.


BPD in new mothers
Being a new mother should be a happy time. But it can also be hugely stressful, tiring,
and worrying.

Many new mothers struggle with the physical, emotional, and mental changes that happen
after having a baby. For example, most people know about postnatal depression. But
BPD in new mothers is not as widely understood.

Your doctor will know about it, though. And he or she will want to talk about what
support you have at home, and what extra help you need in the future. Specialist mental
health teams are usually involved in the care of mothers who have psychosis after
giving birth.

There are also support groups for new mothers with postpartum psychosis. For example,
in the UK, Action on Postpartum Psychosis (app-network.org) offers help in many ways.

What will happen?
Antipsychotic medicines can work well for BPD. But it’s important to take them as
prescribed, and not to miss doses.

This can be hard when you are struggling with symptoms of psychosis. So it might help
if you have a family member or friend who can help you with taking your medication
on time.

Once your symptoms have stopped, and you don’t need the medicine anymore, your doctor
will probably want to see you at least once a month for a few months to check how
you are doing.

BPD can happen again in some people, but it shouldn’t keep happening. If you do keep
having episodes of psychosis, your doctor will want to look at whether your symptoms
are being caused by something else."

Breast pain can be distressing, but it's not usually a sign that there's something
seriously wrong. Often there's no obvious cause. However, there are treatments that
can help.

We've brought together the best research about breast pain and weighed up the evidence
about how to treat it. You can use our information to talk to your doctor and decide
which treatments are right for you.

What happens?
Breast pain is also called mastalgia. It's very common.

Most breast pain falls into two general categories.


Cyclical breast pain follows a usual pattern, coming on in the week or two before your period. This is
the most common type of breast pain among women who haven't gone through the menopause.



Non-cyclical breast pain isn't linked to your periods. Your breast (or breasts) feels painful some of the
time, or even constantly. Usually, there doesn't seem to be a cause. But sometimes
non-cyclical breast pain is caused by things like an infection or a cyst (a fluid-filled
sac in the breast). If this is the case, your doctor will treat these underlying problems,
which should improve your breast pain.



Many women worry that breast pain means they have breast cancer. But pain on its own
is not a common symptom of breast cancer. However, if you are worried about breast
pain, or you have other symptoms such as a lump or a red or inflamed area on your
breast, see your doctor.

What are the symptoms?
Cyclical breast pain can be dull, heavy, or aching. It starts in the two weeks before your period. The
pain may get worse until your period starts and then get better. You may get pain
in both breasts.

Non-cyclical breast pain can be sharp and burning. It may come and go, or be there all the time. You may get
pain in just one breast.

Both types of breast pain can be distressing, particularly during sex.
See your doctor urgently if you have:


Discharge from your nipples


Signs of infection, like redness, pus, or fever


A new lump in one of your breasts.


What treatments work?
If your breast pain has no obvious cause, and it isn't bothering you too much, you
may not need treatment. But if it is disrupting your life, there are treatments that
might help.

Things you can do for yourself
You may find it helps to have a bra properly fitted, or to try one with more support.
A sports bra for exercise may help.

Some women find that reducing the amount of caffeine or salt in their diet improves
their breast pain. But there isn't enough research to say for certain whether this
helps.

Supplements
There isn't much good research looking at taking supplements to improve breast pain.
But some women say that taking evening primrose oil helps.

Pain medicines
Doctors often recommend taking over-the-counter pain medicines for breast pain. These
include paracetamol and ibuprofen. Many women find this improves their pain.

Hormone treatments
If your breast pain is very bad, disrupts your life, and has lasted more than six
months, your doctor may suggest taking hormone treatments. Medicines your doctor might
recommend include tamoxifen, bromocriptine, and danazol.

These medicines can reduce breast pain. But they can also sometimes cause side effects.
Your doctor will discuss possible problems with you. Danazol isn't used very often
because many women find its side effects difficult to tolerate. These may include
weight gain, a deep voice, heavy periods, and muscle cramps.

What will happen to me?
Breast pain often goes away on its own without any treatment. But it may come back
again. However, many women with breast pain linked to their period find they no longer
have breast pain after the menopause."

If you find a lump in your breast you’ll probably worry that it could be cancer. And,
of course, you should see your doctor to have it checked.

But most breast lumps are what’s called 'benign'. This means that they are not cancer
and are usually not dangerous. In this leaflet, we explain the most common causes
of benign breast lumps.

What are non-cancerous (benign) breast lumps?
A benign breast lump is simply a lump (your doctor may call it a mass) in your breast that isn’t caused by cancer.

About 90 in every 100 women who see their doctor because of a lump in their breast
don’t have cancer.

Doctors have several ways of finding the cause of benign breast lumps. The first thing
they will do is examine you, by looking at your breast and gently feeling the lump.
This can help to tell what kind of lump it is and what has caused it.

There are also tests that can help diagnose the cause of a lump. For example, you probably know about
scans such as mammograms and ultrasound.

You may also have a test called a needle biopsy, where a tiny piece of tissue from the lump is taken for testing under a microscope.

Using scans and a biopsy, doctors can find the cause of almost all breast lumps.
Breast cancer and breast lumps in men
When we talk about breast cancer we almost always talk about women. But, although
it’s rare, men can get breast cancer.

About 1 in every 100 people who get breast cancer are men.
Men can get benign breast lumps, too. But this is also rare. When it does happen,
it’s usually caused by a condition called gynaecomastia. This happens when a man’s breast tissue starts to grow because of hormone problems.

If you are a man and you find a lump in your chest, see your doctor. As with women,
it’s not usually cancer. But you should find out as soon as possible, just in case.

Things that cause benign breast lumps
Many things can cause a lump in your breast that isn’t cancer. Here, we look at the
most common ones.

Fibroadenoma
A fibroadenoma is a tumour that is not cancer. A tumour happens when cells begin to grow and multiply in ways they’re not supposed to. This
causes a lump to form.

With a malignant tumour (cancer), this new growth spreads into other body tissues and organs, causing
serious illness.

But with a benign tumour like a fibroadenoma, the new growth stays where it is and doesn’t spread.
This means that it can’t cause any serious problems.

Fibroadenoma is common. About 10 in every 100 women develop a fibroadenoma at some
point in their lives.

Doctors used to think that women with fibroadenomas were more likely to get breast
cancer. But newer research suggests that this isn’t true.

Phyllodes tumour
Phyllodes tumours are tumours that are usually benign. They can sometimes be malignant
(cancerous), but this is rare.

Even when these tumours are malignant, they rarely spread beyond the breast. But most
women decide to have treatment, just in case.

Phyllodes tumours can be removed with surgery, but this isn’t always needed. Some women can have treatment with radiation instead.

Fibrocystic breast
Breast cysts are fluid-filled lumps in the breast. Some women have several cysts at
a time. This can make your breast feel lumpy, and it can be painful.

For example, you may find that your breast hurts when you move around a lot, or that
you need to wear a more supportive bra.

Fibrocystic breasts are fairly common around the menopause. The discomfort usually goes away by itself, but you can take simple painkillers
in the meantime.

If your symptoms are severe, your doctor can prescribe other treatments.
It’s rare for breast cysts to develop into cancer, but it can happen. And, as with any lumps or changes in your breasts, it’s always
best to see your doctor.

Fat necrosis
Necrosis is what happens when body tissue dies because it doesn’t get enough blood
flow.

Areas of fat necrosis in the breast can be caused by several things, including:


an injury: for example, some women’s breasts are damaged by vehicle seat belts


damage caused during surgery, and


damage caused by radiation treatment.


The affected areas can form lumps in your breast that feel like hard scar tissue.
Fat necrosis is not dangerous and doesn’t cause cancer. But it can feel uncomfortable.

If you have severe pain, talk to your doctor about possible treatments. Women with
large lumps sometimes need to have surgery to remove them. But this is rare.

Breast papilloma
A papilloma is a lump in the breast, usually near the nipple. Women with a breast
papilloma often notice bloody discharge from their nipple.

This type of lump is called a papilloma because it grows in a similar way to a wart
(warts are caused by a virus called the human papillomavirus), even though breast
papillomas aren’t related to warts.

Breast papillomas can sometimes become cancerous over time. So many women have them
removed with surgery. But this is not always needed. You can talk to your doctor about
whether you need treatment.

Breast abscess
Breast abscesses are common in women who are breastfeeding. They are small local infections
caused by blocked or leaking milk ducts in the breast.

They clear up by themselves but they can be uncomfortable. As always, if you are concerned,
tell your doctor.

Adenoma
A breast adenoma is similar to a fibroadenoma in some ways. It often happens to women
who are breastfeeding or who have recently given birth.

What to look out for
As you can see, there is a long list of things that cause lumps in the breasts that
are not cancer. And most breast lumps turn out not to be cancer.

But you should always see your doctor if you notice any changes in your breasts. In
particular, see your doctor straight away if you notice changes in your breasts such
as:



a change in the shape or size of a breast


a lump in a breast


discharge from one or both nipples


a change in the texture or colour of the skin of a breast, or


a rash, or itchy or scaly skin around a nipple."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/3000035/Breast%20cancer%3A%20routine%20screening%20%28mammography%29,Breast cancer: routine screening (mammography),"Breast cancer: routine screening (mammography) Last published: Jan 18, 2023
Breast cancer screening is usually done with a test called a mammogram. A mammogram
is a type of x-ray. This leaflet looks at the recommendations on breast cancer screening
from various guidelines.
What is breast cancer screening?
For women, getting regular mammograms at certain ages helps reduce the chance of dying
from breast cancer. But it has some drawbacks.

Various healthcare organisations produce guidelines for physicians and patients about breast cancer screening. This leaflet looks at
what these guidelines recommend about when to start, when to stop, and how often to
have a mammogram.

This leaflet is for women who have an average risk of getting breast cancer. If you
have a high risk (for example, if you have a family history of breast cancer or have
tested positive for the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene) then you will need to get special advice
from your doctor.

Women at a higher risk may need to make a different plan or have other tests in addition
to mammography, such as an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan.

Who gets breast cancer?
Breast cancer is more likely to affect women as they get older. Things that make you
more likely to get a particular illness are called ‘risk factors’. But, as with any
other illness, having risk factors for breast cancer doesn’t mean you will definitely
get breast cancer. And many people without any risk factors do get breast cancer.
So these risk factors are only a guide.

Risk factors for breast cancer include:


being female


being older


not having ever been pregnant


if you began having menstrual periods at an early age, or if you had the menopause
later in life than is usual



if the time between your first period and the first time you gave birth was a lot
longer than is usual



taking oestrogen plus progesterone (hormone replacement or HRT for short) after the
menopause



a family history of breast or ovarian cancer


having certain genes


having dense breasts


being heavier


smoking


drinking alcohol


having ever had radiotherapy to the chest.


How does routine mammography help?
For women at average risk of getting breast cancer it is estimated that having mammograms
can reduce your chance of dying from breast cancer to about three quarters of the
usual risk in middle age.

It’s not known whether mammograms reduce your chance of needing treatment for later-stage
breast cancers. But the hope is to catch breast cancer early, so that you can avoid
this type of treatment.

Breast examination and self-examination
There’s not enough evidence to say whether having a breast examination along with
your mammogram helps reduce the chance of dying from breast cancer. So different guidelines
recommend different things.

Teaching women to examine their own breasts regularly (breast self-examination or
BSE) regularly is not generally recommended in guidelines for women with an average
chance of breast cancer.

This is because it might show up problems when there is no cancer. Also, research
has not shown for certain that doing regular breast self-examinations helps prevent
dying from breast cancer.

But if you notice a change in your breasts you should see your doctor straight away.
This is called ‘breast self-awareness’. For example, you might notice pain, a lump,
discharge from your nipples, or redness. It’s important to follow up on this immediately.


What are the possible harms of mammography?
Mammograms help to find early breast cancers, but they do have some drawbacks:
False-positive mammogram results
False-positives are when the mammogram finds an abnormality but there is no cancer.


This may mean that you get called back to have more x-rays, other tests such as ultrasound
or MRI, or a biopsy (when a sample of cells or tissue is taken to look at under a
microscope).

Anxiety or distress
Getting called back for further testing might cause you anxiety, even if your follow-up
tests are normal.

Discomfort
You might find a mammogram uncomfortable. In order to do the mammogram your breasts
will need to be pressed between two plates. But this doesn’t stop most women from
having or going back for a mammogram.

You might also have some pain if you need a biopsy.
Over-diagnosis and over-treatment
Some breast cancers found by mammograms would not have caused any problems in the
woman’s lifetime. It’s hard to tell how often these are found by mammograms and then
treated.

For example, mammograms sometimes find something called ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).
This means that there are cancer cells in the lining of the breast ducts. There is
a chance that these cells could develop into breast cancer. So, once it is found,
DCIS is usually treated like breast cancer. This usually includes surgery.

Screening can miss some cancers (false-negatives)
Breast cancer screening isn’t foolproof. Some women get an all-clear result that is
not accurate, because the mammogram has failed to spot a cancer. This happens for
about 1 in 5 breast cancers.

Radiation exposure
It is estimated that mammograms might rarely cause some breast cancers. But screening
finds many more cases of breast cancer than it might cause.


What do the guidelines recommend?
Different guidelines recommend different ages to start or stop having a mammogram.
You should check what’s recommended and available where you live. Here are some examples.


The UK National Health Service (NHS) recommends that you:



start having screening at age 50


have screening and routine breast examinations every 3 years


stop having screening at age 70.


The American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists recommends that you:



discuss screening with your doctor at age 40 and start screening by age 50


have screening every 1 or 2 years


discuss with your doctor whether to continue screening after age 75


have routine breast examinations every 1 to 3 years from age 25 to 39, then every
year after age 40.



The American Cancer Society recommends that you:



discuss screening with your doctor at age 40 and start screening by age 45


have screening every year from age 40 to 54, then every 2 years, with an option for
annual screening if you want it



stop screening when you expect that you will live less than 10 more years


do not have routine breast examinations.


The US Preventive Services Task Force advises that:



you discuss screening with your doctor at age 40 and start screening by age 50


you have screening every 2 years


there isn’t enough evidence to say whether you should carry on having screening after
75



there isn’t enough evidence about whether routine breast examinations are useful.


The US National Comprehensive Cancer network recommends that you:



start having screening at age 40 and have screening every year


stop screening when you expect that you will live less than 10 more years


discuss routine breast examinations with your doctor every 1 to 3 years from age 25
to 39, then every year after age 40.



The Swiss Medical Board recommends that all decisions about screening and routine breast examinations should
be made with each patient based on that person’s individual circumstances and wishes.

What should I do about routine mammograms?
Screening with mammograms for women in the recommended age groups helps save lives.


But it may lead to extra tests and to treatment for some cancers that would not have
caused any problems.

Screening with mammograms more often or at an earlier age (say, 40 instead of 50)
finds more cancers. But this also means more recalls and biopsies for some women when
there was no cancer.

Your own values and preferences are therefore important in deciding about mammography.


For example, if you worry about having breast cancer more than you worry about having
extra tests, you might choose to start having mammography earlier. But if you worry
about unnecessary tests more than about breast cancer, you might choose to have mammography
later or less often.

You can talk with your doctor about your medical history and your concerns before
you make a decision about mammography.

Bear in mind that, in some places, mammograms may only be offered at certain ages
or only as often as recommended by the local guidelines."

If you've been diagnosed with breast cancer you may want to talk to your doctor to
find out more.
Here are some questions you might want to ask.


Has my breast cancer spread outside my breast? What stage is my cancer?


How big is my tumour?


Can I have surgery that removes only the lump (breast-conserving surgery) and not
the whole breast (mastectomy)?



Did my breast cancer happen because of genes I have inherited?


What will you do to find out if my breast cancer has spread to the lymph nodes in
my armpit and to other nodes?



What treatment will I need after surgery?


What side effects can I expect from surgery and other treatments?


Is my breast cancer affected by the hormone oestrogen (is it oestrogen-receptor positive)?




Do I have HER-2 positive breast cancer (this means the cancer cells make too much
of a protein called HER-2)?



Will my surgery be done by a specialist breast surgeon who does more than 20 breast
operations a year? (This can be a difficult question to ask, but the risk of your
cancer coming back where it first started depends on whether your surgeon removes
enough of the tissue around your cancer along with the cancer itself. Research suggests
that experienced surgeons are better at doing this.)



Do any of my lymph nodes have cancer cells in them? If so, how many?


How abnormal do the cancer cells look under a microscope? (This can tell you how likely
it is that your tumour will spread and what kind of treatment you need.)



Will I need chemotherapy after surgery? If so, what type and for how long?


Will I need radiotherapy? If so, for how long?


Will I need hormone therapy? If so, what type and for how long?


If I have a mastectomy, should I have breast-reconstruction surgery? If so, when should
it be done and what sort of surgeon should do it?



Are the other women in my family more likely than most women to get breast cancer?
Should they have check-ups more often?"

It can be frightening to be told that you have cancer cells in your breast. But breast
cancer at this very early stage can nearly always be cured. Good treatments are available.

This information is about a type of very early breast cancer called ductal carcinoma
in situ (DCIS) in women.

What happens in breast cancer?
When your body's cells are healthy they divide, grow, and are replaced in an orderly
way. But when you get cancer your cells grow too fast and don’t develop properly.
Abnormal cells form a lump called a tumour. This slowly gets bigger.

Breast cancer usually starts in thin tubes in the breast, called ducts. When women
breastfeed, the ducts carry breast milk from the milk-producing glands to the nipple.


If you have the earliest form of breast cancer, called ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS for short), the cancer cells are still inside the ducts. They haven’t yet spread into the fatty
tissue of the breast.

The first question many women ask is, ""Why me?""
A few women get breast cancer because they have inherited a gene that makes it much
more likely. Breast cancer is also much more common in older women than in younger
women.

Other things that seem to make a woman more likely to get breast cancer include:


Not having had children (or having them after the age of 30)


Not having ever breastfed


Drinking alcohol


Being very overweight (obese).


But many women who get breast cancer don't have any of these risk factors. For most
women there's no obvious reason why they get breast cancer.

What are the symptoms?
Unlike women with more-advanced breast cancer, if you have DCIS you won't usually
have any symptoms. For example, you won't feel ill and you won't usually be able to
feel a lump in your breast. This is because the cluster of cancer cells is too tiny
to be able to feel or to cause any problems that you would be aware of.

Women who have DCIS usually find out after they have a mammogram. A mammogram is an
x-ray of the breast.

As well as detecting clusters of cancer cells, mammograms can also detect small lumps
of calcium in the breast, called microcalcifications. These are usually not linked
to cancer. But they can sometimes be a sign that cancer is starting to develop.

What treatments work?
Different types of breast cancer need different treatment.


Most women with DCIS have an operation to remove the cancer cells.


You might also need to have radiotherapy after surgery.


Depending on the type of cancer cells, you might also take a medicine called tamoxifen
after surgery.



Surgery
Most women with DCIS can have an operation called breast-conserving surgery. You might also have heard this operation called a lumpectomy. This removes the cancer cells and a small amount of surrounding breast tissue, but
it leaves the healthy breast tissue in place.

Your surgeon will try to leave your breast looking as much as possible like it did
before. But you will have a small scar afterwards and your breast will probably look
different. Talk to your surgeon about how you can expect your breast to look after
surgery.

But if you have DCIS in more than one place, or if the amount of DCIS is very large
compared with the size of your breast, you may need to have the whole breast removed.
This is called mastectomy.

For either type of surgery you’ll have a general anaesthetic, so you won't be awake
during the operation and won’t feel any pain. You will need pain relief afterwards.
Be sure to ask the nurses for more pain relief if you are in discomfort.

If you have breast-conserving surgery your surgeon will remove the cancer cells through
a small cut in your breast.

If you have surgery to remove your whole breast you might have more peace of mind
that all the cancer has been removed. But many women find it difficult to come to
terms with losing a breast. Reconstruction surgery to replace your breast tissue with an implant may help. You might be able to have
your breast removed and reconstructed during the same operation.

As with any type of operation, surgery for DCIS carries some risks. These include
getting an infection in the wound, or having an allergic reaction to the anaesthetic.

Some women get fluid under the scar (a seroma) or bleeding under the cut, which causes
a large bruise (a haematoma). A seroma can be drained with a needle. If you have a
lot of bleeding you may need another operation to stop it. A mastectomy is a more
serious operation than breast-conserving surgery and it may take you longer to recover.


If you are finding it hard to decide which operation to have, take your time and talk
to your doctors and nurses about the options. You don’t have to rush into a decision.
Waiting a week or two won’t make a difference.

Radiotherapy
Radiotherapy is usually only used for women with DCIS who have breast-conserving surgery.
It's not usually necessary for women with DCIS who have a mastectomy.

Unless your doctor thinks it's highly unlikely that your DCIS will come back, he or
she will probably recommend that you have radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery, to reduce the chance of recurrence.

The chance of your DCIS returning is smaller if the area of DCIS in your breast is
very small and the cells don't look like they are growing very fast under a microscope.

Radiotherapy uses x-rays to destroy cancer cells in your breast. If you have radiotherapy
you'll need sessions several days a week for between four and six weeks. Each session
takes only a few minutes.

Having radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery reduces the chance of cancer coming
back in your breast and reduces the chance that you'll need to have your breast removed
because your cancer has spread.

Radiotherapy doesn't hurt, but it has side effects. Your skin may itch or change colour
after treatment, and your breast may feel tender. Some women say that having radiotherapy
makes them feel tired. These problems are usually mild and go away after a few weeks.


A few people get nerve damage or inflammation in their lungs some time after radiotherapy.
But newer techniques minimise the dose of radiation and reduce the chance of harm.

Tamoxifen
Some breast cancer cells grow when they come into contact with the female hormone
oestrogen. They are called oestrogen receptor positive. Other cells, called progesterone
receptor-positive cells, grow when they come into contact with the hormone progesterone.
You might hear these two types of cancer cells called hormone receptor positive.

Your cancer cells will be tested to see if they are hormone receptor positive. If
they are, your doctor may recommend you take a drug called tamoxifen. It blocks the
effects of the hormones.

If you have hormone receptor-positive cancer, taking tamoxifen after surgery and radiotherapy
reduces your chance of your DCIS returning. It also reduces the chance that you'll
get breast cancer that spreads into the breast tissue.

If you have had breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy that affected one breast,
treatment with tamoxifen also reduces the chance of cancer developing in the other
breast.

Because tamoxifen stops these hormones working in your body, it can cause symptoms
of the menopause, such as hot flushes, irregular periods, and vaginal dryness.

Tamoxifen may also cause indigestion or make you feel sick. Tamoxifen can also cause
side effects such as cataracts and deep vein thrombosis, but this is rare.

What will happen to me?
Women now live longer after being diagnosed with breast cancer than ever before, especially
if the cancer is at an early stage. Women whose cancer has not spread outside the
ducts (DCIS) are nearly always cured.

Where to get more help
There are many charities and support groups for women with breast cancer. For example,
in the UK, Breast Cancer Care (www.breastcancercare.org.uk) is a charity that provides
advice and practical support to women with breast cancer.

Talk to your doctor about charities, online support groups, or support groups in your
area."

Breast-conserving surgery is an operation to remove breast cancer without removing
the whole breast. You might also hear it called a “lumpectomy”.

This operation isn’t suitable for everyone with breast cancer. But where it is suitable,
it’s just as successful as removing the whole breast.

Here, we look at how this operation is done, how it might help you, and what the risks
might be. You can use our information to talk with your doctor about the best treatment
for you.

What is breast-conserving surgery?
Many women with breast cancer need to have their entire breast removed. This is called
a mastectomy. But if you have a small tumour, or cancer that has not spread far, you might be
able to have breast-conserving surgery instead.

This means that the tissue that is affected by cancer, but not the whole breast, is
removed. The aim is to change the appearance of the breast as little as possible.

Who can have breast-conserving surgery?
You might be able to have breast-conserving surgery instead of a mastectomy if:


you have early breast cancer. This means that the cancer hasn't spread outside your breast, or has spread only
as far as the nearest lymph nodes. Lymph nodes are small round or oval lumps. They
help fight infections in your body. Breast cancer usually spreads to the lymph nodes
in your armpit before it spreads anywhere else.



you have only one lump in your breast. If you have more than one lump, or several small patches of cancer
cells, breast-conserving surgery might not be suitable.



your lump is small compared with the size of your breast. If you have a small lump, you'll only have
a small scar, and the shape of your breast might not change much.



you can have radiotherapy. You might need radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery. Doctors try to avoid
giving radiotherapy to the same area twice, so you might not be able to have breast-conserving
surgery if you've had radiotherapy before. If you are pregnant, you might want to
avoid radiotherapy, as it could harm your baby.



But breast-conserving surgery isn't suitable for everyone. If you have a large lump
and a small breast, or if you have cancer under your nipple, it can be difficult to
remove the cancer without changing the way your breast looks. You might get a better
result with a mastectomy and breast reconstruction.

There are several kinds of breast reconstruction available, including surgery to put
in implants. And you might be able to have your breast removed and reconstructed during
the same operation.

Your doctor will be able to give you advice about all the kinds of surgery that are
available. But it might be that only one type is suitable for you.

What will happen during the surgery?
Before the operation
You might have chemotherapy or hormone therapy before your operation to shrink the
cancer. Having these medications can make your lump easier to remove, but they have
side effects. Your doctor should discuss these with you, so that you know what to
expect.

If your surgeon can't feel the lump in your breast, you might need to have a mammogram
(an x-ray of your breast). The surgeon will then use the mammogram to guide a thin
wire through your skin to mark the cancer.

The wire is left in place during surgery to show the surgeon which part of your breast
to remove.

Most women have a general anaesthetic for this operation. But if your general health
isn't good, your surgeon might recommend a local anaesthetic. You still won’t feel
anything, but you’ll be awake.

If you have a general anaesthetic, you won't be able to eat anything for eight hours
before the operation or drink anything for up to two hours before.

During the operation
Breast-conserving surgery usually takes between 15 and 40 minutes.You should be able
to go home the same day, although some women stay in hospital overnight.

During the operation your surgeon will:


make a small cut across your breast above the cancer. He or she will try to make the
cut as small as possible. Your surgeon shouldn't need to cut away any skin unless
the cancer is just under the skin's surface



cut away the cancer along with a small amount (about 2 millimetres, or one-twelfth
of an inch) of healthy-looking tissue. Removing tissue around the cancer or lump is
called taking a margin. It's done to reduce the chance of leaving any cancer cells
behind



move some of your breast tissue around to fill the hole left by the cancer and keep
your breast as close as possible to its original shape



sew up the cut on your breast with one long stitch that will dissolve later.


If your surgeon had to remove more than a small amount of your breast, the hole left
behind can be filled with a piece of muscle from your back.

Removing lymph nodes
For some types of breast cancer, your surgeon might need to remove some or all of
the lymph nodes in your armpit. When breast cancer spreads, it usually reaches these
nodes first.

If you have a type of early breast cancer called ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS),
you won't need any lymph nodes removed.

Depending on exactly where your cancer is, your surgeon might be able to reach your
lymph nodes through the cut in your breast, so that you don’t need two cuts.

You may only need some of the nodes removed, depending on how far your cancer is likely
to have spread. For example, your surgeon might:



remove all 20 or so lymph nodes from your armpit


remove several lymph nodes from the lowest part of your armpit and test them for cancer
cells. If these are clear of cancer, the ones higher up are unlikely to be affected,
and they won’t be removed



inject radioactive dye into your breast to find the lymph node, or nodes, that fluid
from your breast drains into first. These nodes are then tested. If they are cancer
free, the other lymph nodes will be too.



Radiotherapy after your operation
Radiotherapy is used after surgery to kill any cancer cells that may have been left
behind. It uses x-rays to destroy cancer cells in your breast.

You'll need to have radiotherapy five days a week for between four weeks and six weeks.
Each session only takes a few minutes. Radiotherapy doesn't hurt, but it has side
effects. Your doctor should discuss these with you in detail.

If your doctor thinks that there’s an above-average chance that your cancer will return,
or if you haven't had all your lymph nodes removed, you might need radiotherapy directed
at the lymph nodes in your armpit.

What are the advantages of this type of breast surgery?
If breast-conserving surgery is suitable for you, it means that:


you'll be able to keep your breast, although it won't look the same as it did before


your scar will be small compared with a mastectomy scar. The exact size of your scar
will depend on how much breast tissue is removed



you are likely to feel better about how your body looks, compared with having a mastectomy


you won't need to wear a false breast or have surgery to reconstruct your breast.


Can the cancer return after this surgery?
As long as this type of surgery is suitable for you, it’s just as successful as a
mastectomy at curing breast cancer.

There is a chance that cancer can return after breast-conserving surgery. This seems
to be more likely the younger you are.

Having radiotherapy as well as surgery greatly reduces the chance of the cancer returning.
The vast majority of women who have both treatments don’t get breast cancer again.
But if the cancer returns you will probably need to have the whole breast removed.

What are the risks of this surgery?
All operations have risks, especially if you have other existing health problems.
Your surgeon should discuss these risks with you before the operation.

This might look like a long list of possible risks and complications. But these are
just things that might happen. You aren’t likely to be affected by all of them, and
you might not be affected by any.

The risks of breast-conserving surgery include:


problems with the anaesthetic. Some people are allergic to the anaesthetic, which
can be serious. But you will be closely monitored for any problems



not enough tissue being removed along with the lump. This can happen if the cancer
has spread further than your surgeon expected. The tissue removed during the operation
will be checked, and if your surgeon thinks some cancer could have been left behind,
you might need a second operation



your scar being bigger than you had expected, or your breast shape changing more than
you hoped. If you are unhappy with how your breast looks, you might be able to have
more surgery to improve the appearance of your breast



infection. This is a risk with any kind of operation. It can usually be treated easily
with antibiotics



fluid collecting under the scar. This is fairly common. The fluid can be drained with
a needle by a doctor or nurse



bleeding under the cut that the surgeon made, that happens some time after the operation.
If the blood builds up and clots, it can cause a large bruise called a haematoma.
If this happens, you might need surgery to remove the blood clot or to stop any bleeding.



Having the lymph nodes removed can also lead to complications in some people, including:


pain and discomfort under your arm, which can last for a few weeks


a stiff shoulder. This is fairly common. Painkillers and gentle stretching can help


numbness or tingling in your arm, shoulder, or breast. This can happen when nerves
near the lymph nodes are damaged during surgery. It usually gets better after a few
months



swelling of the arm and armpit (called lymphoedema). This can start right away or
later - sometimes years later. It might only last a few weeks, but it can become an
ongoing problem. Your arm can feel heavy and sore. Wearing a close-fitting elastic
sleeve can help prevent the swelling. Gentle massage and physiotherapy can also help



fluid collecting under the scar in your armpit. This is part of the normal healing
process and should get better by itself.



Radiotherapy can also sometimes lead to complications, including:


itchy, tender or painful skin. This can last for several months


feeling more tired than usual. This usually gets better after a few weeks


some of the breast tissue feeling hard and changing shape slightly. This is called
fibrosis



nerve and lung damage. These problems usually start some time after the operation.
These are rare complications and can be treated



the hair in your armpit might stop growing.


What can I expect afterwards?
Immediately after the operation
When you leave the operating theatre, you'll go to the recovery area until you are
fully awake. You'll probably have a thin tube (a cannula) in the vein in the back
of your hand where you were given the anaesthetic.

If you had a local anaesthetic, the parts of your breast and armpit where the cuts
were made will feel numb for several hours.

You'll have a bandage over your wound, and possibly a plastic tube running from your
wounds to drain away the blood and lymph fluid that builds up during the healing process.

Your nurse will give you painkillers if you need them. If the first ones you try don't
work, tell your nurse or doctor. You might need a stronger dose or another type of
drug. Don't try to put up with pain, as this can slow your recovery.

The sooner you get up and move about, the better you'll feel. You will be shown arm
exercises you can do to stop your arm getting stiff.

Going home
You might feel anxious about seeing your breast for the first time after the operation.
Remember that it takes a while for your breast to settle down after surgery, and that
your scar will fade over time.

You can wash your breast after a few days, but dry it carefully. Wear a comfortable
bra as soon as you can, to help support your breasts.

Avoid strenuous activities such as lifting or sport until your wounds have healed
and there's no swelling in your arm. You can go back to work as soon as you feel ready.

Your breast might have changed in shape and size, depending on how much tissue was
removed. This can affect how you feel about your body. Give yourself time to adjust.
You can talk through your feelings and worries with those close to you or your breast
cancer nurse."

It can be frightening to be told that you have breast cancer. But good treatments
are available. Women with breast cancer now have a much better chance of surviving
their illness than they did in the past.

You can use our information to talk to your doctor and decide which treatments are
best for you.

What treatments work?
Women who have locally advanced breast cancer often need to have surgery to remove
the breast that has the tumour.

But some women may be able to have breast-conserving surgery. This means that just
the tumour is removed and most of the breast tissue is left intact. Improved breast-scanning
techniques mean that more women are now able to have breast-conserving surgery. You
can discuss with your doctor which type of surgery is the right one for you.

Other treatments that can help stop breast cancer spreading or returning include:




chemotherapy (drugs that kill cancer cells)


radiotherapy (x-rays that kill cancer cells)


hormone therapy.


Surgery
Mastectomy
The operation to remove a complete breast is called a total mastectomy. All of the breast tissue is removed along with some of the skin over the breast
and the nipple. Some lymph nodes in the armpit are also removed.

Doctors used to do an operation called a radical mastectomy, which also removed some of the muscles under the breast. But this is not usually
done any more, because for most women a total mastectomy works just as well.

A mastectomy is a serious operation. As with any operation, there are risks. For example:




fluid sometimes builds up around the scar on your chest and in your upper arm. You
may need to have this fluid drained in hospital



removing the breast cannot guarantee that the area around your breast will be free
from cancer cells. The breast cancer could return in the scar. But this is rare



you could get an infection in the wound and need antibiotics.


Many women find it hard to come to terms with losing a breast. Breast reconstruction
surgery may help. You may be able to have your breast removed and reconstructed during
the same operation.

Breast-conserving surgery
In this operation the surgeon removes the tumour but leaves the breast intact. You
might have heard it also called lumpectomy. The aim is to remove the cancer while changing the appearance of the breast as little
as possible.

But this operation isn't suitable for all women with locally advanced breast cancer.
Often the cancer has spread so far that it's safest to remove the whole breast.

Chemotherapy (cancer drugs)
Most women who have locally advanced breast cancer have chemotherapy. It’s the standard
treatment.

Chemotherapy drugs kill stray cancer cells left in the body. Chemotherapy is used
after breast surgery and radiotherapy to:



reduce the chance of breast cancer coming back


reduce the chance that breast cancer will spread further, and


control breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body.


Some women have chemotherapy before surgery to reduce the size of their tumour and
make it easier to remove their breast.

Some chemotherapy drugs are given as tablets and others as a drip. You may get treatment
at a clinic or hospital as an outpatient. You'll probably need to take a combination
of drugs for several months.

Chemotherapy can have unpleasant side effects. You may feel sick and vomit during
or after your treatment. You may also lose your hair, put on weight, and get symptoms
of the menopause.

A lot of women feel very tired during chemotherapy. This tiredness may be overwhelming,
and it can continue after you stop treatment. It’s a good idea to arrange help from
friends and family while you’re having chemotherapy, to help with everyday tasks like
shopping and cooking.

Drugs for HER2-positive cancer
About 1 in 5 women with breast cancer have a type called HER2-positive breast cancer.
These cancers grow faster and are more likely to come back than cancers that are HER2
negative.

Women with HER2-positive disease may be offered drugs called monoclonal antibodies.
These drugs slow down or stop the growth of HER2 cancer cells. You may have heard
of one called Herceptin (trastuzumab).

But monoclonal antibodies can cause side effects, including serious heart and lung
problems. So women who have HER2-positive breast cancer are carefully checked to see
if they are healthy enough to be treated with these drugs. Women are also monitored
throughout their treatment.

Radiotherapy
If you have locally advanced breast cancer, having radiotherapy after surgery may
reduce the chance that your breast cancer will come back. Radiotherapy may also help
you live longer.

Radiotherapy uses radiation to kill any cancer cells in your breast left behind after
surgery. If you have radiotherapy you will probably need sessions several times a
week for several weeks.

Your doctor may suggest radiotherapy if there's a high risk that your cancer will
come back in the chest wall. You may be at higher risk of your cancer coming back
if your cancer is large and is growing quickly, or you have cancer in lots of your
underarm lymph nodes.

Your skin may itch or change colour after radiotherapy, and your breast may feel tender.
Some women feel more tired than usual. These problems are usually mild and go away
after a few weeks.

A few people get nerve damage or inflammation (swelling) in their lungs some time
after radiotherapy. These problems sound serious, but they are rare and they can be
treated.

Radiotherapy and mastectomy treat only the breast area. If you have locally advanced
cancer, you will also need chemotherapy to stop cancer spreading further and growing
in other parts of your body.

Hormone therapy
Some women have hormone treatment (sometimes called endocrine therapy) after chemotherapy
or radiation. You may have heard of a treatment called tamoxifen, which is commonly
used to treat breast cancer. But there are others, including drugs called aromatase
inhibitors.

The type of hormone treatment you are offered might depend on whether you have been
through the menopause. For example, aromatase inhibitors only work for women who are
post menopausal (have been through the menopause).

Tamoxifen and other hormone treatments are used to treat breast cancers that are sensitive
to the hormone oestrogen. Oestrogen encourages these cancers to grow.

Your doctor will do tests on your tumour to find out if it is oestrogen-receptor positive
or progesterone-receptor positive. If it is, your doctor may prescribe tamoxifen or
another hormone treatment for you for up to five years.

These treatments stop oestrogen from working in the body. The aim is to reduce the
chance that your cancer will come back.

Tamoxifen can cause side effects in some women, including symptoms of the menopause.
This is more common if you haven't been through the menopause already. About half
the women taking tamoxifen get one or more side effects, such as:



hot flushes


irregular periods


vaginal dryness, and


indigestion or nausea.


Rare side effects of tamoxifen include cataracts and deep vein thrombosis.
Aromatase inhibitors can cause stiffness and pain in the muscles and joints.
Treatments during pregnancy
Treatment for women who had breast cancer while pregnant used to be mastectomy, with
chemotherapy and radiotherapy delayed until after the birth.

But newer evidence suggests that some pregnant women might be able to have breast-conserving
surgery, along with chemotherapy in the later stages of pregnancy, without harming
their baby.

Radiotherapy still has to wait until after the birth.
Drugs to prevent bone damage (osteoporosis) caused by cancer treatments
Some cancer treatments can cause bones to become weaker, which makes fractures more
likely. Drugs called bisphosphonates can help reduce this bone damage and help prevent
fractures. But it's possible that they only help women who have been through the menopause."

What is locally advanced breast cancer?
When your body's cells are healthy they divide, grow, and are replaced in an orderly
way. But if you get cancer some of your cells grow too fast and don’t develop properly.
These abnormal cells form a lump called a tumour. This gradually gets bigger.

Breast cancer usually starts in thin tubes in the breast, called ducts. When women
breastfeed, the ducts carry breast milk from the milk-producing glands to the nipple.


If you have invasive breast cancer it means that cancer cells have spread beyond the
ducts into the fatty tissue of your breast. From there it can spread around your body.


Early breast cancer is cancer that is still within your breast. It might also be in
glands under your arms, called lymph nodes.

If the tumour is large (5 centimetres or more across) or has spread to the skin or
the front of the chest, this is locally advanced breast cancer. The lymph nodes under the armpit might also have become matted together by the tumour.


What causes breast cancer?
The first question many women ask is: ""Why me?"" A few women get breast cancer because
they have inherited a gene that makes it much more likely. But for most people there
is no obvious cause.

You are more likely to get breast cancer when you are older. There are some other
things that are linked to a greater chance of getting breast cancer, such as not having
had children (or not having given birth before the age of 30), never having breastfed,
drinking alcohol, and being very overweight (obese). But many women who get breast
cancer don't have any of these 'risk factors'.

What are the symptoms?
Many women learn that they have breast cancer before they get any symptoms. They find
out after they have a mammogram. A mammogram is an x-ray of the breast. Mammograms
can reveal lumps that are too small to feel.

Symptoms of breast cancer include:


a lump or thickening in your breast


a change in how your breast feels or looks. For example, it may feel heavy, warm,
or uneven, or the skin may look pitted



changes in your nipple. For example, the nipple might be pulled back into the breast
(known as an inverted nipple)



discharge from your nipple, such as blood.


Before you are diagnosed with breast cancer, you may have an ultrasound scan of your
breast. Your doctor might also remove some tissue from your breast lump, often by
using a needle. This is called a biopsy. The doctors will examine the tissue for cancer
cells.

What will happen to me?
It’s hard to predict what will happen to you, because everyone responds differently
to treatment. The good news is that more women are now living longer after being diagnosed
with breast cancer.

Breast cancer can sometimes come back, so you will probably always need to be watchful
for symptoms and have regular check-ups as advised by your doctor.

However, if breast cancer is going to come back, it's most likely to do so within
the first two years.

Where to get more help
There are many charities and support groups for women with breast cancer. For example,
in the UK, Breast Cancer Care (breastcancernow.org) is a charity that provides advice
and practical support to women with breast cancer.

You can ask your doctor about support in your area."

Bradycardia means that your heart beats more slowly than it should, either all the
time or for short spells. In some people it doesn’t cause problems or need treatment.
But for others it can be dangerous and even life threatening without treatment.

You can use our information to talk with your doctor about the best treatments for
you.

What is bradycardia?
If you have bradycardia your heart beats more slowly than it should. This can mean
that blood doesn’t get pumped around your body quickly enough.

This can cause several types of problem. For example, it can lead to more serious
heart problems, including heart failure; and it can cause dizziness and fainting,
leading to falls and injuries.

You might have heard of a device for treating heart problems called a pacemaker. In fact, the heart has its own natural pacemaker that controls your heartbeat with
electrical signals.

Bradycardia is what happens when the heart’s natural pacemaker stops working properly.
This can be a condition in itself, or it can be caused by other things, including:


getting older


physical damage to the heart and blood vessels: for example, from a puncture wound,
or from heart surgery



having too little of some minerals. These minerals are called electrolytes. If you
don’t have enough of any of them, it can cause bradycardia



some infections


some medications. For example, some antidepressants and some blood-pressure drugs
and cause the heart to slow down, and



some medical conditions. For example, thyroid problems can sometimes slow down your
heart.


What should my heart rate be?
Your heart rate - the speed at which your heart pumps blood - varies depending on
what you are doing. For example, if you are exercising, excited, or stressed, your
heart rate goes up; when you are resting or relaxed it slows down.

When you are resting, the speed of your heartbeat is called your resting heart rate. This is what your doctor will measure when deciding if you have bradycardia.

Everybody is different, so “normal” resting heart rate varies from person to person.
In adults it can be anywhere between 60 and 100 beats per minute (bpm).

Many things affect your resting heart rate, such as your age, weight, and level of
physical fitness. For example, a 20-year-old athlete will probably have a very low
resting heart rate, while an older person who doesn��t exercise much will have a much
higher rate.

A resting rate that is too high can increase your chance of having heart problems:
for example, for most adults, 80 bpm is usually thought to be getting a bit too high.

But your heart rate can also be too low, either all the time, or for short spells.
This is bradycardia. Doctors usually say that if your resting heart rate is below
50 beats per minute, you have bradycardia.

What are the symptoms?
Symptoms of bradycardia include:

feeling dizzy or light headed


fainting


feeling tired much of the time


shortness of breath, and


getting tired very quickly when exercising.

You get these symptoms because your heart is not pumping blood and oxygen around your
body quickly enough to keep you active.

It’s possible to have bradycardia that isn’t a problem and that doesn’t cause any
symptoms. For example, if you are young and fit, or if you are an athlete, then a
low heart rate might be normal for you, and it would not be a concern.

But most people with bradycardia are not young and fit. And the only way to know if
you need treatment is to see your doctor. If you think you have a very low heart rate,
have it checked.

If your doctor thinks you might have bradycardia, he or she will examine you physically.
Your doctor will check for possible signs of bradycardia, including:


swelling in the legs and abdomen


swelling in the veins in the neck


cold fingers and toes


unusual heart sounds, and


signs of thyroid problems, such as facial swelling, and coarse skin and hair.

You might also need some tests. These could include:

an ECG (electrocardiogram). With this test, sensors attached to your skin monitor
the electrical signals in your heart to see how well your natural pacemaker is working




exercise testing using a treadmill. Your doctor will check whether your heart rate
goes up enough when you exercise



blood tests


a test called Holter monitoring. This involves wearing a small monitor around your
shoulder that checks your heart rate over several days



a longer test called event monitoring. This involves wearing a small monitor for several
weeks. When you have symptoms, such as fainting or dizziness, you press a button and
the device records what is happening in your heart



carotid sinus massage. Your doctor tests what happens to your heart rate while gently
pressing the carotid artery in your neck. If your heart rate drops a lot, it’s a sign
of bradycardia.


What treatments work?
If you have bradycardia that isn’t causing you problems, or that’s caused by something
that can be treated in another way, you probably don’t need treatment for bradycardia.

For example:

thyroid problems can usually be treated with drugs


a lack of electrolytes is usually easily treated with simple changes to your diet,
and



bradycardia caused by medications can be treated with careful changes to the medications
you take.


If you do need treatment, you will probably be seen by a heart specialist (cardiologist).
If your bradycardia is making you feel very unwell, your treatment will probably start
with medicines to help increase your blood pressure and help your heart to beat faster.

Your treatment is also likely to involve what’s called pacing. This means using an
electrical device called a pacemaker to help your heart to beat at a level that’s
better for your health.

Depending on your individual needs, pacing can be either temporary or permanent.
With permanent pacing, you have a pacemaker fitted into your chest or abdomen. This might sound like a
major operation, but modern pacemakers are very small. The procedure can usually be
done under local anaesthetic, and you can usually go home within 24 hours.

Temporary pacing can be done either as short-term emergency treatment, or as a short treatment when
someone’s symptoms are not so severe that they need a permanent pacemaker.

Temporary pacing can be done either by attaching electrical pads to the skin, or by
inserting a tiny pacemaker into the heart through a vein. The treatment lasts for
between a few minutes and a few days, depending on how much you need.

Temporary pacing through a vein works better, but it is more likely to cause complications,
such as infections. Your doctor should discuss any complications and side effects
with you before you have treatment.

Some people with severe bradycardia have a small device called a defibrillator fitted alongside a pacemaker. If the heart rate becomes dangerously slow, the defibrillator
delivers a brief electric current that should nudge it back to the right speed. But
most people don’t need this treatment.

What will happen?
Even if you have bradycardia that doesn’t need treatment, you should stay alert for
any symptoms that might happen, such as dizziness, and see your doctor if they happen.

If you have bradycardia that has a cause that can be treated, such as a thyroid condition
or low electrolytes, you will probably just need treatment for that problem.

But if you have bradycardia that’s caused by a problem with the heart’s natural pacemaker,
you will need long-term monitoring and treatment by a cardiologist.

For example, if you have had a pacemaker fitted, your cardiologist will check it soon
after it has been fitted, then after a couple of months, then every year.

He or she will check things such as whether the battery needs to be replaced, and
whether the device has recorded any unusual heart activity.

Your cardiologist will also ask you to keep an eye on your symptoms, and to monitor
your heart rate.

He or she might ask you to keep a symptom diary and to keep a record of any big changes
in your heart rate. He or she can then recommend any necessary changes to your treatment."

Bowel cancer is a serious disease, but it can often be cured if it's caught early.
You can use our information to talk to your doctor and decide which treatments are
right for you.

What is bowel cancer?
The term 'bowel cancer' includes cancers of the colon and rectum, which make up the
upper and lower part of your large bowel. Bowel cancer is sometimes called colorectal
cancer.

Your large bowel turns food your body doesn't need into solid waste. The waste then
leaves your body when you go to the toilet.

Bowel cancer starts when some of the cells in your large bowel begin to grow out of
control. This can form a lump called a tumour. Cancer cells can then break off from
the tumour and spread to other parts of your body and cause damage there.

Your doctor will probably talk about what 'stage' your cancer is. 'Staging' cancers
is all about how big they have grown and how far they have spread. So:



stage I bowel cancer is at an early stage and is usually treatable. About 95 in 100
people with stage I bowel cancer are still alive five years after diagnosis



stages II and III are larger and less easy to treat. But many people can still be
cured. About 80 in 100 people with stage II bowel cancer are still alive after 5 years.
For stage III bowel cancer, the number varies between 45 and 85 in 100



stage IV (4) bowel cancer is hard to treat, and most people are not cured. About 8
in 100 people are still alive after 5 years.



What treatments are available?
Cancer that grows in your bowels can be treated. You have a good chance of being cured
if the cancer hasn't spread very far in your bowel.

Surgery is the main treatment for most people. You may also need radiotherapy or chemotherapy,
or both.

What treatment you have depends on several things, including:


where the cancer is


how much it has spread,


your general health, and


your individual preferences.


Surgery
Most people with bowel cancer are treated with surgery. If your cancer is caught fairly
early, your surgeon will try to remove all the cancer cells. This gives you a chance
of getting rid of your cancer completely.

If your cancer has spread beyond your bowel, into other organs such as your liver
and lungs, surgery won't cure you. But it can help to improve your quality of life
and help you to live longer.

For example, your surgeon might recommend an operation to remove as much of the cancer
as possible, or to clear a blockage in your bowel.

You might also have surgery on your liver or lungs if the cancer has spread to these
organs.

The type of surgery you will need depends on:


where the cancer is


how big it is, and


how far it has spread.


Bowel cancer usually starts in small growths called polyps. If you have a polyp, your doctor may remove it during your colonoscopy.

If the polyp tests positive for cancer cells but these cells seem to be all contained
within the polyp, then you may not need any further surgery. However, to be sure all
the cancer cells are gone, your doctor may recommend removing some of the tissue around
the polyp.

If the tumour is bigger, you may need an operation to remove part of your bowel. A
section is cut away and the ends from either side are joined together. Your surgeon
may also need to remove some extra tissue from around your bowel.

Surgery for bowel cancer can be done through a cut in your abdomen (open surgery)
and also often as keyhole surgery. That's when tiny instruments are put through small
cuts in your body.

Keyhole surgery seems to work just as well as open surgery. And you're likely to recover
more quickly afterwards.

The part of your large bowel called your colon is quite long. So an operation to remove
part of it may not have much impact on your life afterwards.

Your rectum (the last part of your large bowel before the anus) is much shorter. Surgery
in this area is more difficult.

There's a chance you could need a colostomy after surgery. If you have a colostomy, the surgeon makes a hole in your abdomen.
Part of your bowel is then attached to this hole.

Waste from your bowel then travels out through the hole in your abdomen, instead of
travelling out through your rectum. The waste is collected in a bag.

Not everyone who has rectal cancer will need a colostomy. And some people need a colostomy
only temporarily, while their bowel heals.

Lots of people worry about having a colostomy. But even if you do need one you'll
get plenty of help learning to cope.

Modern technology means that a colostomy is much less inconvenient than it used to
be. The bags are small and they don't show through your clothes. They usually have
a filter, so they don't smell. And a colostomy shouldn't stop you doing things you
did before, such as playing sport.

After surgery, you'll need to stay in hospital for a few days. If you get pain, make
sure you talk to a doctor or nurse. They'll be able to give you medicine to help treat
your pain.

Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill cancer cells. These drugs can be used to treat cancer
before or after surgery. They can also be used if surgery isn't possible.

Chemotherapy drugs affect your whole body, so they're good for killing any cancer
cells that might have been missed by surgery. Having chemotherapy before surgery can
also help to shrink the cancer to make it easier to remove.

There are several chemotherapy drugs that can be used. They are usually given as injections.
Chemotherapy drugs are sometimes used along with medicines called monoclonal antibodies.
These help the chemotherapy drugs work better.

Having chemotherapy helps people with bowel cancer live longer. But it has side effects.
These include diarrhoea, swelling in your mouth and throat, and feeling very tired.

Some people feel sick while having chemotherapy. You may be given other drugs to stop
you feeling sick. Some people get problems with their blood that mean they bleed more
easily and pick up more infections. You may also lose your hair.

Radiotherapy
Radiotherapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill cancer cells. It's not usually used for
cancer in the colon, but it is sometimes used to treat cancer in the rectum.

Your doctor may recommend having radiotherapy to shrink your tumour before surgery,
possibly combined with chemotherapy. This makes it easier for your surgeon to cut
away all the cancer cells.

Radiotherapy is also sometimes used with chemotherapy after surgery. The aim is to
kill any cancer cells left behind after your operation.

You'll need to go to hospital to have radiotherapy. A machine aims a beam of radiation
into the spot where your cancer is. You'll be given small doses of treatment each
day for several days or weeks.

Radiotherapy doesn't usually hurt, although you'll have to stay still for a minute
or so during treatment. This can be uncomfortable. Side effects during radiotherapy
include feeling very tired, feeling sick, or getting diarrhoea.

Other problems can happen after treatment, including having problems controlling your
bowels or having a blocked bowel, which may need emergency surgery.

If radiotherapy damages the nerves in your abdomen, you could have problems during
sex. Men might find it hard to get an erection, and women can get a dry vagina.

What is bowel cancer?
The term 'bowel cancer' includes cancers of the colon and rectum, which make up the
upper and lower part of your large bowel. Bowel cancer is sometimes called colorectal
cancer.

Your large bowel turns food your body doesn't need into solid waste. The waste then
leaves your body when you go to the toilet.

Bowel cancer starts when some of the cells in your large bowel begin to grow out of
control. This can form a lump called a tumour. Cancer cells can then break off from
the tumour and spread to other parts of your body and cause damage there.

What are the symptoms?
You might not get any symptoms in the early stages of bowel cancer. Some people only
find out they have it when they go for a routine screening test. (To learn more, see
the leaflet Bowel cancer: should I be screened?)

But some people do get symptoms. These can include:


changes in your bowel habits that last for several weeks. For example, you may get
diarrhoea or become constipated. Or your stools may be thinner than usual. This can
happen if the cancer has partly blocked your bowel



bleeding from your rectum or visible blood in your stools. If you have bleeding in
your bowel, you may become anaemic. This can make you feel very tired and look pale



severe pain in your abdomen.


If your doctor thinks you may have bowel cancer, you'll need tests. One of the main
tests is called a colonoscopy.

During a colonoscopy, a specialist doctor (called a gastroenterologist) puts a tube
with a camera on the end (a colonoscope) into your anus and passes it up into your
rectum and colon. This allows the doctor to look for problems such as cancer.

If the doctor sees anything unusual during the test, he or she can take a sample of
tissue to look at more closely. This is called a biopsy. Other tests you may have
include scans, x-rays, and blood tests.

Together, these tests can tell you for certain whether or not you have cancer. If
you do have cancer, they can also help your doctor work out how advanced it is.

Your doctor might describe how advanced your cancer is by saying it's at a certain
stage. For example:



stage I bowel cancer means that it hasn't spread very far. This is the easiest stage
of bowel cancer to treat



stage II and III cancers have spread farther than stage I cancer but are usually still
treatable



stage IV (4) bowel cancer is the most advanced and is the hardest stage to treat.


What will happen to me?
Bowel cancer is a serious illness. But many people are cured with treatment. Your
doctor will be able to tell you about how many people recover, on average, from the
stage and type of cancer you have.

In general, the earlier you were diagnosed and the earlier the stage of your cancer,
the better. But, remember, you are not a statistic. No one can say exactly what will
happen to you. What we know in general is that:



about 95 in 100 people with stage I bowel cancer are still alive five years after
being diagnosed



about 80 in 100 people with stage II bowel cancer are still alive five years after
diagnosis



for stage III bowel cancer, the number varies between about 45 and 85 in 100 people,
depending on complications



stage IV cancer is very hard to treat. Only about 8 in 100 people with stage IV bowel
cancer are alive five years after diagnosis.



You'll have regular check-ups after being treated for bowel cancer. This is so your
doctor can find out early if your cancer returns.

If you get any symptoms that worry you, don't wait for your next check-up. See your
doctor straight away.

Bowel cancer is a serious disease, but it can often be cured if it's caught early.
To pick up early signs of bowel cancer, doctors recommend people have screening tests
as they get older or if they have a raised risk of bowel cancer.

What is bowel cancer?
Bowel cancer is one of the main causes of death from cancer in developed countries.
The cancer starts when some cells in the inside wall of the large bowel start dividing
too fast. Treatment aims to remove or kill the cancer cells and stop them spreading
to other parts of your body.

The term 'bowel cancer' includes cancers of the colon and rectum, which make up the
upper and lower part of your large bowel. Bowel cancer is sometimes called colorectal
cancer.

Your large bowel turns food your body doesn't need into solid waste. The waste then
leaves your body when you go to the toilet.

What is bowel cancer screening?
Bowel cancer screening involves looking for signs of cancer in healthy people. The
aim is to spot cancer before it starts causing problems, so treatment can be started
straight away.

Several different tests can be used for bowel cancer screening. Different countries
have different screening recommendations. So what tests you'll be offered, and at
what age, depends on where you live. However, these are the most common tests.



Faecal occult blood test (FOBT). A sample of your stool is tested for blood. If you have blood in your stool, it
might be because you have a tumour in your colon or rectum. A newer version of this
is the faecal immunochemical test (FIT). This test looks for a particular type of blood that is more likely to mean cancer.



Flexible sigmoidoscopy. A doctor puts a thin, bendy tube into your anus. This allows the doctor to look
at your rectum and the lower part of your colon.



Colonoscopy. A doctor puts a thin, bendy tube into your anus. This is pushed up your colon so
the doctor can see all the way along it.

If your doctor sees anything unusual during the test, he or she can take a sample
of tissue to look at more closely.

Just before the test, you will probably be given a medicine to make you sleepy (a
sedative). This is to make the test less uncomfortable. Colonoscopy is also used as
a follow-up test if your doctor finds any possible problems during one of the other
screening tests.



You might also be offered a test called a computed tomography colography. This test uses a computer to put together scans to build up a picture of the inside
of your bowel. It is also sometimes called a virtual colonoscopy.

For a colonoscopy or a virtual colonoscopy, you'll need to empty your whole bowel
before the test. So you'll take a laxative the day before, and you won't be able to
eat or drink anything on the day of the test.

You also can't eat solid food for a while before a colonoscopy - your doctor will
give you detailed instructions.

If you have a flexible sigmoidoscopy, only the lower part of your bowel needs to be
emptied. You may have a laxative before the test, or have an enema, which involves
washing out the lower part of your bowel with water through a tube.

Should I be screened?
The age when people start screening for bowel cancer varies from country to country.
In England, for example, men and women aged 60 to 74 are invited to have screening
with a faecal occult blood test (FOBT) every two years. They are also invited to have
a one-time flexible sigmoidoscopy at age 55.

These screening programmes are for people who have an average risk of getting bowel
cancer. This means they have no health problems or family history that puts them at
higher risk of this cancer.

People who have a raised risk of bowel cancer can get tested earlier and more often.
Things that increase your risk of bowel cancer include:



having had previous polyps or bowel cancer. Bowel cancer usually starts in small growths
called polyps. Adenomatous polyps are a type that is particularly likely to develop
into cancer.

If you've had adenomatous polyps removed from your bowel in the past, or you've had
bowel cancer before, you'll need more frequent screening.



a family history of bowel cancer. This means that a close relative (a parent, child,
brother, or sister) had bowel cancer or adenomatous polyps before age 60, or two close
relatives had bowel cancer at any age.



having ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. These are long-term diseases that cause
inflammation (swelling and irritation) inside the bowel. This increases your risk
of bowel cancer.



having an inherited condition that increases the chance of bowel cancer. These include
familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), Lynch syndrome, and MYH-associated polyposis
(MAP).

These are rare diseases that run in families. If your doctor suspects you may have
one of these conditions, you can have genetic testing to find out for certain.



What will happen after my test?
If you have a negative result
A negative result means the test did not find any signs of cancer. This is reassuring.
But remember that no test is 100 percent accurate.

You should still see your doctor if you have any symptoms that could mean bowel cancer.
These include:



a change in your bowel habits that lasts for several weeks. This could be loose stools
and needing to go to the toilet more often, or bad constipation



repeated bleeding from your anus


visible blood in your stools


bad pain in your abdomen.


If you have a positive result
A positive result can make you feel anxious. But a positive result with most screening
tests doesn't mean you definitely have cancer. A colonoscopy is the only test that
can tell you for certain whether you have bowel cancer.

You'll be sent for a colonoscopy if you get a positive result from any of the other
screening tests. Colonoscopy is a very thorough test for bowel cancer, because it
can see the full length of the colon and rectum.

If the colonoscopy finds any polyps, these can be removed during the colonoscopy.
If the colonoscopy finds any abnormal-looking areas in the bowel, the doctor will
also remove a small piece of tissue during the test. Doctors call this taking a biopsy.

Any removed tissue or polyps are then examined for cancer cells.
If cancer cells are found, you will be referred to a doctor who specialises in bowel
cancer. The doctor will need to do some further tests to plan the best treatment for
you.

The main treatments for bowel cancer are surgery, radiotherapy, and treatment with
anticancer drugs (chemotherapy). To learn more, see our leaflets Bowel cancer: what is it? and Bowel cancer: what treatments work?

Bladder cancer happens when one or more tumours form in the bladder. If a tumour spreads
into other tissues or organs it becomes harder to treat. But most bladder cancers
are confined to the bladder.

You can use our information to talk to your doctor about what treatments are best
for you.

What is bladder cancer?
The cells that make up the organs in our body usually grow, die off, and replace themselves
in a regular and controlled way. But when cells grow out of control, they can form
clumps called tumours. This is cancer.

Tumours can sometimes grow in the lining of the bladder. And these tumours can sometimes
spread into nearby muscle, into glands called lymph nodes, and into other organs.

Bladder cancer can involve more than one tumour. The more a tumour spreads, the harder
it is to treat.



If bladder cancer is confined inside the lining of the bladder, it’s called non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer. This is the most common type of bladder cancer, and the easiest to
treat.



If bladder cancer spreads into the surrounding bladder muscle it’s called muscle-invasive bladder cancer.



If bladder cancer spreads to other parts of the body it’s called metastatic bladder cancer. This is the hardest type to treat.



The most common cause of bladder cancer is smoking. This is because the bladder is
where harmful substances that we consume or breathe in often collect before we flush
them out when we urinate.

Some of these harmful chemicals can cause cancer. They are called carcinogens. Tobacco
smoke contains many of these carcinogens.

Other chemicals that can cause bladder cancer include:


carcinogens in diesel fumes, and


carcinogens in industrial chemicals in things like dyes, paints, and plastics.


But factory workers tend to work in safer conditions than they once did, so these
chemicals shouldn’t be so much of a problem as they once were.

Other things that make someone more likely to get bladder cancer include:


being a man. Bladder cancer is more common in men than in women. This is possibly
because, in the past, men were more likely to work in factories and come into contact
with dangerous chemicals



being older


having had cancer treatment before


having had regular bladder problems before, such as repeated urinary tract infections
(UTIs).



If you have bladder cancer your specialist cancer doctor (called an oncologist) will
assess it using something called a TNM classification. This helps doctors understand what kind of treatments you might need.



The T stands for tumour. It refers to how far into the bladder tissue the tumour has
grown.



The N stands for nodes. This refers to whether the cancer has spread into nearby glands
called lymph nodes.



The M stands for metastasis. This refers to whether the cancer has spread (or ‘metastasised’)
into other parts of the body.



Your oncologist will give each of these letters a score based on how far and where
your cancer has spread. It’s a complicated system and can be hard to understand. Your
doctor should explain your TNM score to you carefully.

What are the symptoms?
The main symptom of bladder cancer is blood in your urine. Your doctor might call
this haematuria.

Sometimes it’s obvious if there is blood in your urine, as you can see that your urine
is a brownish colour. But often there is only a little blood. So it’s not always noticeable.

If you notice blood in your urine, see your doctor, even if the problem stops, and
even if it only happens once. Just because the bleeding stops doesn’t mean the problem
has gone away.

Other symptoms of bladder cancer include:


pain when urinating. This is called dysuria. But this doesn’t happen to everyone with
bladder cancer, and it’s more likely to be a symptom of other conditions such as cystitis
(a urinary tract infection)



needing to urinate more than usual. This is less common, and it’s not usually the
only symptom of bladder cancer. It’s also more likely to be caused by something other
than bladder cancer. For example, in men it’s more likely to be a sign of prostate
problems, or of the normal enlarging of the prostate that happens as you get older.
But it’s best to tell your doctor if your urination habits change.



If your doctor thinks that you might have bladder cancer or another problem with your
urinary tract, you will need some tests.

You might need to give a urine sample, so that it can be tested for blood.
If this suggests that you might have bladder cancer, you will need another test, called
a cystoscopy. With this test, a thin tube is inserted into the urethra (the tube that carries
urine from the bladder out of your body). On the end of this tube is a tiny camera,
which looks for tumours in the bladder.

You might also have other scans, such as CT or ultrasound.
If the cystoscopy finds anything unusual, your doctor will probably want to do a procedure
called a transurethral resection of a bladder tumour, or TURBT for short. TURBT is another type of test, but it can also be a treatment for early-stage
tumours.

TURBT is not a major operation, and it is done using the same method as a cystoscopy.
But you will still need a general anaesthetic.

The surgeon will remove any tumours or abnormal tissue in the bladder for testing.
If you have a tumour that is at an early stage and has not spread to the muscle around
the bladder, it will probably be the only surgery that you need.

What treatments work?
The treatment you are offered will depend on how far your cancer has spread.
Non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer
This is the most common type of bladder cancer. For this type of cancer you might
only need TURBT followed by a single dose of chemotherapy.

Chemotherapy drugs are medications that destroy cancer cells. The chemotherapy medication
is given directly into the bladder. Then it is drained out after an hour or so.

If your doctor thinks there is a chance that your cancer might spread, you might need
more chemotherapy. The usual treatment is six more sessions of chemotherapy given
into the bladder. Your doctor will explain to you when and how these treatments will
happen.

Chemotherapy for bladder cancer can cause unpleasant side effects, including pain
when you urinate, and feeling generally unwell - as if you have flu. Your doctor should
discuss these side effects with you and explain how the chemotherapy might make you
feel.

In some people, the cancer returns soon after they have TURBT. If this happens to
you, you might need to have TURBT a second time.

Some people with non-muscle-invasive cancer need an operation to remove the bladder
completely. But this is rare.

The operation to remove the bladder is called a cystectomy. In men, the prostate is removed at the same time, because cancer cells can spread
easily to the prostate.

Cystectomy is a major operation, and it will change the way that urine leaves your
body. It’s natural to be anxious about an operation like this. But your doctor should
discuss it with you in detail and explain what will happen. And you should ask any
questions that you want to, at any stage of your treatment.

Muscle-invasive bladder cancer
This type of bladder cancer, which has spread outside the muscle around the bladder,
is sometimes also called locally invasive cancer. The treatment depends on how far the cancer has spread, and it is different
depending on whether you are a man or a woman.



The usual treatment in men is surgery to remove the bladder and the prostate.


Women usually need a cystectomy to remove the bladder, and sometimes a hysterectomy,
which is an operation to remove the womb (uterus).



Some people who only have one tumour might be able to have just part of the bladder
removed.



It’s not possible to get pregnant after having a hysterectomy. Whatever kind of surgery
you have, your doctor should discuss it with you in detail.

If you have your bladder removed, the surgeon will also create a new way for urine
to leave the body. This can be done in several ways. You can discuss with your doctor
which method will work best for you.



A new bladder can sometimes be made using part of your bowel. This should let you
urinate fairly normally.



A reservoir can be made from part of your bowel, to store urine before it passes out
through a catheter.



A tube or ‘ileal conduit’ can be made from part of your bowel. This tube carries urine
out of the body either through your urethra or a catheter.



If you have either an ileal conduit or reservoir made, you will need to wear a special
bag that collects urine as it passes from the body. You then drain the bag whenever
you need to.

If you have surgery to remove your bladder you will also need to have chemotherapy.
And your doctor might also recommend another drug treatment, called immunotherapy. This treatment involves giving you drugs that help your body fight cancer by boosting
your immune system.

Some people with muscle-invasive bladder cancer might not be able to have surgery.
This might be because:



their cancer has spread too far for the operation to be successful


their general health is poor and they are not strong enough to have major surgery,
or



their age means that they might not be strong enough to have major surgery.


The usual treatment for these people is chemotherapy, and possibly also radiotherapy. Radiotherapy uses targeted radiation to kill cancer cells. These treatments won’t
cure the cancer. But they can help you to live longer. Your doctor should discuss
all possible treatments and outcomes with you.

Sometimes, though, chemotherapy shrinks a tumour enough that cystectomy to remove
the bladder becomes possible.

Metastatic bladder cancer
If you have metastatic bladder cancer it means that your cancer has spread beyond
the bladder into other organs, such as the liver, lungs, or bones.

Radiotherapy and chemotherapy can be used to ease symptoms and make you feel more
comfortable. Immunotherapy is sometimes also used. But in most people these treatments
don’t lead to a cure.

Some people respond very well to radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and they are then
able to have surgery. This can happen if you only had one tumour in your bladder to
begin with, and if your cancer has only spread to one place where it’s not too hard
to remove.

What will happen?
If you have had treatment for bladder cancer you will need regular check-ups, possibly
as often as every few months, for the rest of your life, to check that the cancer
hasn’t come back.

It is quite common for bladder cancer to come back months or years after you have
treatment. If this happens, you will need more treatment.

Most people with bladder cancer have the non-muscle-invasive type that can be treated
and cured, even if it comes back. Most people with this type of cancer don’t die from
it.

The outlook is less good for muscle-invasive cancer. About half of people with this
type of bladder cancer will die from it, even if they have surgery. And only about
10 in 100 people with metastatic bladder cancer are cured."

Most of us have ups and downs in our moods. But if you have bipolar disorder your
mood swings are much more extreme. Bipolar disorder is a long-term mental health condition.
It can make life hard, but treatment can help you keep your symptoms under control.


This leaflet tells you about the medicines you might need to take for bipolar disorder.
You can use our information to talk to your doctor and family, and to plan your treatment.

How is bipolar disorder treated?
If you have bipolar disorder your mood swings much further than is usual in most people.
Sometimes you might feel very high and have lots of energy. That is called mania. Other times, you might feel very low. That is called depression.

Most people with bipolar disorder need to take medicines every day to keep their mood
stable. The type of medicine and the dose you take might change, depending on how
well you are and what symptoms you are getting.

All the medicines used for bipolar disorder can cause unwanted side effects. But some
medicines might suit you better than others. It can take a while for you and your
doctor to find the right medicine, or combination of medicines, for you.

As you are reading about the side effects, bear in mind that you won’t get them all.
It’s really important not to stop taking your medicines without talking to your doctor
first, even if you get side effects.

If you stop, you might have a relapse of mania or depression. Your doctor might be
able to adjust your dose or switch you to another type of medicine.

Medicines to treat and prevent mania
If you are having a bout of mania you might be racing around, having big ideas, taking
lots of risks. You'll need treatment that will calm your mood quickly.

There are three main types of medicine used to treat mania. You might need to take
more than one type to bring your mania under control and prevent a relapse.

Antipsychotics are medicines that calm down the activity in your brain. This should bring your mania
under control and help you feel calmer. These medicines are sometimes used over the
long term, to help prevent a relapse.

You might also need to take mood stabilisers. They help prevent mood swings. Mood stabilisers are usually taken over the long
term, to help prevent a relapse.

Side effects of mania medicines
The lists of side effects for bipolar medications can look long and worrying. But
remember, they don't happen to everyone, and you won't get all of them. Some people
have very few problems.

But if you do have side effects that bother you, talk to your doctor. You might be
able to change to a different drug or a different dose.

Antipsychotics can sometimes cause high blood sugar and diabetes. You should have regular checks
to avoid these problems.

Antipsychotics can also cause muscle stiffness and shaking. These side effects are
sometimes called parkinsonism, because they can look a bit like Parkinson’s disease.

Other common side effects can include:


drowsiness


weight gain


dry mouth


headache


constipation


dizziness, and


trouble sleeping.


Mood stabilisers can cause side effects such as:



tiredness or drowsiness


shaking and dizziness


problems concentrating


hair loss


thirst


thyroid problems


clumsiness


rash, and


eyesight problems.


You need to be careful not to take too much of any of these medicines, because it
can be dangerous. This is especially true of a drug called lithium. If you take lithium you’ll have regular blood tests to make sure you’re not taking
too much.

The mood stabiliser valproate can cause serious birth defects and other problems in babies and children. So it
is not prescribed for pregnant women. And it is not prescribed for women and girls
of childbearing age unless:



no other treatments work, or all other treatments cause serious side effects, and


the patient is using reliable contraception (you might hear your doctor talk about
a 'pregnancy prevention programme').



Medicines to treat depression
Some of the same medicines used to treat mania can also help with depression in bipolar
disorder. These include some antipsychotics and mood stabilisers.

Antidepressants are also sometimes used, but they are usually prescribed along with an antipsychotic,
a mood stabiliser, or both. This is because taking an antidepressant alone for bipolar
disorder can sometimes trigger a bout of mania.

Side effects of medicines for depression
Antidepressants can cause stomach upsets, trouble sleeping, and anxiety.
However, the main concern about using antidepressants to treat depression in bipolar
disorder is that they can trigger a mood swing that turns into mania. It’s not clear
how likely this is."

Most of us have ups and downs in our moods. But if you have bipolar disorder, your
mood swings are much more extreme and disrupt your daily life. With the right treatments,
most people can control their extreme high and low moods.
What happens in bipolar disorder?
Bipolar disorder is a long-term mental health problem. If you have this disorder,
your mood swings much further than other people's. Sometimes, you may feel very high
and have lots of energy. That is called mania. Other times, you may feel very low. That is called depression.

Both bipolar mania and depression can make it hard to live a normal life. You may
find it difficult to hold down a job, for example, or to attend college or university
regularly.

And mania and depression can put a big strain on your relationships. But in between
the mania and the depression, you may have times when you're in a normal, stable mood.
That stable mood can last for weeks, months, or even years.

Bipolar disorder is also called manic depression and bipolar affective disorder.

There are two main types of bipolar disorder. They are called bipolar I and bipolar
II.



Bipolar I means you get bouts of mania and bouts of depression.



Bipolar II also means you get bouts of mania and bouts of depression. But the mania is milder.
It is sometimes called hypomania. Bipolar II is slightly more common than bipolar
I.



Ask your doctor: what type of bipolar disorder do I have?
Why has it happened to me?
Doctors don’t know exactly what causes bipolar disorder. It may be to do with your
levels of certain 'chemical messengers' that carry signals between different parts
of your brain.

Bipolar disorder seems to be linked to your genes, although not everyone who has relatives
with bipolar disorder gets it themselves. Also, some people get bipolar disorder without
having a family history of the illness.

For some people, certain experiences seem to bring on the first symptoms of bipolar
disorder. Or, if you already have bipolar disorder, some experiences may trigger another
bout (a relapse). These include:



stressful situations


using drugs recreationally, and


having a baby (if you're a woman).


Ask your doctor: what’s the most likely reason for my bipolar disorder?
What are the symptoms?
The main symptoms of bipolar disorder are periods of mania and depression.
Mania can feel good when it starts. You may:



feel very creative


have lots of energy


feel very happy, and


get excited about new hobbies and interests.


But this high mood gets out of control. You may turn aggressive and do harmful things.
Mania can make you restless and irritable, with racing thoughts. You may:


speak very fast


not sleep


make impulsive decisions, and


act in a way that is unusual for you. For example, you may go on a spending spree,
or have sex with lots of people, when this is not how you normally behave.



Some people have mania that is less severe than this. If you have mild mania (hypomania),
you may speak quickly, be restless, and jump from one activity to another. But you'll
be less out of control than if you had more severe mania.

A bout of mania can start suddenly. If you get full-blown mania and you don't have
treatment, it will probably last for at least a week and it could last for several
months. Hypomania, by definition, lasts for between four and seven days.

The symptoms of depression in bipolar disorder are like the ones of depression in people who don't get mania.
You may:



feel sad, hopeless, or guilty


lose interest or pleasure in things you normally enjoy, and


have no energy.


Some people even think about killing themselves.
A bout of depression usually lasts for at least two weeks, but it can go on for several
months.

Ask your doctor: what symptoms can I expect from bipolar disorder?
What will happen to me?
Most people with bipolar disorder take medicines long term to keep their mood stable.
The type of medicine and the dose you take may change, depending on how well you are
and what symptoms you are getting.

Most of the time you can keep your symptoms under control by taking medicine. But
most people find their symptoms eventually come back (a relapse). It may happen because
they stop taking their medicines. Or it may be because the medicines don't work well
enough.

Between bouts of mania and depression, you may not have any symptoms, or you may have
low-level symptoms, such as a low mood. With support from your doctor and healthcare
team, you may be able to lead a normal life.

Ask your doctor: how can I best keep my symptoms under control?

bipolar disorder and how you can prevent a relapse."

If you have been told you have bipolar disorder you may want to talk to your doctor
to find out more.

Here are some questions that you might want to ask.


Do I have bipolar disorder type 1 or type 2?


What are my options for treatment while I have mania?


What are my options for treatment while I have bipolar depression?


Can I learn how to tell when my symptoms are coming back (that is, when I am having
a relapse)?



What should I do if I spot the signs of a relapse? Who should I contact? Which medicines
should I take?



While I'm well, can we work out what treatment I want if I have a relapse?


Will I need to keep taking my treatment even if I'm feeling fine?


Are there any things I should do, or not do, that may stop me getting a relapse?


What should I do if I start thinking about hurting or killing myself?


How can my friends and family help me cope with my bipolar disorder?


Are there any local support groups in my area, or online support groups, for people
with bipolar disorder?"

Most of us have ups and downs in our moods. But if you have bipolar disorder, your
mood swings are much more extreme. Bipolar disorder can make life hard. But with the
right treatments, most people can control their very high and low moods.
How can I keep myself well?
If you have bipolar disorder, your mood swings much further than other people's. Sometimes,
you might feel very high and have lots of energy. That is called mania. Other times, you might feel very low. That is called depression.

When you are well and your mood is stable, you'll want to stay that way as long as
possible. If your symptoms of mania or depression come back, doctors say you have
had a relapse.

The most common reason for a relapse is not taking your medicine. For example, you
may have been feeling well and decided you didn’t want to take the medicine any more.
Or you may be fed up with side effects. But if you stop suddenly, you are much more
likely to have a relapse.

It’s best to discuss changing your medicine with your doctor before you stop taking
it. Your doctor may be able to prescribe a lower dose, or switch you to another medicine
with fewer side effects.

Relapses can also be triggered by things that happen in your life, such as:


stressful situations like exams, and problems in relationships or at work


sleeping too little or too much


taking recreational drugs or drinking too much alcohol.


Some people just find it hard to remember to take their medication. Things like special
pill boxes divided into sections for each day, and reminders on your calendars, can
help. Different things work for different people. For example, it may be that a specific
family member helps you to remember your medicine.

Having a talking treatment called cognitive therapy can help you make helpful changes to your life, such as learning to cope with stress.
This can help you avoid a relapse and get on with your life in a more stable way.

A talking treatment called interpersonal social rhythm therapy can also help. It focuses on helping you:



identify and keep up the regular routines of your everyday life (including your sleep),
and



solve issues and problems that happen when you interact with other people, which can
affect these routines.



How can I learn to spot the signs of a relapse?
You can reduce your chance of relapses if you learn to spot the warning signs.
Early signs of a relapse can be different for everyone. For example, you might notice
you need less sleep when you are getting a relapse of mania.

You can work out your own warning signs by having training with a psychologist. If
you know the warning signs, you can take action to avoid a full-blown relapse. The
psychologist can help you decide what to do when you feel a relapse coming on.

How can friends and family help?
Having a supportive family and friends can help a lot. But caring for someone with
bipolar disorder isn't easy. This illness can put a strain on relationships, because
it’s hard to see someone you care about when they're very depressed or when they're
behaving in a way they will regret.

It might help your friends and family to find out more about bipolar disorder. Many
people with bipolar disorder say they have trouble explaining how they feel, especially
when they are depressed. This can make them feel very lonely. And the people who care
for them often feel rejected, because it’s so hard to communicate.

Reading about bipolar disorder, or contacting a self-help group, can help your family
understand your condition better. You might also ask your doctor about family therapy.

In family therapy, you and your family learn about bipolar disorder. You all get training
on how to spot early signs of a relapse and what to do about it. And you may have
training to help you all get better at communicating and solving problems together.

Planning ahead
If you do have a relapse of symptoms, you may not be able to think clearly about what
sort of care you need.

While you are well, talk to your doctor about the sort of care you want if you have
a relapse. This could include:



which doctor or nurse you or your family can call, 24 hours a day, if you think you
are having a relapse



who should be told about your condition


where you want to go for treatment, if you need care in a hospital or a clinic


which medicines you want to be given.


You could also write down what you want done about important things you can’t manage
yourself while you are unwell, like looking after your children, house, or pets.

This plan is sometimes called an advance directive. Your doctor can help you draw it up. It can be kept with your medical records. You
might want to carry a copy with you, or share it with family or friends.

You’ll know what is going to happen if you get unwell. And your family may find it
comforting to know what you want them to do.

Where to get more help
There are organisations and charities that provide advice and support to people with
bipolar disorder, and their friends and family. You can ask your doctor or nurse for
recommendations, or look online. For example, in the UK, one organisation is Bipolar
UK (bipolaruk.org.uk)."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/3000282/Benzodiazepine%20overdose,Benzodiazepine overdose,"Benzodiazepine overdose Last published: Aug 18, 2022
Benzodiazepine medicines are often prescribed for conditions including insomnia and
anxiety. An overdose happens when someone takes too much in a short period.

This can happen by accident or as a suicide attempt. Most people recover well with
treatment, but a large overdose can sometimes lead to serious problems and even death.

If you are concerned about the dangers of benzodiazepines, either for you or someone
else, you can use our information to talk to your doctor.

What is benzodiazepine overdose?
Benzodiazepines help to calm and 'slow down' the body’s nervous system. They are often
broadly known as 'sleeping tablets' or 'tranquilisers'. But they are prescribed for
many conditions, including :



Insomnia


Anxiety


Seizures


Panic disorder, which causes panic attacks, and


Conditions that involve muscle spasms.


Benzodiazepines are also often prescribed for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),
even though the evidence suggests that they don’t work for this condition.

They are also commonly abused as recreational drugs, often alongside alcohol or opioids.
Benzodiazepines are controversial. Doctors know that they can cause problems such
as addiction, and dizziness, which can lead to falls. But they are still widely prescribed, possibly
because sometimes there doesn’t seem to be a good alternative.

For most people, benzodiazepines should only be prescribed for short periods. But many people end up taking them for much longer.

An overdose can happen:



Accidentally, when someone takes too high a dose in a short time, or if they are given
too high a dose in hospital



As an act of self-harm, such as a suicide attempt, or


If someone (usually an older person) has liver problems, and their liver can’t cope
with even a normal dose of the drug.



What are the symptoms?
The main symptom of a benzodiazepine overdose is what doctors call excessive sedation. This means that someone becomes extremely drowsy. Other symptoms include:



Slurred speech


Poor coordination


Being unsteady on your feet, and


Struggling to pay attention or to remember things.


A large overdose can cause much more serious problems, such as coma, and breathing problems. Without treatment, this can lead to death.

What treatments are available?
Most people who have a benzodiazepine overdose don’t need any specific treatment,
other than being watched in hospital until the effects of the drug wear off, to make
sure their symptoms don’t get worse.

If you have severe symptoms, such as being in a coma, or you aren’t breathing properly, you will need extra help
to deal with those problems.

Some people are given charcoal tablets to swallow. Charcoal absorbs drugs in your stomach and intestine, so that
they don’t get into your system. But they only work if you take them within about
an hour of having an overdose.

Most people can be discharged within a few hours of an overdose. But if your overdose
was a deliberate act of self-harm, you will need to stay in hospital until a psychiatrist
or psychologist can see you.

They will talk with you, and assess if you might be likely to harm yourself again.
If they think that you might, then you might have to stay in hospital until your doctor
thinks it’s safe for you to leave.

What to expect in the future
If, after being treated for an accidental overdose, you still need to take benzodiazepines
for medical reasons, your doctor should recommend that you take a different one from
the one that led to the overdose.

There are several benzodiazepines, so there are several others that you can try, to
try to avoid problems.

If your doctor thinks that you shouldn’t be taking benzodiazepines any more, they
might recommend that you slowly reduce your dose until you stop taking them completely.

You can talk to your regular doctor about how to do this, and about what you might
be able to take instead.

Most people recover well after an overdose of these drugs. But if you took a deliberate
overdose, dealing with the issues that led to it could take time. And you might need
a lot of help.

If you have become dependent on benzodiazepines, your doctor should also talk with
you about getting help to stop taking them.

Doctors know that it can be hard to stop taking these drugs. So they should be understanding
about the difficulties you might face."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/3000277/Benign%20paroxysmal%20positional%20vertigo,Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo,"Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo Last published: Jun 09, 2022
If you have benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) you get sudden dizzy spells
that can make you feel nauseous (sick) and unsteady on your feet.

These dizzy spells go away by themselves after a while, and they’re not a sign of
a more serious problem. But if you keep having them there are treatments that can
help prevent them.

You can use our information to talk to your doctor about the best treatments for you.
What is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo?
Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is usually called BPPV for short, or just vertigo. The word vertigo means dizziness, a feeling that everything around you is spinning.

Note: despite how the word is sometimes used, vertigo has nothing to do with the fear
of heights: the correct name for fear of heights is acrophobia, not vertigo.

The confusion happens because looking down from a great height can sometimes cause
dizziness.

If you have BPPV, you get sudden spells of dizziness that can last from a few seconds
to several hours.

Episodes of BPPV are brought on by sudden head movements, or when you change the position
of your head after a long time: for example, when you get up in the morning or turn
over quickly in bed.

This is because tiny particles of material in your inner ear can affect your balance
if they get into the wrong part of your ear.

This dizziness can be severe, and can make you feel unsteady. For example, you might
find it hard to walk in a straight line. You might also feel nauseous (sick) and feel
as though you need to lie down.

These dizzy spells go away by themselves and don’t usually cause any problems. But
if they happen a lot or last a long time they can disrupt your life and make it hard
to go about your normal activities.

BPPV is more common in middle-aged and older people, but it can happen at any age,
especially if there is a clear cause. Several things can cause BPPV, but in most people
we simply don’t know why it happens.

Causes of repeated episodes of vertigo include:


head injuries


migraines


having had surgery in an ear, and


conditions that affect the ears and balance, such as labyrinthitis and Meniere’s disease.
For more information on these conditions, see our leaflets: Labyrinthitis and Meniere’s disease.



What are the symptoms?
The symptoms of BPPV include:


sudden dizziness that’s usually brought on by a sudden head movement


nausea


feeling unsteady, and


feeling light headed.


Several conditions can have dizziness as a symptom. But there are things that suggest
that someone has BPPV rather than another problem. For example, if you have BPPV:



the symptoms come on suddenly rather than building up over time


the dizziness that happens with people who have BPPV usually lasts for less than 30
seconds



but other symptoms such as poor balance, nausea, and being light headed can last for
much longer.



There are some tests that doctors can use to tell if you probably have BPPV. One of these is called the
Dix-Hallpike manoeuvre.

This is a physical test. To do it, your doctor moves your head and upper body in certain
ways, and watches what happens to your eyes.

If your eyes 'jump' when the doctor moves your head in certain directions, then you
probably have BPPV.

Your doctor will also ask you questions about things that might make you more likely
to have BPPV, such as whether you:



have had an infection recently, especially a throat or chest infection


have had a head injury in the past


ever get migraines, and


have ever had problems with your ears.


What treatments are available?
Repositioning manoeuvres
Many people don’t need any treatment for BPPV, as they stop having episodes of vertigo
after a few weeks. BPPV isn’t a sign of a more serious condition, and it doesn’t lead
to any other problems if not treated.

But it can be distressing and can affect your quality of life if it happens a lot.
So, if your symptoms keep happening, there are things your doctor can do to help.
The main treatment for BPPV is called a particle repositioning manoeuvre or an Epley manouevre.

This treatment is done to move tiny particles away from parts of the ear where they
affect your balance and cause dizziness.

To do this manoeuvre:


you lie down


your doctor gently moves your head into various positions: for example, you will face
from side to side and downwards



you keep your head still in each position for a short while.


Having this procedure can bring on dizziness. But when it is finished, you should
no longer have BPPV.

You should have a follow-up appointment a few weeks after you have this manoeuvre.
Your doctor might test you using the Dix-Hallpike manoeuvre that they might have used
to diagnose your BPPV in the first place.

Your test might suggest that you don’t need further treatment. Or you might need to
have another repositioning manoeuvre.

Other treatments
Repositioning manoeuvres aren’t suitable for everyone. For example:


they don’t work for some people


they aren’t advisable for people with certain conditions, including severe heart disease,
and problems with the spine, neck, or hips, and



they make some people feel so dizzy or nauseous that they can’t complete them.


If you can’t have repositioning manoeuvres, your doctor might be able to refer you
to a specialist clinic for dizziness. This isn’t as unusual as it might sound, as there are several conditions
that can affect people’s balance.

The specialist will show you how to do exercises that can help reduce your dizziness.
These exercises take time to learn and to do at home regularly. But many people find
them helpful.

If other treatments don’t work, your doctor might suggest surgery, but most people don’t need it. Less than 1 in 100 people with BPPV need surgery.

Surgery for BPPV usually works well. But, as with all operations, there are risks.
For example, about 4 in every 100 people who have this operation are left with some
permanent hearing loss.

Your doctor should discuss all the possible pros and cons of surgery with you.
What to expect in the future
BPPV usually goes away by itself after a few weeks and doesn’t happen again. So most
people never need treatment.

But if it does keep happening, talk to your doctor. One simple manoeuvre could solve
the problem.

It’s especially important to talk to your doctor if you’re older and not as steady
on your feet as you used to be, as BPPV could lead to a fall.

You should also be aware of the chance of having an episode of BPPV while you are
driving a vehicle or riding a bicycle. If turning your head suddenly causes you dizziness
in these situations, you should see your doctor.

BPPV can come back or keep happening over many years. If it’s not severe and the episodes
don’t last long, you might decide it’s not worth worrying about.

But if it bothers you or affects your quality of life, you might want to seek more
help. For example, your doctor or a specialist might be able to show you repositioning
exercises that you can do at home."

If you wake up one morning and find that your face droops on one side, you may have
Bell's palsy. This can be alarming, but most people recover completely.
We've looked at the best and most up-to-date research to produce this information.
You can use it to talk to your doctor and decide which treatments are right for you.

What happens?
If you have Bell's palsy the muscles of your face suddenly become weak. It happens
because a nerve sending messages from your brain to your face muscles stops working.
It almost always happens on just one side of the face.

We don't know for certain what causes Bell's palsy. It may be caused by swelling around
the nerve, caused by a virus.

Not everyone who has weak face muscles has Bell's palsy. Some people with similar
symptoms have another condition, such as an injury, an ear disease, or a stroke.

Your doctor will check for other conditions. You won't be diagnosed with Bell's palsy
until other problems have been ruled out. You might need some tests, such as an MRI
scan or a CT scan, to rule out problems other than Bell's palsy.

Some people who have a stroke get weakness in the muscles of the face, but this is
different from Bell's palsy. If you have a stroke, other parts of your body are usually
affected, too.

What are the symptoms?
You might find that your face droops on one side and it's hard to close or open one
eye. You may not be able to frown or smile properly and your speech may be slurred.
Having less control over your mouth muscles might mean that you dribble saliva.

Some people get an ache behind their ear for a few days. Bell's palsy isn't usually
painful, but you may find loud noises unpleasant. You may lose your sense of taste
on the affected side of your tongue.

These things might make you feel anxious or self-conscious.
The symptoms come on quickly. They might get worse over two to three days.
Bell's palsy only affects the face. If you feel weak or numb in other parts of your
body you should tell your doctor immediately.

What treatments work?
Most people recover from Bell's palsy within about six months, even without treatment.
But treatment can help relieve the symptoms and help you recover more quickly.

Medicines
The main treatment for Bell's palsy is steroid tablets. These work by reducing the
inflammation (swelling) around the affected nerve. They seem to work best if you take
them within three days of your symptoms starting. You'll probably need to take the
tablets for a week.

The full name for these medicines is corticosteroids. These are not the same as the anabolic steroids used by some bodybuilders. They
are similar to natural chemicals made in your body that reduce inflammation.

Taking steroids for a long time at a high dose can cause side effects, including high
blood pressure, diabetes, and thinning of the bones. But the short courses of steroids
used to treat Bell's palsy are unlikely to cause these problems.

Doctors sometimes prescribe antiviral tablets alongside steroids. Antiviral tablets attack the virus that may be causing the problem.
Antiviral drugs might help when used together with steroids, but they don't help when
used on their own.

Antiviral medicines can have mild side effects. Some people feel sick and get diarrhoea.


Surgery
Surgery for Bell's palsy can help people to recover completely. But it is a complex
operation that is only used for people with severe symptoms. For example, your doctor
won't usually suggest surgery unless you have no movement at all on the affected side
of your face, and if tests show that your facial muscles are badly affected.

Surgery involves removing part of the bone in the face as well as some other tissue.
This gives the affected nerve room to swell so that other tissues are not pressing
on it.

Eye protection
Many people with Bell's palsy find that they can't properly close the eye on the side
of the face that is affected. This means that there is a danger the eye could become
too dry. This can cause permanent damage.

There are several things you can do to avoid problems.


Wear glasses or sunglasses during the day to protect the eye.


Use eye drops called artificial tears to keep the eye moist. Use them as often as
you need to.



Your doctor may advise you to tape the eye closed at night while you sleep. He or
she may also suggest an eye-lubrication ointment or gel to use while you sleep.



You may need to a have a small weight fitted into your eyelid to keep it closed. This
is temporary and the weight will be removed when you have recovered.



What will happen to me?
Very few people get Bell's palsy more than once. So if you get what seems like a second
episode, see your doctor.

You have a good chance of recovering completely from Bell's palsy. This means that
you will regain all or most of the muscle control in your face. About 3 in 10 people
are left with some muscle weakness.

About 2 in 10 people also get other long-term problems; for example, your face may
look different because your face muscles have shortened. And parts of your face may
move differently; for example, your chin may dimple when you blink. That happens when
the nerve in the face grows back in a different way.

These problems can be distressing. You can talk to your doctor about further treatments.
You may also find counselling helps you cope with changes to your face.

You're more likely to have long-term problems if:


You have no movement at all in the affected side of your face


You are older than 60


You have high blood pressure or diabetes, or you're pregnant


You haven't started to recover after six weeks.


Where to get more help
You might want to talk to other people who have Bell's palsy. There are various charities
and support groups. For example, in the UK, the Bell's Palsy Association (bellspalsy.org.uk)
is a charity that may be able to help."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1566167669932/Bedwetting,Bedwetting,"Bedwetting Last published: Oct 11, 2021
Lots of children wet the bed. Most grow out of it without any problems. But if your
child is upset about wetting the bed, or if you're worried about your child, there
are things you can do to help.
We've brought together the best and most up-to-date research about bedwetting to see
what treatments work. You can use our information to talk to your doctor and decide
which treatments are best for your child.

When is bedwetting a problem?
It's common for young children to wet the bed. It's often a normal part of growing
up. In fact it's so common that doctors don't recommend any treatment in children
under the age of 7 years old. The medical name for bedwetting (for people of any age)
is 'nocturnal enuresis'.

If your child starts wetting the bed when you take them out of nappies, just try again
a few months later. Lots of children still need nappies at night when they start school.

Bedwetting isn't serious. But it can make children feel embarrassed or upset, especially
if they're older or they get teased about it.

It's important to make sure that children aren't teased, blamed, or embarrassed at
home if they wet the bed. It's also vital to encourage and praise them when they make
progress.

What treatments work?
Most children stop wetting the bed in their own time. About 15 in 100 children who
wet the bed will stop each year without any treatment. This means that nearly all
children will eventually stop by themselves. But there are treatments that can help
some children stop sooner.

Routines and good habits
The first thing to try, and that helps for many people, involves getting your child
into good toilet habits. This means in the daytime as well as at night.



So, as well as reminding your child to go to the toilet every night before bed, you
should make sure that they feel comfortable about going to the toilet regularly when
they need to during the day. This means reminding and encouraging them, but without
pressuring them



Try not to let your child drink too much just before bed. Make sure they have enough
to drink a little earlier in the evening so that they're not thirsty at bedtime.



Do what you can to make sure your child isn't scared to get up at night if they need
to. Leaving a light on might help.



Avoid giving your child drinks that contain caffeine, such as some fizzy soft drinks,
tea, and chocolate drinks.



This kind of support and good habits should help your child learn that they can control
their bladder.

If you think you need more help you might be able to try a more formal routine, called
'bladder training', with the help of a specialist called a urotherapist.

Other conditions that might cause bedwetting
Some children have other problems or medical conditions that can lead to bedwetting.
For example, some children wet the bed because they have constipation. Dealing with
constipation reduces bedwetting in more than half of children.

Your child may be more likely to wet the bed if they have a condition that affects
their breathing. Your doctor should refer you to a specialist who should be able to
help with your child's breathing.

Bedwetting alarms
Bedwetting alarms (also called enuresis alarms) are devices that make a sound when
your child begins to wet the bed. The idea is that the child then wakes when the alarm
goes off, and then they can go to the toilet to finish urinating.

If treatment is successful, after a while the child either sleeps through the night
without wetting, or wakes in time to go to the toilet.

Research has found that these alarms are probably the treatment most likely to help
children become dry at night. More than half of children are dry after using an alarm
for about three months.

It's important to remember that, although these alarms work well, success takes time.
It could be several weeks or months before you see an improvement.

If your child is a very heavy sleeper, and might sleep through the alarm, they will
need a parent to wake them and take them to the toilet. For this treatment to work
well it's important to get them up every time the alarm sounds.

Medicines
Medicines are usually only suggested as treatments for bedwetting in children over
7 years old, and only if other treatments haven't worked. Your doctor might suggest
that you use medication and an alarm together.

A medicine called desmopressin is the one used most often. It works by making urine more concentrated, so the bladder
doesn't make as much of it.

Desmopressin can work well, but it doesn't work for all children. Also, because it
doesn't help children to learn about how to control their bladders, most children
start wetting the bed again once they stop taking it. Some families find it useful
for sleepovers or holidays, but bedwetting alarms work better in the long run.

Desmopressin can cause side effects in some children, including headaches, rash, sore
throat, or disturbed sight. Don't give your child desmopressin if they're vomiting
or have diarrhoea. And make sure they don't drink too much while they're taking it.
Very rarely, desmopressin can lead to a seizure (fit) or a coma, caused by too much
fluid in the body.

If desmopressin doesn't work for your child it's possible that they have an overactive
bladder. Your doctor might want to do more tests. There are medicines that can help
children with an overactive bladder.

Doctors used to sometimes prescribe a medicine called imipramine for children whose symptoms didn't improve with desmopressin. But it is rarely used
now, because in most children newer drugs seem to work better and with fewer side
effects. If your doctor suggests imipramine for your child they should explain why.

What will happen to my child?
Most children stop wetting the bed eventually, even without any treatment. Very rarely,
some children don't grow out of it at all, and continue to have problems with bedwetting
even as adults. This happens to about 1 in 200 people.

If you have an older child who was dry at night and who then starts to wet the bed,
it's a good idea to see your doctor. They may want to check your child for bladder
problems or for another illness."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/3000218/BCG%20vaccination,BCG vaccination,"BCG vaccination Last published:  Jun 16, 2021
BCG is a vaccination that protects against infection with tuberculosis (TB). BCG stands
for Bacillus Calmette-Guérin.

The BCG vaccine used to be part of the standard vaccination programmes in most countries.
But it is no longer routinely used in many countries, including the US.

The vaccine is still widely used in countries with high rates of TB, including those
in Africa and some Asian countries.

What is tuberculosis?
Tuberculosis is a bacterial infection that mainly damages the lungs. It is one of
the top ten causes of death worldwide.

The disease is spread from person to person in droplets of fluid when someone coughs
or sneezes.

TB doesn’t spread as easily as some diseases, such as colds and flu. To become infected,
you usually have to spend a long time in close company with someone who has TB.

The infection spreads most easily in places with cramped, overcrowded housing. Most
deaths from TB happen in Africa, the Indian subcontinent, China, and other parts of
Asia, including South-East Asia.

TB is especially dangerous in areas with high rates of HIV, as people with weakened immune systems find it harder to fight the infection.

TB can be treated with antibiotics. But the disease can be hard to cure, and some people need to take antibiotics for
many months. Even then, some strains of TB are drug resistant. This means that some antibiotics don’t work on these strains.

Symptoms of TB include:

severe coughing, which can include coughing up blood


chest pain


fever and night sweats


loss of appetite, and


weakness and fatigue.

If it is not treated, TB can affect other parts of the body, including the bones and
kidneys.

TB is not common in developed countries. But it can be present in communities:

where people have family who came from countries where TB is more common, and


where people have recently arrived from countries where there are high levels of the
disease.


Who needs the BCG vaccination?
Children at high risk
The BCG vaccine is usually given to children who are at risk of being infected with
TB.

In the US, children are usually only offered the BCG vaccine if they live with adults
who:


thave TB and who might not have been properly treated for the infection, or


have certain strains of drug resistant TB.

Young people and adults
The BCG vaccine is not usually given to people aged over 16 years, because it doesn’t
work very well in adults.

But some adults might be offered this vaccine if they are thought to have an increased
chance of getting TB.

For example, healthcare workers might be offered the vaccine if they are likely to
come into contact with people who have drug resistant TB.

If you wish to have a BCG vaccination, or if you wish your child to have it, you will
need to speak to your doctor, who will assess whether you need the vaccine.

Is there anyone who should not have the vaccine?
People who have already had TB, or who are currently infected with the disease, should
not have the vaccine. This is because:


it won’t help, and


it can cause unpleasant side effects.

This means that, before being given the vaccine, you will need to have a test called
the tuberculin skin test or Mantoux test.

This involves injecting a small amount of a substance similar to TB just under the
skin. If your skin reacts to the injection, it’s likely that you have been exposed
to TB before, and you should not have the vaccine.

If the test is negative you can have the vaccine.
Other people who should not have the BCG vaccine include:

pregnant women, and


people with a weakened immune system (this is called being immunocompromised), either
because of a medical condition, or because they are taking medication that can weaken
(suppress) the immune system.


How is the vaccination given?
The BCG vaccine is given in the same way as many other vaccines, as an injection in
the upper arm.

Is it safe?
The most common side effect of the BCG injection is a small scar at the injection
site in the upper arm.

Over several weeks after the injection you might notice a blister appear. This might
then ooze and form a crusty scab. You should leave it uncovered and allow it to heal.
If you or your child has a more severe skin reaction, tell your doctor.

Other common temporary side effects of the BCG vaccine can include:

a headache


fever, and


swollen glands.

More serious side effects include abscesses and swelling in some bones. But these
are rare.

Allergic reactions to the vaccine
Some people have an allergic reaction to the BCG vaccine. But the medical staff who
give you the vaccine will be trained in treating allergic reactions.

Even so, you should tell the medical staff before you have the vaccination if you
or your child has any allergies.

How well does the vaccine work?
The vaccine is about 70% to 80% effective against the most severe types of TB, including
TB meningitis that affects children. This means that it works for between 70 and 80
in every 100 children.

It is less effective against TB that affects the lungs, which is the most common type
of TB in adults. And it is less effective in adults in general, against all types
of TB."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/3000266/Basal%20cell%20carcinoma,Basal cell carcinoma,"Basal cell carcinoma Last published: Apr 13, 2022
Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common type of skin cancer. It doesn’t usually
spread to other tissues and it can usually be treated with simple surgery.

You can use our information to talk to your doctor about BCC. You should always see
your doctor if you think that you have symptoms of skin cancer.

What is basal cell carcinoma?
Basal cell carcinoma, or BCC for short, is the most common type of skin cancer. It’s
also less serious than some other types. It grows slowly and doesn’t usually spread
to other tissues in the way that some skin cancers can.

There are many different types of skin cancer. BCC is one of the three main types
you may have heard of. The other two are:



melanoma, which is the least common of the main types of skin cancer. Melanoma can sometimes
spread to other body tissues, which makes it harder to treat. When melanoma spreads
like this it can sometimes be fatal.



squamous cell carcinoma, which is less likely than melanoma to spread to other tissues and damage them. It
is hardly ever fatal and is usually easy to treat.



What causes BCC?
The most common cause of skin cancer is too much exposure to ultraviolet light, usually
in the form of:



frequent sun exposure, especially if you get sunburn


tanning beds, and


sun lamps.


It can be hard to know how much time in the sun is too much. For example, some sun
exposure is a good thing.

Sunlight is our main source of vitamin D, and moderate sun exposure helps to:



strengthen our bones


boost our immune systems


lower blood pressure, and


play a part in preventing many different health problems.


But this needs to be balanced against the chance of skin cancer. Broadly speaking,
the lighter your skin, the more cautious you should be about spending time in the
sun.

If you have very pale skin, just a few minutes a day in bright sun is probably enough.
And everyone should take care not to burn. Sunburn increases your chances of skin cancer.

What are the symptoms?
BCC can vary in appearance. For example, it can look like:


a clear, raised lump on the skin, a bit like a blister, sometimes with tiny 'spider'
veins around the edges



a red patch with crusting at the centre, or


scabs and crusty patches that don’t heal.


When it’s more advanced it can cover a larger area, with a less well-defined shape.
Also, if you stretch the skin under a bright light, BCC often has a 'pearl-like' appearance.

Diagnosing BCC
To properly diagnose BCC means having a test called a biopsy. This means that your doctor cuts away a small sample of the affected skin, which
is then examined under a microscope.

If you need to have a larger area of tissue removed, you may need stitches to close
the wound.

What treatments are available?
Surgery
The main treatment for curing BCC is surgery. There are several kinds of surgery. The main type is called curettage and electrodesiccation. Despite the complicated name this is a fairly simple procedure.

The surgeon:


cuts away the area affected by the cancer


uses an electrical needle to burn away any cancer cells left nearby, and finally


stitches up the wound.


You may have a different type of surgery depending on where your cancer is.
For example, if the cancer is on your face, you may be able to have a technique that
leaves much smaller scars than if you have it elsewhere on your body.

This technique is called Mohs surgery. To have this treatment you may have to travel to a specialist clinic, as it’s not
available everywhere.

Non-surgical treatments
If you don’t want to have surgery, you may be able to have other treatments.
Cryotherapy
One treatment that can be useful on small cancers that are only in the surface layers
of the skin is called cryotherapy or cryosurgery. This means that the cancer is destroyed by freezing it.

With this treatment:


your doctor sprays liquid nitrogen onto the affected area


this freezes the cancer cells, which kills them


about an hour later, a blister will have formed. Your doctor or a nurse may need to
drain fluid from this blister with a needle



a scab will form on top of the blister. This scab usually drops off after about two
weeks.



Some people need more than one session of this treatment to get rid of their cancer
completely. As you can imagine, this treatment can also be painful in the short term.

Creams that destroy cancer cells
Another non-surgical treatment for BCC involves using cream to destroy the cancer cells.

If you have this treatment you will need to be monitored regularly by a skin specialist
(dermatologist). For the treatment to work, you will need to apply the cream on most days for several
weeks, as instructed by the dermatologist. Over time, the cream destroys the cancer
cells.

Treatment with light
Some people can have a treatment called phototherapy, which uses bright light to kill cancer cells. This treatment is only useful for
small areas of BCC that have not gone deep into the skin.

With this treatment:


a special cream is applied to the affected area of skin and left for several hours


your doctor then cleans away the cream


the doctor then shines bright light onto the skin for about 15 minutes


the light reacts with the cream that has been absorbed by the cancer cells, killing
the cells.



BCC that has spread (metastatic BCC)
Cancer that spreads to other parts of the body is called metastatic cancer. But it is extremely rare for BCC to spread in this way. It happens to one in every few hundred people with
BCC.

If it does happen, drug treatments can slow down the spread of the cancer. But they
can’t stop it. When this happens, the cancer is usually fatal within a few months
or years.

What to expect in the future
Basal cell carcinoma is not one of the more dangerous types of skin cancer. But you
should still see a doctor if you think you might be affected by any type of skin cancer.

Surgery to remove BCC works well. But the cancer can sometimes come back. So some
people need to have more treatment.

If you have had BCC once it increases your chances of having it again. So you should
keep an eye on your skin, and take care not to spend too much time in the sun.

Your doctor should help you arrange regular check-ups with a dermatologist, who will
know what to look out for."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/3000188/Bag-valve-mask%20ventilation,Bag-valve-mask ventilation,"Bag-valve-mask ventilation Last published: Apr 09, 2020
Breathing with the help of this simple device helps you to get enough oxygen if you
are having trouble breathing normally. It’s often used in emergency situations, or
when someone has lost consciousness (isn’t awake).

It doesn’t involve putting any tubes into your mouth, throat, or lungs.
What is bag-valve-mask ventilation?
This procedure is a very basic way of getting oxygen into your lungs if you are struggling
to breathe normally.

The device is simple. A soft plastic bag is supplied with oxygen through a tube at
one end. At the other end, a mask fits over the mouth and nose. The valve controls
how much oxygen flows into the bag. The procedure works like this:



One medic holds the mask gently but firmly in place, to make sure that the oxygen
goes where it’s needed.





The medic tilts your chin and head to open up your airway (you might hear it called
your windpipe).





A second medic squeezes gently on the bag so that oxygen is pushed in a regular rhythm
into the mouth and nose.





When the procedure is working properly, the medics will be able to see your chest
rising and falling as the oxygen is pumped in and out of your lungs. You breathe through
the mask without needing to put any tubes into your mouth or nose.



Why might I need bag-valve-mask ventilation?
The main reason you might need this procedure is if you have stopped breathing, or
if you are not breathing as easily as you should.

A different procedure, called intubation, involves putting a tube through the nose
or mouth and into the windpipe. Oxygen is then pumped slowly through this tube.

This method is often preferred as it doesn’t need a medic to hold the mask in place.
It’s also a better way of getting oxygen into the lungs in people with severe injuries
whose lungs are not working at all.

But the bag-valve-mask method might be used instead:


if intubation isn’t possible for any reason, or




as a temporary measure, if the medics looking after you are waiting for a doctor who
is trained to perform intubation.



Medics often consider bag-valve-mask ventilation to be the best option for children
who are having trouble breathing.

What are the risks?
If you have this procedure, the medic will keep a close eye on how it is working.
In particular, he or she will check that your chest is rising and falling. This shows
that your airway is open and the oxygen is reaching your lungs and not your stomach.


If the oxygen is pumped into your stomach this can cause problems. For example, it
can cause vomiting. If this happens, there is a chance that you could breathe vomit
into your lungs, and that this could then block your airway.

Medics also need to take special care when treating someone who might have a spine
injury. This usually involves trying to open the airway without moving the head, so
that they don’t disturb the spine.

What can I expect afterwards?
If you need help to breathe it’s likely to be a sign of another medical problem. For
example, you might already be in hospital and need help to breathe from time to time.
Of you might be in an emergency situation: for example, an accident.

So you will probably need other kinds of treatment, depending on what has happened.


As for the bag-mask-valve ventilation, this will continue as long as needed. This
could be when you regain consciousness (wake up) and can breathe on your own, or when
you can be intubated."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1551188066118/Bad%20breath,Bad breath,"Bad breath Last published: Sep 27, 2021
Bad breath is a common problem. It can be embarrassing, but there are treatments that
can help.
We've looked at the best and most up-to-date research to produce this information.
You can use it to talk to your dentist or doctor and decide which treatments are right
for you.

What happens?
Everyone gets bad-smelling breath sometimes. It’s common first thing in the morning
and after eating strong-smelling foods, such as onions and garlic. It usually goes
away when you clean your teeth.

But sometimes bad breath lasts through the day. Doctors call this halitosis. It’s
often caused by dental problems, gum disease, or bacteria on your tongue.

Gum disease is caused by plaque. Plaque is a build-up of bacteria that coats the teeth,
which can then infect your gums. Early, mild gum disease is called gingivitis. Advanced
gum disease is called periodontitis.

Bacteria that grow on your tongue can give off bad-smelling gasses and cause bad breath.
This is more likely to happen if you smoke or don't brush your teeth regularly.

Some people worry that they have bad breath when they don't. They continue to believe
that they have bad breath even after they've been examined and reassured. Doctors
call this pseudo-halitosis.

Other things that can sometimes cause bad breath include diseases that affect the
lungs or digestive system, such as infections. So if you have bad breath that doesn't
get better with the usual treatments you should see your doctor. You may need treatment
for another condition.

What are the symptoms?
People may notice an unpleasant smell when you talk or breathe out. It's possible
to have bad breath without knowing. That's because you get used to the smells that
your own body makes. If you think that you might have bad breath you could ask a trusted
friend, or visit your dentist.

You can get a rough idea of what your breath smells like by licking your wrist, waiting
a minute for it to dry, then smelling your wrist. That tells you how your tongue smells.

Your dentist may be able to give you all the help you need with bad breath. As well
as testing your breath, your dentist should check your teeth, gums, and tongue.

If your dentist can’t find any problems but agrees that your breath smells bad, he
or she may suggest that you see your doctor. Bad breath is sometimes caused by a problem
somewhere else in your body.

What treatments work?
The treatment you need depends on what is causing your bad breath.
Bad breath not caused by another condition
If you have bad breath that is not caused by gum disease or by another physical condition,
you probably just need to make sure you practise good mouth hygiene.

First of all, this means making sure that you brush your teeth well, twice a day,
with a fluoride toothpaste. You can also use dental floss to clean between the teeth.
If you wear dentures, make sure you clean them thoroughly each day.

You could also try mouthwashes that kill bacteria. One common type contains a chemical
called chlorhexidine. But there are other types.

If you still have bad breath after doing all these things you could try tongue scraping,
to get rid of bacteria on the tongue that can cause bad smells. You will need to do
this regularly - perhaps every few days. You do it with a toothbrush or an instrument
called a tongue scraper.

Masking bad breath with things like chewing gum and breath mints might work for a
short time but it won't get rid of the cause of your bad breath.

Bad breath caused by gum disease or another condition
If you have mild gum disease (gingivitis) your dentist will advise you to clean and
floss your teeth thoroughly every day. He or she may also scrape the plaque from your
teeth. This is called scaling. Your dentist will probably also recommend that you
use a mouthwash that contains chlorhexidine.

If your gum disease is more advanced (periodontitis) you may need more complicated
treatments, like scaling below the gum, root planing, or flap surgery. These remove
plaque from the parts of your teeth covered by the gums. You’ll have a local anaesthetic
to numb your gums first.

Bad breath can sometimes be the result of other medical problems, such as conditions
that affect the mouth, throat, or nose. If your symptoms persist after you have tried
better mouth hygiene, and you don't have gum disease, it's a good idea to see your
doctor to rule out any other causes.

Diseases that affect the lungs and the digestive system can also cause bad breath.
So, once again, if your symptoms don't get better with the usual treatments, it's
a good idea to see your doctor.

What will happen to me?
Most people can cure bad breath themselves by keeping their mouths clean. But if your
breath doesn't get any better, your dentist will probably be able to help.

If your dentist can't find any sign of bad breath, he or she will reassure you that
your breath is perfectly acceptable.

If you're still worried about having bad breath, even after you've been reassured
by your dentist, you may have a condition called pseudo-halitosis. This is a strong
fear of having bad breath, even though your breath actually smells fine. If this affects
you, you may need help from a psychologist or psychiatrist."

If you have bacterial vaginosis, you have an infection in your vagina. It's very common
but usually not serious. Having treatment with antibiotics can help to clear it.

You can use our information to talk to your doctor about which treatments are right
for you.

What is bacterial vaginosis?
Usually, there are a lot of 'friendly' bacteria called Lactobacillus in your vagina. They help keep your vagina healthy. If you have bacterial vaginosis,
the balance of bacteria in your vagina is disrupted. The 'friendly' bacteria are replaced
with other bacteria called anaerobes.

Doctors aren't sure what causes bacterial vaginosis. The infection is not usually
passed on during sex. But you are more likely to get it if you have a new sexual partner,
or if you have a lot of sexual partners.

Bacterial vaginosis is not usually harmful and sometimes clears up on its own without
treatment. However, it may increase your chance of serious problems if you are pregnant.

These problems include:


having a miscarriage (losing your baby)


having your baby early (before the 37th week of pregnancy)


having a small (low birth weight) baby


getting an infection in your womb (uterus) during or after your pregnancy


being more likely to get some sexually transmitted infections (STIs), such as gonorrhoea,
chlamydia, and HIV, if you are exposed to them.



What are the symptoms?
You might have a thin grey or white discharge from your vagina. It can have a fishy
smell. These symptoms may be more noticeable after sex.

If your doctor thinks that you might have bacterial vaginosis, he or she will take
a sample of fluid from your vagina. Your doctor might do some simple tests on the
fluid there and then, or send it to a laboratory for testing.

What treatments work?
Bacterial vaginosis is treated with antibiotics. Antibiotics are drugs that kill bacteria.
They help to get rid of the infection in most women.

If you are not pregnant
Your doctor will probably prescribe antibiotics if your bacterial vaginosis is causing
symptoms. You can take antibiotics as tablets that you swallow, or as a gel, a cream,
or capsules (called ovules) that you put in your vagina.

If the infection doesn't go away or if it keeps coming back, your doctor may recommend
using an antibiotic gel twice a week for four to six months.

You can get side effects from antibiotics, including feeling nauseous and having thrush
(a yeast infection) in your vagina.

If you take antibiotics called metronidazole or tinidazole you should not drink alcohol,
because it can make you very ill, with symptoms such as redness in the face, headaches,
trouble breathing, nausea, and vomiting.

You should also avoid alcohol 24 hours after having your last dose of metronidazole
and 72 hours after finishing treatment with tinidazole. This will allow the medicine
to fully leave your body.

Some antibiotic cream and ovules are oil based. This means that they may weaken latex
condoms and diaphragms. This can happen for up to five days after you've used these
treatments.

Ask your doctor or pharmacist if the products you are using are oil based, and read
the information leaflet that comes with them. You should use non-latex contraception
if you are using oil-based creams and ovules.

If you are pregnant
If you are pregnant and have symptoms of bacterial vaginosis, treatment with the right
antibiotics is safe. Your doctor will probably prescribe metronidazole or clindamycin.

Should my partner be treated too?
Experts don't think that bacterial vaginosis is usually passed on during sex. So treating
your partner with antibiotics isn't necessary to help you get rid of the infection,
or to reduce your chances of getting it again. But your doctor may recommend not having
sex while you're being treated for the infection.

What will happen to me?
In some women, bacterial vaginosis clears up without any treatment. But other women
have a hard time getting rid of the infection.

Even after treatment, about one third of women with this condition get it again. To
help reduce the chance of another infection, doctors often recommend avoiding vaginal
douching (where you force water or another solution into your vagina to rinse it out).
Avoiding strong soaps or bubble baths might also help.

Women with bacterial vaginosis sometimes also have infections that are passed on during
sex. So your doctor may recommend having tests for gonorrhoea, chlamydia, syphilis,
and HIV."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/3000245/Bacterial%20meningitis%20in%20adults,Bacterial meningitis in adults,"Bacterial meningitis in adults Last published: Oct 01, 2021
Bacterial meningitis is a life-threatening infection that happens when bacteria infect
the tissues that surround the brain and spinal cord.

Most developed countries have vaccination programmes to help prevent meningitis. But
it can still happen, especially in older people and those living in crowded conditions.

What is bacterial meningitis?
Bacterial meningitis is a medical emergency.

Meningitis is inflammation (swelling) of the membranes that surround and help protect
the brain and spinal cord. These membranes are called the meninges.

Meningitis can also be caused by viruses and funguses. But these types are usually
less serious.

Bacterial meningitis happens when bacteria infect the meninges, causing them to swell.
This puts pressure on the brain, which can cause serious brain damage and sometimes
death.

Even in people who survive, there can be long-term complications, including:



hearing loss


seizures (fits)


memory problems, and


emotional, behaviour, and learning difficulties.


Many countries routinely vaccinate children against several infections that can all cause meningitis. For example, in
the UK, children are vaccinated against:



meningitis types A, B, C, W and Y


pneumonia


Hib (Haemophilus influenzae type B), and


MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella).


This information covers bacterial meningitis in adults. Adults can get this type of bacterial infection in several ways. For example, ear
and sinus infections can lead to meningitis.

In developed countries, adults affected by bacterial meningitis tend to be older.
This is because their immunity is reduced as they age.

Like many infectious illnesses, meningitis spreads more easily in crowded living conditions.
People with certain medical conditions are also more likely to be affected. For example,
those with sickle cell anaemia or HIV have an increased chance of bacterial meningitis.

What are the symptoms?
If you think that you or someone else has symptoms of meningitis, get medical help straight away.

Meningitis can develop very quickly, but it can usually be successfully treated if
you get help fast.

The most common symptoms of meningitis are:



a headache


a stiff neck


a fever


vomiting


being sensitive to bright light, and


being confused and drowsy. In older people, this might be the only symptom at first.


Some people also have a rash that doesn’t go away when you run a glass over it. This rash is possibly the best-known
symptom of meningitis, but it isn’t actually the most common. Just because someone
doesn’t have a rash, it doesn’t mean they don’t have meningitis.

If you are seen by a doctor who thinks that you might have meningitis, he or she will
probably want to do a blood test and a lumbar puncture or 'spinal tap'.

A lumbar puncture involves using a needle to draw some fluid from near the spine.
This can then be tested for bacteria.

Your doctor might also suggest a scan of your head and brain.

What treatments are available?
If you have bacterial meningitis you will need to be treated in hospital. There are
two main treatments.



Antibiotics fight the bacterial infection. These will probably be given by intravenous infusion
(a drip into a vein).



Powerful anti-inflammatories called corticosteroids help reduce swelling of the meninges. This helps relieve the pressure on your brain
and spinal cord.



You might also be given fluids into a vein to keep you properly hydrated.
Treatment for close contacts
If you live with other people, your doctor might recommend that they take a course
of antibiotic tablets, just in case they have been infected with the bacteria that
caused your meningitis.

If you live with any young children, your doctor will want to check that they are
up to date on vaccinations against infections that can cause meningitis.

After your treatment
Meningitis can cause long-term problems in some people. If you have been treated for meningitis, your doctor will want to
assess you carefully for any problems before you can go home.

If there are signs of any long-term problems, your doctor will want to start planning
any future treatment that you might need as soon as possible.

Having meningitis, and having emergency treatment for it, can be a traumatic experience.
So your doctor will want to assess your mental health, and to check if you need any further treatment or help.

What to expect in the future
Most people recover well, but about 20 in 100 people with bacterial meningitis do
not survive.

People are more likely to make a good recovery if they get treatment quickly. But
even with good treatment, some people have long-term complications. For example:



about 30 in 100 people have some degree of hearing loss


some people have seizures (fits) after having meningitis. If you have seizures you
will need to take long-term medication to help prevent them



about one-third of people have some kind of cognitive impairment. This can mean problems with memory, learning ability, emotions, or behaviour.



If you have cognitive problems your doctor should discuss with you the kinds of treatments that might help.

But it can take time for you or your loved ones to notice these problems. If you notice
any cognitive problems at any time after having meningitis, talk to your doctor about
getting help.

Certain things can affect how well people recover. For example, you are less likely
to make a full recovery if you:



are an older adult


have long-term health problems or poor general health, or


had very severe symptoms.


If you are recovering from meningitis, or dealing with its long-term effects, you
might find it useful to get help from a specialist organisation.

For example, in the UK, meningitisnow.org provides information and support for those
dealing with meningitis."

Most of us have low back pain at some time in our lives. When it's bad, you might
just feel like staying in bed. But that usually does more harm than good. Keeping
active is an important part of getting better.

Here, we look at low back pain that lasts less than four weeks (called acute low back pain). You can use this information to talk to your doctor and decide which treatments
are right for you.

What happens?
It's very common to have aches or pains in your lower back, but it's not normally
serious and usually clears up on its own within a few weeks.

Your doctor probably won't be able to tell you exactly what is causing the pain. It
could be many things, such as:



strained muscles in your back. This can happen if you lift something heavy, for example.


bad posture: for example, sitting or standing in a way that puts pressure on the muscles
around your spine.



wear and tear on the bones in your spine (the vertebrae). This is more likely to happen
as you get older.



damage to a disc (called a slipped disc or disc prolapse). This is not a common cause
of back pain.



Most people never know the cause of their back pain. But we do know that certain things
can increase your chance of back problems.

For example, you're more likely to get back pain if you do work that involves lifting
or sitting still for a long time (such as driving for long distances). Being overweight
can also increase your chance of getting back pain.

If you have back pain for a short time there's usually no need to have an x-ray or
scan. It's not likely to show anything useful.

But if your doctor thinks your back pain might be caused by something more serious
like a badly trapped nerve, an infection, or a fracture, you might need to have a
CT scan or an MRI scan.

Also, you should always get medical help straight away if you


feel numb in your bottom


lose control over when you go to the toilet


are unable to walk, or notice that your foot is 'dropping' or dragging when you walk.




These are signs of a more serious problem.
What are the symptoms?
The symptoms of lower back pain can vary from person to person. Your back pain may
come on suddenly or gradually, and the pain may be very bad or relatively mild.

Back pain can make your day-to-day life difficult. You may find it hard to get dressed,
move around, or sleep. But, however much it hurts, your back will probably get better
by itself.

Most people have pain only in their back. But some people have pain down one leg as
well. It could be in your groin, buttock, or thigh, or run right down to your foot.

This is caused by a nerve getting trapped or damaged. It's sometimes called sciatica because it affects the sciatic nerves, which run down your legs. You might feel some
numbness or tingling. If this happens you should see your doctor.

What treatments work?
There are treatments that can help ease your back pain and keep you moving. You may
need a combination of treatments.

Things you can do to help yourself
Staying active may be the last thing you feel like doing. But it can reduce your pain and help you
to recover more quickly.

Staying active means carrying on with the things you usually do, including going to
work, as much as you can. But you should avoid doing things that make your back pain
worse, such as heavy lifting.

Doctors used to recommend staying in bed if people had a bad back. But we now know
this doesn't help. If you stay in bed your joints get stiff. This makes it harder
and more painful to move your back.

And if you stay in bed for a long time your muscles get weaker, so they are less able
to support your spine. This can make your pain worse.

It's unlikely that staying active will do you any harm. But take care if you have
severe back pain. Also, it's best to avoid heavy lifting, bending or twisting your
back, or sitting for long periods of time, until the pain gets better.

To soothe your back pain, you might try applying either hot or cold temperatures to your back. For example, some people use ice packs or heating pads.

Medicines
Taking pain medicine can help reduce your back pain in the short term and help you
keep active.

Doctors usually recommend trying an over-the-counter painkiller first, such as ibuprofen
or another non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).

Another option is paracetamol. Your doctor might also prescribe a muscle relaxant
to take along with an NSAID or paracetamol.

If over-the-counter medicines don't help, your doctor may prescribe a different medicine,
such as a higher dose of an NSAID.

Opioid painkillers, such as tramadol, are another option. But doctors usually prescribe
opioids for only a short amount of time, as you can become dependent on them if you
take them for longer periods. This means you get unpleasant symptoms if you stop taking
them (withdrawal symptoms).

Spinal manipulation
Having your spine manipulated might also help reduce your back pain. It involves moving
parts of your spine to adjust the small joints between the bones to relieve pain and
stiffness.

You may need to have the treatment several times to help with pain while your back
gets better.

Your doctor can advise you about whether this treatment is right and safe for you.
If your doctor thinks that spinal manipulation might help your lower back pain, they
can refer you to a physiotherapist or another trained practitioner.

Other treatments
If your back pain does not improve within a few weeks, there are other treatments
you can try, including physiotherapy and back exercises. You can discuss your options with your doctor.

Many alternative treatments have also been tried for short-term low back pain. They include acupuncture, massage,
yoga, and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). But there is no good
evidence that they work. So doctors don't recommend them.

What will happen to me?
Most back pain lasts less than two weeks, and about 9 in 10 people feel better within
six weeks.

Many people who have had an episode of back pain will have it again. You can talk
to your doctor about ways to reduce your chance of future back pain. Exericising regularly
often helps.

If your pain lasts more than 12 weeks you may find it harder to recover. You may need
additional treatments, such as a talking treatment called cognitive behaviour therapy
(CBT), other medicines, and possibly surgery.

You should see your doctor if your back pain isn't getting better. He or she may refer
you to a specialist in back problems."

You will probably need to see several different professionals to get the advice, support,
and treatment that your child needs.

Your doctor may be able to answer many of your questions about autism. But you may
need to turn to other professionals too.

Here are some questions that you may want to ask:

How do you know that my child has autism? Can you be sure?


How do you know it's not something else?


Will my child be able to attend a mainstream school? If so, is there any help that
the school can give?



How will my child’s condition change over time?


Will my child be see by a specialist or be seen in a department with lots of experience
in caring for children with autism?



Is there any treatment that will help my child? Can I get help where I live?


Can the treatment be harmful for my child?


Are there other treatments that I would have to pay for?


What sort of help can I get with caring for my child at home?


Are there programmes to help me pay for child care, treatment, or equipment?


Are there any local support groups for families who have children with autism?


How can I help my other children to understand about autism? And how can I help them
cope with having a brother or sister with autism?"

People with autism are affected by it in some way throughout their lives. But this
information mainly deals with recognising and treating autism in children.

Finding out that your child has autism can be very upsetting. But understanding autism
and getting help early on can make a difference to your child's life and to yours.

We've brought together the best and most up-to-date research about autism to see what
treatments work. You can use our information to talk to your doctor and decide which
treatments are best for your child.

What treatments work?
If your child has autism it means that his or her brain works in a different way from
most children’s brains. This affects how your child develops.

From the outside, children with autism usually grow like, and look like, other children.
But children with autism don't develop the skills they need to get along well with
others or to keep up in school in the same way as other children.

For example, you may have noticed that your child was different, even as a small baby.
Most children with autism show clear signs of their condition by the time they're
3 years old.

Treatment may help your child with some issues caused by autism. For example, it might
help them with language skills and fitting in at school.

The main treatments for autism involve special methods of teaching your child and
helping change how they behave. Treatment seems to help most if you start while your
child is still young.

It's important to remember that treatments can't cure autism or change how your child's
brain works. They can only help them interact better with other people and the world
around them.

Different children need different types and levels of treatment. For example, a child
who doesn't speak may need different treatments from those children who do speak.
Your doctor should look at your child's strengths and needs before suggesting a particular
treatment.

Education
There are various programmes aimed at helping children with autism to learn, communicate,
and interact better. We discuss some of them below. But they may not all be available
where you live. In some places treatments like this will have slightly different names.

Early education means giving your child extra help with learning basic skills, such as speaking,
before they start school. If you choose to do this in a programme with a specialist,
you will get training in how to help your child.

Applied behavioural analysis (ABA) is a behavioural programme for treating young children (age 2 to 3 years). It uses
a system of rewards to reinforce positive behaviours and discourage what are seen
as negative behaviours.

The ASD pre-school programme is for pre-school children with severe social and communication problems. It offers
parents and carers help with their child's behaviour and language skills.

More Than Words is a programme designed to help parents of children below 6 years of age, with and
without autism, who are having problems with social interaction and communication.


Treatment and Education of Autistic and Communication related handicapped CHildren
(TEACCH) is a structured programme used in schools to help children with autism to learn and
communicate.

Child's Talk uses video feedback to encourage closer communication between parent and child.

Medicines
Most children with autism don’t need medicines. But doctors sometimes recommend medicines
to help with specific symptoms. Below are some of the medicines that doctors sometimes
suggest for children with autism.

Risperidone is a medicine sometimes recommended for older children who have problems with aggression
or irritability, or who are in danger of hurting themselves. It can help to calm some
children. But it has side effects, such as weight gain and raised blood pressure.
If your child is prescribed risperidone, your doctor should monitor him or her regularly.


Methylphenidate (better known as Ritalin) is another drug that may make some children less hyperactive
and irritable. It is often used to help children with attention-deficit hyperactivity
disorder (ADHD), but it doesn't work as well in children with autism, and it has similar
side effects to risperidone.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are antidepressants that are usually used to treat depression. But doctors may prescribe
them for adolescents with autism who also have depression or anxiety.

Other drugs are sometimes used to help children with other symptoms such as sleep
problems, and problems concentrating. If your doctor suggests medicines to help your
child, he or she should discuss the possible benefits and side effects with you and
your child.

Diets, supplements, and alternative treatments
Good nutrition is important for all children, but there are no special dietary needs
with autism.

Several diets and supplements have been suggested as treatments for autism. But there
is no good evidence that any of them have any effect on symptoms of autism.

You should be wary about any 'alternative' or 'complementary' therapies for autism
that you may hear or read about. Some of them may be harmful.

You should always talk to your doctor or a dietitian before making any major changes
to what your child eats or before giving your child supplements or any other treatment
for autism.

Where to get more help
There are many charities and support groups for autistic people. Your doctor may be
able to help you find one in your area. For example, in the UK, the National Autistic
Society (www.autism.org.uk) offers help and support to people with autism and their
families."

If your child has autism, it means that his or her brain works in a different way

For example, you may have noticed that your child was different, even as a small baby.
Most children with autism show clear signs of their condition by the time they're
3 years old.

The condition affects different children in different ways. Some children need help
all their lives, and will not be able to take care of themselves as adults. Other
children can learn the skills they need to live independently.

Doctors aren't sure what causes autism, but it seems to run in families. It may be
down to a combination of genes. If your child has autism, you may worry that something
you have done has caused it. But there’s no evidence to show this could be true. And
there’s no evidence that vaccinations, including the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR)
vaccine, can cause autism.

Autism, autistic spectrum disorder, and Asperger's syndrome
Doctors used to use different names for different types of autism, partly depending
on how severe someone's symptoms were. For example, you may have heard of Asperger's
syndrome, which was often thought of as a 'mild' form of autism.

But doctors rarely make those distinctions any more. And you're more likely to hear
the condition called autism spectrum disorder (ASD for short), and all people with
autism described as being on the 'autism spectrum'.

What this means is that, while everyone on the autism spectrum has the same issues,
these features can show up differently in different people with autism or be more
severe in some people than in others.

What are the symptoms?
If your child has autism, you might begin to notice the signs between the ages of
18 months and 2 years, or even earlier.

You may notice that your baby:


Doesn't look when you call them, even if they seem to hear other sounds


May not look you in the eye, smile at you, or notice when you enter or leave a room


Often seems to be in his or her own world.


As your child grows they may show other signs of having autism. Doctors consider several
main areas before diagnosing autism in children.

Language
Language issues in children with autism range from children who don't talk at all
to children who talk earlier than usual and use language that is complex and advanced
far beyond their age.



Some children with autism start to talk later than other children. Children who don't
say any words by the age of 2 years old are said to have delayed language skills.
But not all children who have delayed language skills are on the autism spectrum.



Some children with autism learn some language skills but then lose them, and stop
talking completely.



Your child may often repeat or 'echo' words and phrases he or she hears.


Some children with autism develop advanced language skills at a very young age, with
complex vocabularies and 'adult' patterns of speech.



General communication


From the age of about 9 months, most children point to things they are interested
in, or that they want. This often happens at the same time as looking at their parents.
It's an early form of complex communication. But children with autism may not do this
much, or at all.



Your child may not interact with you through play in the way that other children do.
For example, they may not want to play 'peek-a-boo' or similar games.



Your child may not use facial expressions and gestures in the way that other children
do, so it can be hard to know what they're thinking and feeling. They may also find
it hard to read your facial expressions.



Problems socialising


Young children with autism might not want to have physical contact and cuddle their
parents as much as other children do. Or they may not want to cuddle until they are
a little older. This can be upsetting for parents and carers.



Your child may prefer to play alone rather than with other children. Or they may want
to play with others, but they may approach and interact with other children in ways
that seem intense or inappropriate. For example, they may get angry when other children
don't fit into their games in exactly the way they want them to.



Your child may form friendships that don't last because of misunderstandings.


These issues usually continue into adulthood to some degree. For example, some adults
with autism become socially isolated (and are often happy this way) while others manage
to have relationships, families, and jobs.

Repetitive and rigid behaviours


Children with autism tend to like routines and may become anxious or upset when their
routines are changed, or when they are not warned in advance about changes to routines.



Your child may get upset about changes in the home. He or she might want to do things
the same way every time.



When old enough to talk, your child may become fascinated by one subject and want
to talk about it all the time. These 'discussions' will probably be very one sided.



Your child might become fascinated by one mechanical part of a toy, rather than with
the whole toy. Or he or she might play with a toy in an unusual way, then get upset
if you try to change the game.



Other signs of autism include having problems with learning, getting very upset by
loud noises or bright light, and having problems with writing and other tasks that
require a lot of physical coordination.

Only a specialist doctor can diagnose autism. If you think your child may have problems,
talk to your doctor first. They should be able to refer your child to a specialist.

Some countries recommend screening for autism at regular intervals, starting in infancy.
When screening for autism your doctor might ask you about how well your child is speaking,
and whether they point, gesture, and interact with you.

What will happen to my child?
Many parents of children with autism worry about what will happen to their child in
the future. In particular, you may worry about what will happen when your child is
grown up, and whether they will be able to look after themselves.

It's hard to say what will happen, as autism affects each child differently. Some
people with autism can live on their own. Others will always need a lot of help. The
right support, education, and training as early as possible may help your child have
fewer problems later on.

Studies of people with autism suggest that:


About 15 in 100 children with autism grow up to live on their own


Between 15 in 100 and 20 in 100 people with autism can live alone but with some help


Many adults with autism need full-time care for the rest of their life.


How well your child copes on their own is linked to how well they can speak and learn.
Some children have a good chance of living alone and holding down a job later on.
But many adults with autism need to live in homes that provide long-term care.

Where to get more help
There are many charities and support groups for autistic people. Your doctor may be
able to help you find one in your area. For example, in the UK, the National Autistic
Society (www.autism.org.uk) offers help and support to people with autism and their
families."

Atrial fibrillation can be alarming, especially the first time it happens. Your heart
beats very fast. It may go away on its own, or you may need treatment to make your
heart beat smoothly again. You can use it to talk to your doctor and decide which
treatments are right for you.

To learn more about what happens in atrial fibrillation and what the symptoms are,
see the leaflet Atrial fibrillation: what is it?

What treatments work?
The treatment you get for atrial fibrillation will depend on how long you have had
the condition, how much it affects you, and what other illnesses you have.



If you've started getting it recently, you may have treatments to try to get your
heart rhythm back to normal.



If you've had it for a long time, or if you are older, you may also need treatments
to slow down your heart.



If you get it only occasionally, you may not need treatment.




Sometimes, simply cutting down on or avoiding coffee or alcohol might reduce how many
attacks you have.



Some people need emergency treatment in hospital to get their rhythm back to normal
quickly. If this happens you'll be given medicines, usually by injections, and possibly
electrical treatment to calm and stabilise your heart.

Treatments to prevent you getting blood clots
Atrial fibrillation can increase your risk of getting blood clots. That's because
it stops blood flowing smoothly through your heart. If you get a blood clot there's
a chance it could cause a stroke.

Unless you have a very low risk of having a stroke (apart from your atrial fibrillation),
you will probably be offered medicines to thin your blood and prevent blood clots.

These drugs, called anticoagulants, can reduce your risk of having a stroke by about two-thirds.

If you take a medicine called warfarin to thin your blood, you will need regular blood tests to check you're taking the
right dose. If the dose is too high you might bleed too easily.

You might be prescribed a type of anticoagulant called a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC). These work in the same way as warfarin, but you don't need to have regular blood
tests as they are more predictable.

The medication you are offered will partly depend on what your doctor thinks will
help you most.

If you're having treatment to get your heart rhythm back to normal, doctors may recommend
treatment to prevent blood clots at the same time. You might be given a drug called
heparin.

Treatments to slow down your heart
There are three main types of medicine for slowing down your heart. You're likely
to be offered a beta-blocker or a calcium channel blocker. Both work well to slow your heartbeat.

But these drugs can cause side effects in some people. For example, beta-blockers
can make you feel dizzy or tired. If you have asthma you shouldn't take a beta-blocker.
It can make your breathing worse.

Calcium channel blockers can make your blood pressure too low, which can cause dizziness.
If beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers are not suitable for you, or if they
don't work, your doctor may suggest you take digoxin instead or as well. Digoxin is another drug that can help to slow down your heart.

Treatments to get your heart rhythm back to normal
There are two things that doctors may try to get your heart rhythm back to normal:
medicines and electrical treatment.

Most people who take one of these medicines get a normal heart rhythm within one hour
to 24 hours. But it may not last.

Some of these medicines can also make your blood pressure drop too low, causing dizziness. And some of them
can make your heart rhythm worse, especially if you have heart disease. So doctors
are careful about which drugs they use, depending on your medical history.

Giving your heart electrical treatment, in the form of a mild electric shock, may get its normal rhythm back. This is done
in hospital, and you'll have a general anaesthetic first.

Another type of electrical treatment that can restore a normal heart rhythm is called
catheter ablation. A thin wire is inserted into a vein, usually in your neck or groin. The wire is
then gently pushed through the vein until it reaches the heart. Radio waves are then
passed through the wire, and they create heat that destroys the heart tissue that's
causing the increased heart rate."

Atrial fibrillation can be alarming, especially the first time it happens. Your heart
beats very fast. It may go away on its own, or you may need treatment to make your
heart beat smoothly again.

What happens?
Atrial fibrillation is when your heart doesn't beat regularly. For some people it
lasts only a short time - from a few minutes to a day or two. For others it comes
and goes and can last a long time.

Your heartbeat is controlled by electrical signals from a 'pacemaker' in your heart.
If you have atrial fibrillation the pacemaker sends out too many signals at once.
Your heart rate will probably be fast and not have its regular pattern.

Men are more likely than women to get atrial fibrillation. It's also more common if
you:



are older


have high blood pressure, or


have heart problems.


Atrial fibrillation can also sometimes be linked to drinking a lot of alcohol, or
to medical problems such as:



diabetes


lung diseases, and


problems with your thyroid gland.


Atrial fibrillation can make you more likely to have a stroke. But there are good
treatments to help prevent this.

What are the symptoms?
The most common symptom is feeling your heart racing.
But this doesn't happen to everyone. Some people only find out that they have atrial
fibrillation after they have a stroke. Signs of a stroke include feeling numb down
one side of your body, problems with your vision, and having trouble speaking or swallowing.

If you have atrial fibrillation you might also feel chest pain, get breathless, and
feel dizzy. If you get these symptoms you should call an ambulance or go to hospital
straight away. They could also be signs of a heart attack.

Tests for atrial fibrillation include:


An ECG (electrocardiogram), which shows how your heart is beating


An echocardiogram, which is an ultrasound scan to produce a picture of your heart.


What will happen to me?
More than half the people who have short-term atrial fibrillation get their normal
heart rhythm back in less than two days without any treatment. But for some people
it's a long-term condition.

Atrial fibrillation increases your risk of having a stroke. But having treatment can
help reduce this risk. To learn more, see Atrial fibrillation: what treatments work?"
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1505126196168/Athlete%27s%20foot,Athlete's foot,"Athlete's foot Last published: Aug 06, 2021
Athlete's foot is an infection that can make the skin on your feet flaky and itchy.
It isn't serious. But it's better to treat it sooner rather than later, as the infection
can spread and become harder to treat.

You can use our information to talk to your doctor or pharmacist and decide which
treatments are best for you.

What is athlete's foot?
Athlete's foot is a skin infection caused by tiny fungi called dermatophytes.
It is very easy to catch athlete's foot. You can pick it up if you walk barefoot in
warm, damp places, such as in the changing rooms and showers at gyms. Or you can catch
it if you touch the skin of someone who already has it.

Your feet are the perfect place for this infection to grow, especially between your
toes. Your feet are warm, often slightly damp, and full of keratin, a protein found
in nails, skin, and hair. The fungi that cause athlete's foot feed on keratin.

What are the symptoms?
Athlete's foot can cause lots of different symptoms, including:


itchy feet, especially between your toes


soggy skin between your toes


dryness and flaking on the soles of your feet


red patches on your skin with a white, wet-looking surface


thickened skin on your feet, and


blisters.


If your skin gets hot, red, and swollen, you could also have an infection caused by
bacteria. You'll need antibiotics to treat this. Otherwise it may spread. If you think
you have a bacterial infection as well as athlete's foot, see your doctor.

What treatments work?
There are several treatments you can buy over the counter for athlete's foot. These
work by killing the fungi that cause the infection.

Many treatments come as creams that you rub on your foot once or twice daily. You
continue using the treatment until you've had no signs of the infection for one to
two weeks. Treatment usually takes two to six weeks.

Treatments for athlete's foot contain different types of medication and are sold under
different brand names. You'll need to look at the 'active ingredients' on the label
to find out which medicine they contain.



Studies suggest that medicines called allylamines work best for athlete's foot. Examples include terbinafine, naftifine, and butenafine.



Other medicines for athlete's foot include azoles (miconazole, clotrimazole, econazole, and ketoconazole), ciclopirox, and tolnaftate. These medicines can also clear up athlete's foot, but they may not work quite as
well as allylamines.



If your athlete's foot is causing blisters or sores, your doctor may also recommend
that you soak your affected foot (or feet) in water mixed with a medicine called aluminium acetate. This can relieve pain and help your skin to heal. You will probably need to do this
twice a day, for seven days.

Things you can do for yourself
We don't know whether washing and drying your feet carefully and wearing clean socks
every day can help to get rid of athlete's foot once you have it. But keeping your
feet clean and dry should help you avoid getting athlete's foot again. Here are some
tips.



Take off your shoes when you're at home, and let air get to your feet. If your shoes
get sweaty, let them dry out before wearing them again.



When you can, wear sandals to let the air get to your feet. Or wear shoes made from
leather or canvas. These natural materials let your feet breathe more than materials
that are man-made.

If you have diabetes, speak to your doctor about the best type of shoes or sandals
and socks to wear. It's important not to risk getting cuts or scrapes on your feet.



Always take off sweaty sports socks and shoes when you have finished using them.


Put on clean socks every day.


Wear socks that absorb sweat. Fabrics that wick away moisture include wool, nylon,
silk, and many synthetics and synthetic blends.



Don't borrow other people's shoes.


After you have a bath or shower, dry your feet carefully, especially between your
toes.



Wear flip-flops or sandals in public changing rooms and around pools.


If you've had athlete's foot, spray the inside of your shoes with a spray to kill
the fungus (called an antifungal spray).



What will happen to me?
Athlete's foot isn't serious, and treatments that you put on your feet will usually
get rid of the infection. However, if you don't treat athlete's foot, the infection
may spread to your fingernails and your toenails, where it is harder to treat. If
you have any questions or concerns, see your doctor."

Asthma happens when the walls of the tiny air passages in the lungs get swollen or
inflamed. This makes it harder for air to get in and out, so that sometimes it is
harder to breathe.

Asthma is common in children. And, although asthma can be dangerous, there are good
treatments to help prevent and treat symptoms.

You can use our information to talk to your doctor about which treatments are right
for your child. To read about the symptoms of asthma and how it is diagnosed, see
the leaflet Asthma in children: what is it?

Treatments for asthma
Medicines for asthma fall into two general categories: medicines that treat asthma
symptoms when they happen, and medicines that help prevent asthma symptoms.

You may hear these called 'relievers' and 'preventers'.

Most asthma treatments are given using inhalers. There are different types of inhaler,
and they deliver the medicine in different ways. To learn more, see the leaflet Asthma in children: types of inhalers.

Your doctor or a nurse will make sure you and your child learn how to use your child's
inhaler properly. Your doctor will probably also give you a written plan to help you
manage your child's asthma symptoms and their treatment.

Reliever inhalers
Most children with asthma will have a reliever inhaler. You may hear these called
quick-relief inhalers. These help to get rid of asthma symptoms when they happen.

Your child may need two, three, or four puffs from their inhaler to relieve their
symptoms. If your child often gets asthma symptoms when exercising, they might also
use a quick-relief inhaler beforehand.



Your child should carry their quick-relief inhaler with them all the time.




Ask your child's school what arrangements they make for children with asthma. Some
schools prefer children to leave their medication with a teacher or the school nurse,
especially if a child is younger. This means they'll have to ask for it when they
need it.





It's important that your child is able to get to their inhaler quickly. It should
be kept nearby if your child is doing PE or playing at break time. It's probably best
for older children to carry their inhaler themselves.



Reliever inhalers work quickly to help your child breathe normally again. If your
child has mild asthma, a reliever inhaler may be the only treatment they need.

Reliever inhalers don't usually cause any serious side effects. But they can make
your child's heart beat faster, and some children get trembling, especially in their
hands. Your child may have trouble sleeping if they use their inhaler just before
bedtime.

If your child starts to need their reliever inhaler more often, they should see their
doctor. They may need additional treatment to control their asthma.

And if their reliever inhaler doesn't improve their symptoms, or their symptoms get
worse, seek emergency treatment.

Preventer inhalers
Along with a quick-relief inhaler to treat asthma symptoms, your doctor may also suggest
your child use one or more treatments to prevent asthma symptoms.

The main preventer treatment is a steroid inhaler. These steroids aren't the same
as the anabolic steroids used by some athletes and bodybuilders. Their full name is
'corticosteroids' and they are similar to chemicals that your child's body makes naturally
to fight inflammation.

There are no definite rules about when a child should be prescribed a preventer inhaler.
But doctors often recommend them for children who



need their quick-relief inhaler more than two or three times a week


have trouble sleeping because of their asthma, or


get severe asthma attacks.


Steroid inhalers help to:


prevent asthma attacks


reduce wheezing


help children's lungs work better, and


reduce the number of times children need their quick-relief inhalers.


But steroid inhalers can't stop an asthma attack once it has started. They work too
slowly. Your child should use their quick-relief inhaler once they get asthma symptoms.

Steroid inhalers aim to prevent asthma symptoms in the long term. They should be used
regularly, once or twice a day - your child's doctor will tell you how often.

Side effects of steroid inhalers
The most common side effect of a steroid inhaler is a sore mouth. It's caused by an
infection called oral thrush, which is caused by a fungus. But these infections aren't
serious and are easy to treat. They may be less likely if your child rinses out their
mouth after using their inhaler.

Another common problem is sounding a bit hoarse after using a steroid inhaler.
Some research has found that steroids can slow down how quickly children grow when
they first start taking them. But it's not clear whether this will affect their final
adult height. It's also worth noting that having asthma that's not treated properly
can also affect your child's growth.

In some very rare cases, steroids have stopped children's adrenal glands working properly.
Your adrenal glands make hormones that help your heart and kidneys work properly.
They also affect how your body uses energy.

But problems with adrenal glands have only happened to children who've been taking
a higher-than-normal dose of inhaled steroids.

What if my child is still getting asthma symptoms?
If your child has a steroid inhaler but still gets asthma symptoms, they should see
their doctor.

The doctor will want to check that they are using their inhaler properly. They may
also suggest avoiding things that trigger asthma symptoms, such as animal fur or tobacco
smoke.

If these things don't help, your child may need to take a higher dose of their steroid
inhaler or an extra medicine for a while, such as tablets that help prevent asthma
symptoms.

This is called 'stepping up'. It doesn't mean your child will always need to take
more medicine. Once your child's asthma is under control, their doctor may 'step down'
their treatment.

Doctors always try to give the lowest dose of medicine to treat and prevent asthma
symptoms. The lower the dose, the less likely your child is to get side effects.

To read more about signs that your child may need extra asthma treatment, see the
leaflet How can I tell when my child's asthma is getting out of control?

What will happen to my child?
Asthma treatments work well to prevent and relieve symptoms, allowing most children
with asthma to live healthy, active lives.

And asthma doesn't usually stop children from taking part in everyday activities,
such as playing outdoors and doing sport. In fact, studies suggest that regular exercise
can improve a child's asthma control, as well as their overall fitness and quality
of life.

But asthma attacks do happen and can be dangerous if they're not properly treated.
A bad asthma attack may mean your child needs urgent treatment in hospital.

If you're ever worried about your child's asthma, for any reason, it's always best
to be on the safe side and call an ambulance.

Some children with asthma grow out of the condition. But not all do. Children with
severe asthma are more likely to still have asthma when they grow up."

Most asthma treatments for children are given using inhalers. There are different
types of inhalers, and they deliver the medicine in different ways.

One of the most common types, called a metered-dose inhaler, involves pressing down on a metal container to release a puff of medicine, which
your child breathes in through a mouthpiece.

Many children use a device called a spacer along with these inhalers. It is a large plastic container that attaches to the inhaler.
The container has a one-way valve, so when a child presses the canister, a puff of
drug is released and stored in the empty space in the container.

This allows the child to breathe in the medicine through a mouthpiece in their own
time, without having to coordinate their breath with pushing on the top of the inhaler.

Another common type of inhaler is the dry powder inhaler. For these inhalers, your child doesn't have to coordinate their breath with pushing
on the top of the inhaler. This is because the medicine is released when your child
takes a deep, fast breath.

With all types of inhalers, it's important that children hold their breath for a count
of 10 after inhaling a dose of medicine. Your doctor or a nurse will make sure you
and your child learn how to use your child's inhaler properly."

Having asthma means that it's sometimes hard to breathe. Asthma can be dangerous,
but there are good treatments to help prevent and treat asthma symptoms.

Here, we look at the symptoms of asthma in children and how it is diagnosed. To learn
about treatments, see the leaflet Asthma in children: what treatments work?

What is asthma in children?
Asthma happens when the walls of the tiny air passages in the lungs get swollen or
inflamed. This makes it harder for air to get in and out.

Like an allergy, asthma symptoms can be triggered by substances in the air. Common
triggers include:



house dust mites


pollen, and


animal fur.


Other things that can trigger asthma symptoms include:


tobacco smoke (for example, when someone is smoking a cigarette nearby)


air pollution


fumes from chemicals (such as bleach)


exercise, and


colds and chest infections.


What are the symptoms?
The symptoms of asthma vary from child to child. Some children just get a dry cough,
which often happens at night or in the early morning.

Other symptoms include wheezing, difficulty breathing, and a tight feeling in the
chest.

Children with mild asthma may only get occasional wheezing and coughing. Children
with more severe asthma may get symptoms more often and might need time off school.

It's not uncommon for children under 5 or 6 years old to have problems with wheezing,
and it's sometimes hard to know whether their wheezing is caused by asthma.

For example, babies and young children often wheeze if they have a cold whether they
have asthma or not.

There is no specific test for asthma. Doctors consider several things to diagnose
the condition, including:



the child's symptoms


the results of tests of how well their lungs are working, and


whether any close family members have asthma (asthma often runs in families).


Your doctor might also do tests to see whether other conditions might be causing the
child's symptoms.

If a doctor suspects a child's symptoms are caused by asthma, he or she will often
prescribe a trial of asthma medicine to see if it helps. The doctor will then check
on the child regularly to make sure the treatment is the right one.

Some children get bad asthma attacks from time to time. Signs of a serious asthma
attack include:



struggling to breathe


struggling to speak


a fast heartbeat


becoming confused, and


a bluish tinge to their lips or fingernails.


If any of these things happen, your child needs emergency treatment.
If you're ever worried about your child's asthma, for any reason, it's always best
to be on the safe side and call an ambulance.

What will happen to my child?
Asthma treatments work well to prevent and relieve symptoms, allowing most children
with asthma to live healthy, active lives.

Asthma doesn't usually stop children from taking part in everyday activities, such
as playing outdoors and doing sport. In fact, regular physical activity can improve
a child's asthma control, as well as their overall fitness and quality of life.

But asthma attacks do happen and can be dangerous if they're not properly treated.
A bad asthma attack may mean your child needs urgent treatment in hospital.

Some children with asthma grow out of the condition. But not all do. Children with
severe asthma are more likely to still have asthma as adults."

The main aim of asthma treatment is to achieve the maximum control of your symptoms
while using as few medicines as possible, and at the lowest possible dose.

You can use our information to talk to your doctor about the best treatments for you.
What treatments are available?
It is important to remember that, however long you've had asthma, the condition should
not stop you being active and doing the things you enjoy. The right treatments can
help you to do this.

Doctors use what they call a stepwise approach to treating asthma. For example, if you're still getting symptoms with your
usual medicine, you may need to take a higher dose or an extra drug for a while. This
is called stepping up.

But it doesn't mean that you'll always need to take more medicine. Once your asthma
is under control your doctor may suggest that you step down your treatment.

Doctors always try to give you the lowest dose of medicine to treat and prevent your
symptoms. The lower the dose, the less likely you are to get side effects.

Your doctor will probably give you a written action plan for your asthma. This will give you detailed advice about how to manage your asthma
and adjust your medicine if necessary.

Monitoring your asthma at home
It's important to have regular follow-ups with your doctor to make sure your asthma
is well controlled.

Your doctor may ask you to test your breathing at home with a device called a PEFR meter (PEFR is short for peak expiratory flow rate).

This measures how quickly you can breathe out. When your asthma isn't well controlled,
you can't breathe out as much air as you normally would because your airways are narrowed.

You'll need to write down the results every time you use the meter. This helps you
and your doctor see how your asthma changes and whether your treatment is working.

Medicines
Most treatments for asthma are taken using inhalers. There are several types, depending on how severe your symptoms are and how often
you get them. They are:



Reliever inhalers. You use these to relieve your symptoms when they happen. If your symptoms don't
happen often, this may be the only treatment you need



Preventer inhalers. If you get symptoms regularly, this type of inhaler can help prevent them happening



Combination inhalers. An inhaler like this that contains both types of medicine may be the best choice
if separate preventers and relievers aren't helping as much as they should.



Reliever inhalers usually contain a type of drug called a long-acting beta-2 agonist (LABA), and also a low dose of a type of drug called a corticosteroid (usually just called steroids). These drugs help to reduce inflammation, which opens up your airways to help you
breathe more easily.

You should carry your inhalers with you at all times. If you get symptoms only once or twice a week, or when you exercise, this may be
all the treatment you need.

These inhalers don't usually cause side effects. But you may get a slight shaking
or trembling, especially in your hands.

Stepping up
If your symptoms happen more than twice a week, your doctor may suggest using a preventer inhaler, as well as your reliever.

Like many reliever inhalers, preventers contain a low dose of steroids. You use this
every day and it helps to prevent inflammation in your airways over the longer term.

Preventer inhalers can help prevent asthma symptoms (including symptoms brought on
by exercise), help you sleep better (because asthma symptoms don't wake you up), and
reduce how much you need to use a reliever.

You're also less likely to need hospital treatment for asthma if you use a preventer
inhaler regularly.

But these inhalers can cause side effects in some people, including:


A sore throat


A hoarse or croaky voice, and


A fungal infection called candidiasis (thrush) in your mouth or your throat.


But not everybody gets these problems. You can reduce your chance of getting these
side effects by gargling with water after using the steroid inhaler.

Steroid preventer inhalers on their own don't help to stop an asthma attack once it
has started. They work too slowly. If you get asthma symptoms you should use your
reliever inhaler. Steroid inhalers help to prevent asthma symptoms over the long term.

For people with severe symptoms, doctors sometimes prescribe steroids as tablets. But they try to avoid this, as
steroid tablets can cause unpleasant side effects, including stomach problems, weight
gain, and mood changes.

Other treatments for severe symptoms include injections of medicines called monoclonal
antibodies. These help to reduce the amount of steroid medicine you need.

How to use an asthma inhaler
There are different types of inhalers. One of the most common types is a metered-dose inhaler (or MDI for short). Here's how to use it:



Take off the cap and shake the inhaler


Stand up and breathe out


Put the mouthpiece in your mouth


Breathe in slowly. As you start to breathe in, push down on the top of the inhaler
and keep breathing in slowly



Close your mouth and hold your breath for 10 seconds


Breathe out.


Another common type of inhaler is the dry powder inhaler. With these inhalers you don't have to coordinate your breath with pushing on the
top of the inhaler. This is because the medicine is released when you take a deep,
fast breath.

This is easier for some people, although others may find it difficult. As with a metered-dose
inhaler, you breathe out before putting the device in your mouth and breathing in.


Your doctor or practice nurse will give you instructions on how to use your inhaler.
They may also watch you using it at check-ups to make sure you are using it correctly
- especially if your asthma doesn't seem to be well controlled.

If you have problems using your inhaler, tell your doctor or nurse. You may find that
a different type is easier to use.

Things you can do for yourself
Learning as much as you can about asthma can help you get better control over your condition. Your doctor should give you
detailed information about how to take your asthma treatments.

You should also discuss signs that your treatment may need to be stepped up (for example,
if you are using your quick-relief inhaler more than usual), and when you should seek
emergency treatment.

Many doctors put this information in writing as part of an asthma action plan. Your
doctor may also recommend taking part in an asthma education programme.

There may be things in your home and outdoors that can trigger your asthma. For example, some people find that symptoms happen when they are around:



Pollen


Tobacco smoke, or


Pets.


Staying away from these things may help to keep your asthma under control.
Some adults still die each year from asthma. You can help keep your asthma under control
by taking your medicine regularly, the way your doctor has prescribed.

If you find your symptoms are becoming more troublesome (for example, if asthma is
waking you up at night), you should see your doctor.

If you feel your symptoms are getting out of control very quickly, call your doctor
or seek emergency treatment. You may be able to avoid going into hospital by taking early action to get control over your symptoms.

If you have had times when your asthma gets suddenly worse, try to remember what made
it worse. This may have been a cold, for example. The next time you get the first
signs of a cold talk to your doctor about what you should do to prevent your asthma
symptoms getting worse.

Most adults with asthma have had it since childhood, although some people do get asthma
later in life. With the right treatment it can usually be controlled well.

What is asthma?
Asthma is a condition that can make it hard to breathe. It happens when the walls
of the tiny air passages in your lungs get swollen or inflamed. This makes it harder
for air to get in and out.

Like an allergy, asthma can be triggered by substances in the air. Common triggers
include house dust mites, pollen, and animal fur. Other things that can cause asthma
symptoms include tobacco smoke, air pollution, fumes from chemicals (such as bleach),
exercise, and colds and chest infections.

What are the symptoms?
The symptoms of asthma can include feeling short of breath and needing to gasp for
air, or you may get a tightness in your chest and wheezing when you breathe. You may
also get a cough.

You will probably find that your symptoms change from one day to the next. They may
get worse at night. You may also have periods when you are free of symptoms.

Sometimes your symptoms may become very severe. If you feel your asthma is getting
out of control very quickly and your usual treatments aren't working, you should see
your doctor or seek emergency treatment straight away.

What will happen to me?
Treatments for asthma work well. If you follow your treatment plan and have regular
check-ups with your doctor, you should be able to live a full and active life.

questions:



How bad is my asthma?


Will I need to measure my peak flow at home? If so, how often?


Do I need to take medicine regularly to prevent the symptoms?


When do I use a preventer? When do I use a reliever?


Do I need to use inhalers or take tablets, or both? Will I be shown how to use an

https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/3000294/Ascitic%20tap%20and%20ascitic%20drain%20procedures,Ascitic tap and ascitic drain procedures,"Ascitic tap and ascitic drain procedures Last published: Dec 09, 2022
These two procedures are broadly similar, but there are a few differences. They both
involve taking fluid from the abdominal cavity - the space between your skin and your
intestines.

You can use our information to discuss these procedures with your doctor.
What is an ascitic tap and an ascitic drain?
Your.abdominal cavity is the space between the skin, muscle, and other tissues that form the outer part
of your abdomen, and the internal organs in the lower part of your abdomen, such as
your intestines (bowels).

This cavity is hollow. But there is always a little fluid in there. Some medical problems
can also cause a lot of fluid to collect there, causing swelling and pain. This fluid
is called ascites.

Ascitic tap
If your doctor needs to take a sample of the fluid in your abdominal cavity they use
a procedure called an ascitic tap.

This involves taking fluid using a needle - a bit like when you have a blood test.
Ascitic drain
If your doctor needs to drain a lot of fluid which has built up in the cavity, the
procedure used is an ascitic drain.

You may also hear both of these procedures called paracentesis.

What happens in an ascitic tap procedure?


You start by undressing and lying on your back.


The doctor finds a good spot on your abdomen to take the fluid. This will be on your
right side, about halfway in towards your navel (belly button), but lower down, just
above your waist. You may have an ultrasound scan first, to find the right place. An ultrasound is a quick, painless scan, just
like pregnant women have to show images of their baby.



You will be awake during the procedure. But your doctor will give you two injections
of local anaesthetic: one near the skin, and one in the deeper tissue. These injections should stop you
from feeling any pain during the procedure.



The doctor will then use a needle to draw out a small amount of fluid for testing.


They will then apply a dressing over the injection site, and the procedure is over.


What happens in an ascitic drain procedure?
The first steps of this procedure are the same as with an ascitic tap. The procedure
is done in the same spot, and you have two injections of local anaesthetic. After
that:



The doctor makes a small cut with a scalpel, just big enough to carefully insert a
thin tube into your abdomen. This is the drain



Inserting the drain through the muscle and other tissues in your abdomen can take
several minutes



The doctor will drain the excess fluid from your abdomen. The drain may need to stay
in for several hours



Finally the doctor will withdraw the drain, and apply a dressing over the cut. They
may also close the cut with a stitch.



Why may I need these procedures?
An ascitic tap procedure is often done to identify the cause of the build-up of fluid in the abdomen,
such as an infection called peritonitis, which is caused by damage to the bowel.

Other things that can cause a build-up of fluid in the abdomen include problems with
the heart, kidneys, and liver, and some cancers. Testing the ascites can help to identify
the cause.

An ascitic drain procedure is used to remove the excess fluid if it is causing pain, discomfort, or
breathing problems.

Not everyone is able to have these procedures. For example, you won’t be able to have
them if you:



Are pregnant


Have a bowel obstruction or other intestinal problems


Have a skin infection such as cellulitis near where you would need to have the injection
or cut, or



Have a condition that affects how easily your blood clots. Doctors call this coagulopathy.



What are the risks?
These procedures are considered safe for most people. But problems can sometimes happen.
These can include:



Bleeding


Fluid leaking from the tap/drain site


Infection


Damage to internal organs during the procedures, and


Fluid building up again so that you need to have another ascitic drain a few weeks
or months later.



If you have problems such as bleeding or infection, you may need to have treatment.
What can I expect afterwards?
You should recover from an ascitic tap procedure fairly quickly. You can take painkillers
such as paracetamol if you need to.

It will probably take a few days to fully recover from an ascitic drain procedure,
as the wound will take a little longer to heal."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1584105894475/Appendicitis,Appendicitis,"Appendicitis Last published: Aug 05, 2021
Having appendicitis can be painful and worrying. You'll probably need an operation.
But most people recover completely and don't have any problems afterwards.

You can use our information to talk to your doctor and decide which treatments are
best for you.

What is appendicitis?
If you have appendicitis it means your appendix is inflamed or infected. Your appendix
is a small tube of tissue in the lower right part of your bowels (intestines). Small
pieces of partly digested food, or fluid in your intestines can get stuck in your
appendix and cause an infection.

What are the symptoms?
The first sign is usually pain in your abdomen. After a few hours the pain may travel to the right side of your lower abdomen. The
pain may be worse if you move, and it might get a little better if you draw your knees
up.

Other symptoms can include:


loss of appetite


vomiting


a slight fever, and


constipation or diarrhoea.


But not everyone with appendicitis gets all these symptoms.
It's very important to see a doctor urgently if it's possible that you have appendicitis. If you don't get treatment your appendix
can burst. This can cause a serious infection called peritonitis.

A burst appendix is more common in babies, young children, and older people. That’s
because appendicitis is harder for doctors to spot in children and older people.

How do doctors diagnose it?
If you have some of the symptoms mentioned above, this should strongly suggest to
a doctor that you might have appendicitis. But there are tests they can do to make
sure.

For example, you might have a CT (computerised tomography) scan. This type of scan
uses x-rays to look at your internal organs. It can spot if your appendix is inflamed.
You will probably also have blood tests.

What treatments are available?
Surgery
If you have appendicitis you'll probably need surgery to take out your appendix. A
burst appendix is also treated with surgery.

There are two types of surgery for appendicitis. If you have open surgery your surgeon takes out your appendix through one cut in the lower right part of your
abdomen.

Or there's keyhole surgery, which is also called laparoscopic surgery. That's where the surgeon makes several
smaller cuts and does the operation through these with the help of a camera.

People who have keyhole surgery are less likely to get an infection or other complications
after the operation. They also have less pain and are able to go home from hospital
sooner.

But keyhole surgery is not available everywhere. It takes a long time for a surgeon
to become expert at this type of operation, so not all surgeons are trained in this
type of surgery.

As well as the surgeon's experience, other things that might affect which type of
surgery someone has include:



being pregnant


being obese (very overweight)


having had previous surgeries, and


being a child.


Whichever type of surgery you have, you'll have a general anaesthetic to make you sleep during the operation, so you won't feel any pain.

After your operation the surgeon will close the cut or cuts on your abdomen with stitches
or clips. You'll have these taken out after a few days. You'll have a scar but this
may fade slowly over time.

You might have some pain after your operation. You'll be given painkillers to help
with this. If your painkillers don't work, tell a doctor or nurse. They might be able
to give you different painkillers or a larger dose.

Antibiotics with surgery
You'll be given antibiotics to prevent infections after surgery. This reduces the
chance of you getting an infection soon after the operation. But some people still
get an infection even if they have antibiotics.

Doctors give antibiotics as a drip (also called an intravenous infusion or IV). You
might need to carry on having antibiotics for a few days after surgery.

Antibiotics can have side effects in some people. For example, some people feel nauseous or get diarrhoea with certain
antibiotics. And some people can have an allergic reaction to some of them.

If you are too ill to have surgery immediately
Some people aren't healthy enough to have surgery straight away. This may be because
the infection in your appendix has already spread, and you might need treatment with
antibiotics for several weeks before you can have an operation.

If an abscess has formed you will probably need to have this drained. An abscess is a build-up
of pus. It is usually drained just using a needle. The doctor uses a CT image to help
guide the needle.

Antibiotics help reduce the pain from appendicitis. You'll probably start by having
antibiotics as a drip. You may switch to tablets when you're well enough to eat.

You may be well enough to leave hospital after a couple of days. But you will need
to go back into hospital when you are well enough to have your appendix taken out,
usually after about six weeks.

Some people who can't have surgery right away don't need to have their appendix removed
if they can have the abscess drained and they get better with antibiotics. But this
is rare.

Treatment without surgery
For some people with appendicitis, antibiotics might be the only treatment they need.
This is more likely if you have what's called uncomplicated appendicitis. This means that the infection and inflammation are mainly in the appendix, and have
not spread into other tissues or into the blood.

What to expect in the future?
As with any type of operation, surgery for appendicitis carries risks, such as an
infection. But most people recover very well. You can live quite happily without your
appendix. You'll probably go home from hospital within a few days.

You should be able to start eating normally again a day or two after the operation.
But you should take at least a week off work or school to give yourself time to recover."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/3000050/Aortic%20stenosis,Aortic stenosis,"Aortic stenosis Last published: Aug 06, 2021
If you have aortic stenosis it means that one of your heart valves is damaged and
isn’t working properly. It is a serious condition but it can be treated, usually by
replacing the damaged valve.
You can use our information to talk with your doctor about what treatments are right
for you.
What is aortic stenosis?
The heart has four valves that regulate the flow of blood around the body. They work
just like the valves in a mechanical pump. The aortic valve controls the flow of blood from the heart around the rest of the body.

If this valve becomes too narrow for blood to flow properly through it, the reduced
blood flow is called aortic stenosis. Without treatment it can be life threatening.


Aortic stenosis is usually caused by thickening of the walls of the valve. This thickening
is called aortic sclerosis. This happens when calcium in the blood builds up on the inside of the valve.

Over time, this build-up can lead to aortic stenosis. Both of these conditions are
more common in older people.

About 25 in 100 people over the age of 65 have aortic sclerosis. And 2 or 3 in every 100 people over 75 have aortic stenosis.

Aortic sclerosis can sometimes be genetic. This means that it happens because of the
genes you were born with.

But other things that make it more likely to happen are:


being male


being older


smoking


having high blood pressure


having diabetes


having high LDL cholesterol (sometimes called ‘bad’ cholesterol)


having chronic kidney disease.


What are the symptoms?
Many people with aortic stenosis have no symptoms, even if they have severe stenosis.
But many people have symptoms, including:



suddenly being more tired than usual after exercising


shortness of breath after any physical exertion


chest pain


dizziness


bruising easily.


If you have any of these symptoms, you should see your doctor straight away.
Even if you don’t have symptoms, doctors can spot the signs of possible aortic stenosis
if they hear a ‘heart murmur’ when listening to your heart with a stethoscope: for
example, during a medical exam or check-up.

A heart murmur is the name for any unusual sound in the heart. It is often a whooshing
sound, a little like when you hold a seashell to your ear. Sounds like this are a
sign that blood is not flowing through your heart in a smooth, regular way.

If your doctor thinks you might have aortic stenosis, or any other heart problem,
he or she will want you to have a test called an electrocardiogram, or ECG for short.


In this test, electrodes are attached to your chest with sticky pads. These electrodes
can detect any unusual rhythm or abnormal electrical activity in your heart. It helps
to tell what kind (if any) of heart problem you have.

Your doctor might also suggest other tests, including:


echocardiography. This is done in a similar way to an ECG. It is the most accurate
test for aortic stenosis



exercise stress testing. This means testing how easily you become tired after physical
activity.



What treatments work?
If you have stenosis that is not severe, you and your doctor might decide to do nothing
for the moment. You will have tests every few months or years, depending on your symptoms,
to see whether you need more treatment.

The main treatment for more severe aortic stenosis is surgery to replace the damaged
heart valve. There are two types of operation. The treatment your doctor recommends
will depend on things such as:



your age


your general health, and


how severe your stenosis is.


Surgical aortic valve replacement
With this operation your damaged heart valve is completely removed and replaced with
one of two types of valve.

Prosthetic valves are entirely mechanical. These are more likely to be used in younger people with
aortic stenosis, as they last longer.

If you have this type of valve fitted you will need to take a type of medicine called
an anticoagulant for the rest of your life. This medicine stops your blood from clotting
too much and helps it flow easily through the valve.

Bioprosthetic valves are partly mechanical and partly made from pig tissue. Pig tissue is used because
it is very similar to human tissue.

If you have this type of valve fitted you won’t need to take anticoagulant medicine.
But it is more likely than a prosthetic valve to wear out over time and need replacing.


This type of valve tends to be used in older people and in people who cannot safely
take anticoagulants. It is the type most commonly used.

Your doctor should discuss the advantages of the different types of valve with you.
But the final decisions about your treatment, including what type of valve to use,
are yours.

You’ll need to stay in hospital for about a week after this operation. But it will
be a few months before you recover completely. Most people need to take between 6
weeks and 3 months off work, and you shouldn’t drive for at least 6 weeks.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR)
With this operation a new mechanical valve is placed inside your existing heart valve.


It is a simpler operation than a complete valve replacement. This means it is more
suitable for people who are not well enough to have a complete aortic valve replacement.


You will need to stay in hospital for 3 to 5 days after this operation. And it will
be a few weeks before you are back to normal.

Balloon aortic valvuloplasty
If surgical treatments are not suitable for you, you might be able to have a treatment
called balloon aortic valvuloplasty. In this procedure a surgeon inflates a small balloon inside your damaged heart valve
to help the blood flow more easily.

This treatment doesn’t help much in the long term. But it is often used to help improve
blood flow enough for someone to have surgery.

What will happen?
Without treatment, most people with severe aortic stenosis will die within 2 or 3
years.

But treatments can work well. Having a successful complete valve replacement usually
results in normal life expectancy.

All surgery has risks, however. An aortic valve replacement is a major operation.
Between 2 and 3 in every 100 people will not survive surgery for aortic stenosis.


Long-term results with TAVR are not quite as good as with complete valve replacement.
But this may be because people who have TAVR are generally older and not as healthy.


If you have either type of heart valve surgery you will have regular check-ups and
tests to see how you are doing. There are also a few things to remember if you have
had heart valve replacement surgery.



Seek medical help immediately if your symptoms come back


Tell any doctor or dentist that you visit about your surgery. This is because you
might need antibiotics to protect your heart against infection during some medical
or dental treatments."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/3000298/Aortic%20dissection,Aortic dissection,"Aortic dissection Last published: Jan 05, 2023
​Aortic dissection is a type of damage that can happen to the aorta, which is the
main artery that sends blood around the body. This damage causes symptoms including
sudden severe chest pain, as if something is tearing or ripping.

Aortic dissection is a medical emergency that requires urgent treatment. If you think
that you or someone you are with has symptoms, seek medical help straight away.

What is aortic dissection?
The aorta is the body’s main artery. Arteries are one of two types of blood vessels in the
body.



Arteries carry blood from the heart to various organs around the body.



Veins take the blood back to the heart.



The wall of the aorta is made up of several layers, a bit like the layers in an onion.
With aortic dissection, the inner layer tears and blood leaks into the space between
some of the layers.

If the leak is large, then there can be a big drop in the amount of blood that can
carry oxygen and nutrients from the heart around your body.

If someone loses enough blood in this way they can bleed to death, just as they could
from an external injury.

With treatment, most people with aortic dissection will recover. But without treatment,
more than half of people will die within 24 hours.

Aortic dissection is not very common. But certain things can make it more likely to
happen. Doctors call these risk factors. Risk factors for aortic dissection include:



Having existing heart problems


Having a condition called Marfan syndrome, which causes weakening in some of the body’s
tissues, such as arteries



Smoking


Having close relatives who have had similar problems


Having high blood pressure


Being male, and


Being over 50 years old.


What are the symptoms?
The main symptom of aortic dissection is severe pain. This pain:



Comes on suddenly


Affects the chest, back, or abdomen (tummy), and


Feels as if something is ripping or tearing.


Less common symptoms can include:


Weakness


Numbness and tingling, and


Being unable to move your legs.


If your doctor thinks that you might have aortic dissection, they will examine you
physically, and you will probably have tests, including blood tests and scans.

What treatments are available?
Treatments for aortic dissection are aimed at keeping you stable in the short term,
and then repairing your aorta.

Your short-term treatments might include:


Oxygen to help you breathe more easily


Fluids to keep you hydrated


Medicines to regulate your heartbeat and blood pressure, and


Pain relief.


Treatment to repair your aorta will depend on how severe the damage is.
If the damage is not too serious, you might just be given medicines to control your
pain, heart rate, and blood pressure while the tissues in the aorta get stronger over
time. You will need to keep taking these medicines for the long term.

If the damage is more serious, you will need surgery to repair the aorta.

What to expect in the future
After having any treatment for aortic dissection, your doctor will advise you to avoid
certain types of exercise. This helps to reduce pressure on your aorta, which could
damage it again.

For example, you should avoid heavy lifting, which can put a lot of sudden pressure on your blood vessels.

Other types of exercise should be fine after a little while. For example, aerobic exercises such as jogging, swimming, and cycling, should be okay, as long as you don’t push
yourself too hard. But talk to your doctor before starting to exercise again.

Aortic dissection can be followed by other problems with your heart and blood vessels
in the future. So your doctor is likely to want to check on you every few months,
at least for the first year or so. This might mean having scans and blood pressure
tests.

Your doctor will also strongly advise you to stop smoking (if you smoke) and to think
about whether you need to eat a more healthy diet."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1456747053300/Anxiety%3A%20what%20treatments%20work%3F,Anxiety: what treatments work?,"Anxiety: what treatments work? Last published: Mar 14, 2022
Everyone gets anxious from time to time. But if you worry so much that it stops you
getting on with your life, there are treatments that can help you feel less anxious.

You can use our information to talk to your doctor and decide which treatments are
best for you.

What treatments work?
Your doctor will probably recommend a 'talking treatment' (psychological treatment),
medicines, or both, to help your anxiety.

The treatment your doctor recommends might depend on what treatment you would prefer
to try, and on how severe your symptoms are. Different treatments suit different people.

Talking treatments
Talking treatments seem to work well for anxiety. One that is used a lot is called
cognitive behaviour therapy (or CBT for short). Or you could have a more general type of psychotherapy.

If you have a talking treatment your symptoms should improve and you should feel more
calm. But these treatments don’t work instantly. And you will need to practise the
things you learn in the sessions, while you're at home.

During these treatments you work with a therapist who has been trained in helping
people with mental health problems.

You normally see someone once a week over a period of several weeks or months. Depending
on how severe your symptoms are you may need to see someone more often. Sessions normally
last between one and two hours.

With cognitive behaviour therapy you and your therapist work together to try to change
the way you think and how you behave.

Usually, the therapist tries to find out which thoughts make you worried and ill.
For example, every time you want to drive you might think, 'I could crash the car.'
Or every time the phone rings you might think, 'Someone must have died.'

You then learn ways to be more positive. For example, you might learn to change the
thought 'My boss thinks I'm hopeless' to 'I must be good at my job. I've never been
laid off, my colleagues like me, and I always meet my deadlines.'

There are many types of talking treatment, and your therapist might suggest a specific
one that could help you, or even a combination of approaches.

Other types of therapy that people have found helpful for anxiety include mindfulness or meditation training, and applied relaxation training. If these therapies aren't available where you live, your doctor might be able to
help you find reliable information about them online.

Medicines
There are several types of medicine used to treat anxiety. The treatment you are offered
will depend on several things, including:



how severe your symptoms are


the type of symptoms you have


whether you have another condition as well as anxiety, such as depression


whether you are taking any other drugs that might interact badly with certain medicines


whether you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant. Some of the medicines used
to treat anxiety are not suitable for use during pregnancy



whether there are particular side effects that might affect you with some medicines.




Short- and long-term treatment
Some medicines, such as antidepressants, are used to treat anxiety in the long term.
But, as these drugs can take a few weeks to start working, you may also be offered
faster-acting medicine to take in the short term while the longer-term medicine begins
to work.

Antidepressants can help reduce feelings of anxiety, and help you sleep better and feel more comfortable
around people.

Antidepressants can cause side effects in some people. For example, some of them can
cause drowsiness, dizziness, nausea, or sexual problems. But if your side effects
bother you, you might be able to switch to another drug and see if that bothers you
less.

Antidepressants are a long-term treatment for anxiety. They start to work after a
few weeks, but people usually take them for at least six months.

Drugs called benzodiazepines work quickly and can help you relax and feel less worried. But doctors are prescribing
them less than they used to. When doctors do prescribe these drugs, it's usually for
just a few weeks, to help while other medicines start to work.

This is because benzodiazepines can have many side effects, including some serious
ones, such as addiction, drowsiness that can lead to falls and injuries, and problems
with memory and learning. They can also cause death if taken with opioid medications.

You shouldn’t take a benzodiazepine if you’re pregnant.
You might be offered a type of medicine called an anticonvulsant. These drugs are usually used to prevent seizures (fits) in people with conditions
like epilepsy, but they can also help with anxiety.

But these drugs are not used as often as antidepressants. They can cause serious side
effects in some people, including kidney problems.

Medicines called antipsychotics can help reduce anxiety and fear and help you sleep better. But, like anticonvulsants,
they are not used as often as antidepressants.

Things you can do for yourself
Talking treatment doesn't have to end when you stop going to a therapist. You may
use it as a way to learn how to help yourself. Then, if old ways of thinking and behaving
come back, you can be your own therapist.

Some people find self-help books and online resources useful. Regular exercise also helps many people to feel less anxious.

You might also try cutting down on alcohol, or cutting out caffeine, especially later
in the day.

Improving your sleep hygiene may help with anxiety. Good sleep hygiene means doing
things that mean you get a healthy amount of good-quality sleep. It includes things
like:



not eating, or drinking alcohol or caffeine, near to bed time


avoiding daytime naps


taking regular exercise


making sure your bedroom is a comfortable, relaxing place


not watching TV or using other devices with screens (such as tablets or smartphones)
in bed.



Your doctor may suggest you join a local support group for people with anxiety, or
perhaps an online group. Sharing your feelings, and hearing other people's stories,
might help you feel less alone and more able to cope and get on with your life.

Anxiety in children
Some treatments have also been tested for children. We know that cognitive behaviour
therapy and some antidepressants work for children with anxiety. But antidepressants
may have serious side effects in children, so they're not often used.

More recent treatments for children and adolescents include smartphone apps. For example, in the UK, the Clear Fear app (clearfear.co.uk) is designed to help young
people understand and cope with fear and anxieties.

Treating anxiety during pregnancy
Medicines are not generally recommended for treating anxiety during pregnancy, and
especially not during the first three months (the first trimester) of pregnancy. Talking
treatments are recommended instead.

But if talking treatments don't work there are some medicines that are more safe than
others for pregnant women.

Useful resources for pregnant women include meditation, self-help materials (such
as books and websites), and relaxation techniques. Online resources in particular
are becoming an increasingly valuable source of help for pregnant women with anxiety.

If you become pregnant while taking medicine for anxiety, tell your doctor straight
away so that together you can decide on the best and safest treatments for you during
pregnancy."

Everyone gets anxious from time to time. But if you worry so much that it stops you
getting on with your life there are treatments that can help you feel less anxious.

We've brought together the best and most up-to-date research about anxiety to see
what treatments work. You can use our information to talk to your doctor and decide
which treatments are best for you.

When worry becomes an illness
Anxiety is a normal human emotion. We all worry at times about things like money,
our families, or our jobs. But some people get more anxious than others.

Anxiety becomes an illness when you worry so much that it interferes with your life.
You can't stop worrying even though you try. You probably worry over lots of different
things. Your worry is out of proportion, and it makes you feel ill and tired.

When worrying becomes an illness your doctor may say you have generalised anxiety
disorder. We call it anxiety for short.

What are the symptoms?
When anxiety is an illness:


you worry too much


your worries have bothered you most days for the last six months


you worry about lots of things at once, even when there is no particular reason to
worry



you can't stop or control your worrying, however hard you try.


Worrying in this way can stop you getting on with your life and daily activities.
Perhaps you're too anxious to drive, or you worry about getting lost if you do. Or
you won't go out because you're afraid something might happen to your home.

Other symptoms
For your doctor to diagnose anxiety you will also have at least three of these other
symptoms:



you're restless and can't relax


you get tired easily


you can't concentrate


you're irritable


your muscles are tense


you sleep badly.


Physical symptoms
Some people with anxiety also get physical symptoms. For example, you may get cold,
clammy hands, have a dry mouth, or feel sick. Or, when you feel anxious, you may get
diarrhoea, palpitations (which is when your heart beats faster or stronger than normal),
headaches, or shortness of breath. These symptoms can be very frightening. But there
is usually nothing physically wrong.

What will happen to me?
You'll probably never get rid of your worries completely. But getting professional
help should help you control them so that they don't take over your life. Your life
will no longer be full of worry. And your other symptoms (such as headaches or problems
sleeping) should also improve."

If you've been diagnosed with anxiety disorder, you may want to ask your doctor some
of these questions.



What exactly does my diagnosis mean?


Why do I have anxiety disorder?


Can my anxiety be treated?


What are my options for treatment?


Will any of these treatments make me better?


What can treatment do for me?


Will I get side effects from my treatment?


How long will it be before I feel better?


Will I need treatment for the rest of my life?


What kind of health professional is best qualified to help me?


Can I have cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) instead of drugs?


If I take medicine for my anxiety will I become addicted?


Is there anything I can do to help myself?


I've had these feelings for a long time. Does this mean I'll always have them?


What will happen if I don't get treatment?"

Antibiotics help fight bacterial infections, make some surgeries safer, and help keep
wounds free of germs while they heal. But using them when they’re not needed, or not
using them properly, is leading to the germs becoming resistant to them so that they
don’t work as well.
This leaflet explains:


which types of infection can be treated by antibiotics and which can’t


why doctors sometimes don’t prescribe antibiotics for infections that are probably
viral, and



what antibiotic resistance is, and what we need to do about it.


What are antibiotics?
Antibiotics are drugs that kill germs called bacteria. Most bacteria are actually
not harmful to people. In fact, we need many of them to stay healthy, including some
that live in our intestines (guts) and help us to digest food.

But some bacteria can cause illnesses and even death. If you have a serious infection
that’s caused by bacteria, antibiotics can be useful, and even life saving. For example,
if you have had surgery they can prevent infections developing and treat infections
that do develop.

Antibiotics can be taken as tablets or as liquid medicine. They can also be given
as injections, and an intravenous (IV) drip.

Why might my doctor not prescribe antibiotics?
Not all infections can be cured with antibiotics. This is because bacteria are not
the only things that cause infections. Things like viruses and funguses can also cause
infections. But these can be treated with antivirals and antifungals, not with antibiotics.




Antibiotics only work for infections caused by bacteria.


Antibiotics will not cure infections caused by viruses or funguses.


Most of the common infections that make us feel ill are caused by viruses, not by
bacteria. These include:



influenza (flu)


the common cold


most coughs and sore throats


many stomach bugs


most middle-ear infections, which are common in children.


Even chest infections and bad coughs that can last for weeks (often called upper respiratory
tract infections) are usually caused by viruses, not by bacteria.

But with many infections it’s not clear what the cause is. For example, you may see
your doctor because of infection and he or she knows it’s probably caused by a virus
(in which case antibiotics won’t help). But there is still a chance that it could
be caused by bacteria.

The doctor might not be able to tell the cause of an infection without further tests,
such as blood tests or sputum samples. But it can take days for your doctor to get
the results of these tests.

So, doesn’t it make sense for your doctor to prescribe antibiotics, just in case your
illness is caused by bacteria? After all, it can’t do any harm, can it?

Actually, it can. For many years doctors have sometimes prescribed antibiotics for
common illnesses such as coughs and sore throats ‘just in case’. It helped patients
feel that they were being treated and it helped doctors avoid refusing medicine to
someone.

But this is changing. For one thing it’s simply not a good idea to give someone medicine
they don’t need. Antibiotics, like all medicines, can cause side effects, including
rashes, itching, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, headaches, dizziness, vaginal discharge,
and, rarely, serious allergic reactions.

Also, most infections, even those caused by bacteria, are what’s called ‘self-limiting’.
This means that they will clear up on their own without treatment. Taking antibiotics
might shorten how long many of these illnesses last, but usually only by a few hours.


But there is a more serious reason why your doctor might not want to give you antibiotics
for a common illness. It’s called antibiotic resistance.

What is antibiotic resistance?
You may have heard of the phrase ‘antibiotic resistance’. And you may have seen stories
in the media about how we are ‘running out of antibiotics’.

Bacteria are living organisms. Like many other living organisms they adapt to changes
in their world. Many bacteria have now adapted to antibiotics. This means that they
are much harder to kill. One example that you might have heard of is methicillin-resistant
staphylococcus aureus, better known as MRSA.

In the most serious cases, some bacteria are now becoming resistant to all antibiotics.
Antibiotic resistance has happened for two reasons:



Overuse. When antibiotics are used a lot, the strongest strains of the germs are the
ones that survive. These strong strains then multiply and become dominant, making
the infections harder to treat. So it’s crucial that we only use antibiotics when
they’re really needed, and not for minor illnesses that will get better by themselves.




Misuse. When someone is prescribed antibiotics and doesn’t follow the instructions
properly, or doesn’t finish the whole course, not all the germs are killed. The surviving
germs are now resistant to those antibiotics and can’t be killed by them.



Antibiotic resistance is a serious problem that is getting worse. If we don’t stop
over-using and misusing antibiotics:



many serious infections will become hard, if not impossible, to treat


many operations will be much less safe


minor wounds will become very dangerous and even life threatening


minor illnesses that can currently be cured by antibiotics will become more serious
and harder to treat.



So this is why your doctor might be reluctant to prescribe antibiotics for a simple
illness that’s probably caused by a virus. Your doctor is not brushing you off, or
suggesting that you are faking: he or she is simply trying to stop the problem of
antibiotic resistance getting worse.

And you can do your part.


Listen to your doctor when he or she says that you probably don’t need antibiotics.
Just because you’ve been given antibiotics in the past for a minor infection doesn’t
mean that they did you any good.



If you do need antibiotics, follow the instructions carefully and finish the course,
even if you feel better after the first few doses.



Suggest to your doctor the possibility of a ‘delayed prescription’. This is when the
doctor gives you a prescription for antibiotics that’s dated a few days in the future.
You give the illness a few days to clear up on its own before filling the prescription.
Many people find that they never need the antibiotics.



Spread the word. Talk to your friends and family about what you’ve learned about antibiotic
overuse, misuse, and resistance.



Antibiotics in the future
So are we going to ‘run out’ of antibiotics? If we don’t change our behaviour there’s
a good chance that the situation could become very serious. New antibiotics are not
being developed quickly enough and some diseases are already becoming much harder
to treat. The good news is that if we stop over-using and misusing antibiotics the
bacteria will lose their resistance and the drugs might start to work well again.
But we all have to play our part.



Doctors need to say no to patients who don’t really need antibiotics, and to explain
why they are saying no.



Patients need to understand why they might not be given antibiotics, and why they
should take them properly when they are prescribed them.



Everyone needs to spread the message about using antibiotics responsibly."

Anterior cruciate ligament injury
Your anterior cruciate ligament connects your thigh bone to your shin bone and helps
keep your knee joint stable. Anterior cruciate ligament tears are common sporting
injuries and can make your knee unstable. Physiotherapy can help you to recover. But
if you're very active you might need surgery in order to do everything you did before
your injury.

We've looked at the research on anterior cruciate ligament injuries and talked to
experts about the best way to treat them. You can use our information to talk to your
doctor and decide which treatments are best for you.

How do anterior cruciate ligament injuries happen?
Sporting injuries are a common cause of a torn knee ligament. Anterior cruciate ligament
tears are most common in sports that involve changing direction quickly, pivoting,
or jumping, such as basketball, skiing, football, or gymnastics.

You’re most likely to tear your anterior cruciate ligament if you over-extend or twist
your knee joint. Direct blows to the knee or leg may also tear the anterior cruciate
ligament.

What are the symptoms?
When you injured your knee you may have heard a popping noise as the ligament tore.
Your knee may feel unstable or keep giving way. For some people the injury isn't too
painful, but others find that it hurts a lot.

If you tear your ligament while doing sport your knee will probably be too painful
or unstable for you to carry on playing. Your knee might swell up quickly, but people
don’t always notice it.

What treatments work?
The treatment you need will partly depend on how severe the injury was, and on whether
you've damaged other parts of your knee.

But the thing that might guide your treatment the most is your lifestyle. If you don't
place too many demands on your knee joint - for example, if you don't play sport and
don't have a very physical job - you may not need, or want, a lot of treatment.

But if you have a job that involves a lot of physical activity, or if you play a lot
of sport, you may need intensive physiotherapy to help you heal, and even surgery
to rebuild the ligament.

Soon after the injury
The things to do in the first few days after your injury can be remembered using the
abbreviation PRICEM:



Protected weight-bearing exercise ('protected' means you use crutches, a brace, a knee immobiliser,
or a combination of these). You need to keep your knee moving a little, now and then,
so that it doesn't stiffen up so much that you lose any of what doctors call your
'range of motion'. But you shouldn't do anything that causes you pain.



Rest. It sounds obvious, but you need to rest as much as possible to avoid making the
injury worse. Getting a good balance between rest and exercise can help you recover
more quickly. Your doctor or physiotherapist will be able to help with this.



Ice helps with pain and swelling in the first few days after the injury, but you should
wrap the ice in a towel to stop it damaging your skin.



Compression with an elasticated bandage will help with support and swelling.



Elevation. For the first few days you should rest with your foot at a level that's higher than
your hip.



Medicines. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, can help reduce
pain and inflammation. But they don't help the ligament to heal. Your doctor can prescribe
a stronger drug than ibuprofen if you need it.



You might need an x-ray to investigate the damage to your knee. Some people also need
an MRI scan.

If you're not very active
There are several reasons why you may choose not to have extensive treatment for your
injury:



You don't have a very physical job


You don't play a lot of sport


You have health problems that mean you aren't very active


You're older and less active than you used to be


You just don't want to have surgery.


If this is the case your doctor will probably recommend some physiotherapy exercises
that you can do at home. He or she may also recommend that you sometimes wear a knee
brace to support your knee, and that you take care about the kinds of physical activity
that you do.

Physiotherapy helps strengthen the muscles around your knee. This supports the joint
and helps to make up for the instability caused by the torn ligament. Physiotherapy
can also help you be more aware of your body, so you learn to move your knee in a
way that doesn't risk injury.

Home physiotherapy should strengthen your knee enough so that you can do the everyday
activities you need to do, such as walking and getting about as normal. But you may
not be able to do everything you could do before the injury.

If you're moderately active
If the demands you place on your knee are going to be a little more strenuous - for
example, maybe you enjoy golf, swimming, cycling, jogging, or tennis - you may need
treatment that's more intensive.

This should involve sessions with a trained physiotherapist, tailored to the activities
you want to do.

Your physiotherapist may also recommend that you sometimes wear a knee brace that's
been specially designed for you. This can help support your knee while you are playing
the sport you enjoy, while allowing you a good amount of movement.

If you're very active
If your lifestyle involves you putting a lot of pressure on your knee joint you will
probably need surgery to rebuild the ligament. For example, you may need surgery if:



You have a job with a lot of physical demands, such as working in construction, the
police, or the military



You are a professional athlete


You're not a professional athlete but you play contact sport such as rugby or football.


The aim of surgery is to rebuild your torn ligament. It’s done using a graft, which
can come from your own body (an autograft) or a donor (an allograft).

If you have an autograft, your surgeon will take a section of healthy tendon from
another part of your leg (for example, from your hamstring or from near your kneecap)
and use it to repair your anterior cruciate ligament. You should talk to your surgeon
about which type of graft is best for you.

This kind of surgery will usually take between one and three hours. The operation
can be done as a keyhole surgery through several small cuts in your skin, or as open
surgery through a larger cut. You'll either have a general anaesthetic to make you
sleep, or an injection into your spine to numb the lower part of your body.

You may be ready for surgery within one or two weeks of your injury, but there's no
need to rush into deciding whether you want the operation. You can decide to have
surgery later on if you wish.

Although anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction operations are common, like all
surgeries they carry risks, such as infection, a blood clot in a vein (deep vein thrombosis
or 'DVT'), or damage to the nerves or blood vessels in your knee.

Some people end up with a smaller range of movement in their knee after surgery or
feel pain around their kneecap. You should thoroughly discuss the potential risks
and benefits of surgery with your surgeon.

How quickly you get back to normal after surgery will depend on lots of things, such
as how fit you are and how badly you hurt your knee in the first place. Full recovery
can take between six and 12 months. Most people can run after about four months and
are ready for strenuous activity by eight months.

You should start physiotherapy within a few days of the operation. To make as full
a recovery as possible it's important to stick to your physiotherapy plan, and not
to start strenuous exercise too soon.

You need to be reasonably fit to be suitable for surgery. In general, there's nothing
to stop you choosing surgery if you are older, if an unstable knee is stopping you
from doing the things you want to do.

What will happen to me?
Without surgery, your knee probably won't be quite as strong as before. You'll be
able to get back to your everyday activities, but you might need to adjust your lifestyle.

The damage caused by the injury means there's a higher chance you'll get arthritis
in your knee at some point in the future. It's not clear whether having surgery to
rebuild the ligament can reduce this risk.

Surgery offers the best chance of getting your knee strong and stable enough for sport
and other demanding activities, but the benefits won't last unless you stick to a
physiotherapy programme. Among athletes with a torn anterior cruciate ligament, between
4 in 10 and 9 in 10 eventually get back to full fitness. However, psychological factors,
such as anxiety and confidence, may play a role in whether an athlete returns to full
competitive sport.

If you're starting to play sport again, good technique and footwork are important
to prevent another injury. Strengthening the muscles around your knee and having good
general fitness will also help."

Anorexia is a serious medical condition. Seeing someone you know refusing to eat can
be upsetting. You may feel helpless and anxious. Getting help for anorexia is important.
Treatments can help people with anorexia feel better about themselves so that anorexia
does not take over their life.

What is it?
People who have anorexia are very afraid of putting on weight and try hard to avoid
gaining weight. They may be very thin and weigh much less than is healthy. They often
eat little and skip meals.

Some people with anorexia also make themselves sick (vomit), take laxatives, or spend
hours exercising.

Someone with anorexia may not understand why they behave the way they do. They may
feel ashamed and guilty about their behaviour and often try to hide it. Anorexia can
cause serious damage to the body and even lead to death from starvation.

How can I tell if someone has anorexia?
People who have eating disorders often try hard to keep them secret. Some things that
suggest that someone might have anorexia or another eating disorder include:



eating small portions of food and skipping meals


avoiding foods rich in calories, such as full fat dairy products and sweet foods


behaving strangely around food (for example, cutting food into small pieces and moving
it around the plate but not eating it)



not wanting to eat with others


constantly talking about food


saying they feel fat when they are thin


preparing big meals for family and friends but not eating the food, or eating just
a little or only a few low-calorie foods



being irritable and distressed, especially around mealtimes


feeling full after eating only a small amount of food


leaving the table during or immediately after a meal, often to go to the toilet


lying about food and being very secretive (for example, saying, 'I ate earlier' to
avoid a meal)



exercising more than is normal


being so thin that the outline of their bones shows through their clothes


having fine, downy hair on their face


always feeling cold


drinking lots of water or fizzy, low-calorie drinks (which take away hunger pangs)


missing school or work.


If you're a parent, bear in mind that many children and teenagers are picky eaters
at times. It isn't necessarily a sign of an eating disorder.

But if your child has a problem with food, remember that they can’t help their behaviour.
Your child may be scared or embarrassed and will need your support.

Talking to someone about whether they have an eating disorder can be very difficult.
They may not want to admit they have a problem or they may say they don't want help.
They may get angry.

The most important thing is to encourage your friend or family member to see a doctor.
You could offer to go with them if they feel that would help.

But even if your friend or relative isn’t ready to see a doctor, you can still be
there for them and keep offering your support.

You may also find it useful to talk to someone about your worries. Your doctor may
be able to put you in touch with a local support group for people with anorexia and
their families. The people there may be able to give you some advice about how to
cope with someone who has an eating disorder.

What treatments work?
To get better, someone with anorexia needs to:


recognise they have a problem


want to get better


start to eat more food


put on weight


change how they think about themselves and food.


These things might look simple, but they can be hard to do.
People are more likely to recover from anorexia if they get treatment quickly. Getting
support and advice from health care professionals can help people put on weight. They
can:



advise about an eating plan to safely regain weight


advise about any necessary nutritional supplements, and


monitor weight and health.


Talking treatments such as psychotherapy or cognitive behaviour therapy may help people
with anorexia to change the way they think about themselves and food.

Family therapy, which involves other people in the family as well as the person with
anorexia, may also help if a child or teenager has anorexia.

Some people with anorexia need to be treated in hospital. This may be because their
body systems have become unstable because their weight is so low, and their life is
at risk, or because they have been treated at home before without success. Other people
can stay at home and just go to a clinic for treatment.

Treatment with antidepressants or other drugs does not seem likely to help with anorexia.
However, people with anorexia may be treated with antidepressants if they also have
a condition such as depression.

Where to get more help
If you are worried about someone who may have anorexia, there are charities and support
groups that can help. For example, in the UK, you can get more information from Beat,
the Eating Disorders Association (beateatingdisorders.org.uk).

Organisations like this one can also put you in touch with local groups of people
with eating disorders and their carers. Talking to someone about how they coped with
a child, friend, or spouse with anorexia may give you support and help you cope."

Anorexia is a serious medical condition. It can damage your body and put your life
in danger. Getting help can be hard but is the most important step you can take. Treatments
can help you feel better about yourself so that anorexia does not take over your life.

What is it?
If you have anorexia, you are probably very afraid of putting on weight. You may worry
that you are fat, even though you are actually underweight. You spend a lot of time
thinking about how to lose weight or avoid putting it on.

The illness makes it hard for you to see that you are underweight. Some people with
anorexia feel unhappy and see starving themselves as a way to control how they feel.
It is common to think that losing weight will make you feel happier, better about
yourself, and more in control.

You may not understand the way you behave. You may feel ashamed and guilty and try
to hide it. But anorexia is harmful. You can die from starving yourself.

If you're worried someone you know has anorexia, see our anorexia information that's
written for friends and family.

What are the symptoms?
If you have anorexia, you know what the symptoms are. They have been part of your
life for months or even years. You are underweight and you eat very little, or avoid
eating at all. You worry all the time about your weight. You may exercise for hours,
take laxatives (drugs that make you go to the bathroom) and make yourself vomit.

Anorexia can affect your health in lots of ways. You may:


Stop having periods, if you're female


Feel tired and weak, and have aching muscles


Get dizzy spells, feel short of breath, and feel your heart beating hard (get palpitations)


Have fine, downy hair on your body and face


Get cold easily, especially in your hands and feet


Start to lose your hair


Get constipated


Feel full and sometimes get stomach pains after eating only a little food


Get dehydrated, which makes you feel thirsty, sick, and exhausted


Get dry, yellowish skin.


If you make yourself vomit your teeth may become discoloured.
Having anorexia for a long time can cause heart problems, such as abnormal heart rhythms
and heart failure. It can also cause thin bones, fertility problems (difficulty getting
pregnant and keeping a pregnancy), headaches, and problems with eyesight.

What can I do to help myself?
The best thing you can do is to ask for help. This may be hard, especially if you
do not think there is anything wrong. But if you answer ""yes"" to some of the questions
below, you may have an eating disorder and need help.



Do you make yourself sick to the stomach (vomit) because you feel too full?


Do you worry you've lost control over how much you eat?


Have you recently lost more than 6 kilograms (about one stone) in three months?


Do you think you are fat even when others say you are too thin?


You need to speak to someone about how you feel.Your doctor will be able to refer
you to a clinic that specialises in treating eating disorders. It might help to take
a parent or friend with you.

What treatments work?
To recover from anorexia, you'll need to:


Realise you have a problem


Want to get better


Start to eat more food


Put on weight


Change how you think about yourself and food.


This sounds simple but is hard to do. There is not much good research about treatments
for anorexia. However, people are more likely to recover from anorexia if they get
treatment quickly. Even if you have had anorexia a long time, though, you should get
help.

Getting advice and support from professionals can help you put on weight safely. They
can help you with an eating plan so you can put on weight, and will monitor your health.
You will be given vitamin and mineral supplements if you need them.

Talking treatments (for example, psychotherapy and cognitive behavioural therapy)
seem to help many people with anorexia. For children and teenagers, family therapy
where other family members are involved, is helpful.

Some people with anorexia need to be treated in hospital. This may be because home
treatment has not worked. Others need to be in hospital because they are so ill that
their life is at risk. Many people with anorexia can live at home and visit a clinic
for treatment.

Treatment with antidepressants or other drugs does not seem likely to help with anorexia.
However, people with anorexia may be treated with antidepressants if they also have
a condition such as depression.

What will happen to me?
We can’t say what will happen to you personally. Anorexia is a personal thing. The
good news is that many people get over anorexia. But it's hard work, and it can take
a long time. You are more likely to recover if you get professional help.

From research studies, we know that between 50 in 100 and 75 in 100 people with anorexia
were completely better, 10 to 15 years after treatment. Others still had some type
of eating disorder and about 19 in 100 still had anorexia.

Each year, about 1 in 100 people with anorexia die from the condition.
Where to get more help
You can get support and more information from Beat, the Eating Disorders Association
(http://www.b-eat.co.uk). The Association can put you in touch with local groups of
people with eating disorders. Talking to someone who has a similar problem about how
you feel may help you get better."

Ankylosing spondylitis mainly affects the spine, causing stiffness and pain. It affects
how you can move, and it can cause different levels of disability.
What treatments work?
Ankylosing spondylitis is a condition that causes inflammation (swelling) in the spine.
This can lead to pain, stiffness, problems with movement, fatigue (tiredness), and
problems in other parts of the body.

There is no cure for ankylosing spondylitis, but there are treatments that can help
relieve the pain and swelling, and keep you as mobile and flexible as possible.

The condition affects everyone differently. So your treatment should be tailored to
your needs, with your wishes taken into account.

Learning about the condition
People with ankylosing spondylitis tend to do better when they learn about and understand
the condition. For example, when people understand the importance of daily stretches
and exercises, they are more likely to do them, and to get the benefits.

Many people with the condition join self-help groups for people with ankylosing spondylitis.
These groups can help people to keep up with their exercises, learn more about the
condition, and share experiences with other people who have it.

For example, in the UK, the National Ankylosing Spondylitis Society (NASS) provides
information, support, and group exercise via local branches.

Physiotherapy
Staying as physically active as possible is vital in helping people with ankylosing
spondylitis stay flexible and mobile.

When you are referred to a specialist, he or she should help you to find a suitable
physiotherapy programme. This might be exercises that you do with a nurse or doctor,
or with a group, or at home by yourself.

Whichever programme you use, the important thing is to do your exercises regularly
for the best results.

Stopping smoking
Ankylosing spondylitis tends to get worse more quickly in people who smoke. If you
smoke, your doctor will strongly advise you to stop, and should offer help and advice
on how to do so.

Medicines
Medicines called NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) can help relieve pain and stiffness in many
people. Some that you might have heard of include ibuprofen and naproxen.

These medicines work by reducing inflammation. Your doctor will probably suggest that
you begin taking this type of medicine.

Like all medicines, NSAIDs can have side effects, such as stomach problems, heart
problems, and liver and kidney damage. Your doctor should discuss which of these medicines
might be best for you. You should never take more than your doctor prescribes.

If NSAIDs don’t help relieve your symptoms, your doctor might suggest that you take
a type of medicine called a tumour necrosis factor-alpha inhibitor, or TNF-alpha inhibitor.

Although the word ‘tumour’ appears in their name, these drugs don’t have much to do
with cancer. They are mainly used to treat inflammation in a variety of conditions,
including inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis, as well as ankylosing
spondylitis.

These drugs can cause side effects in some people, including being more likely to
get infections. Your doctor should discuss the possible side effects with you, and
advise you what possible problems to look out for.

Steroid injections (the full name is corticosteroid) can help some people when joints other than the
spine are affected. These drugs are another way of reducing inflammation.

Steroid injections can work well, but your doctor will keep an eye on how often you
have them, as they can cause serious side effects if you have too many of them over
time.

Another option is disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). These drugs are often used to help people with other joint problems, including rheumatoid
arthritis. But they can also help some people with ankylosing spondylitis.

DMARDs can cause side effects in some people, including an upset stomach and skin
reactions.

Your doctor should discuss with you the possible side effects of any medicines he
or she suggests for you. If you get side effects that bother you, you can talk with
your doctor about switching to a different medication.

Ankylosing spondylitis in children
Children with ankylosing spondylitis benefit from physiotherapy and can be treated
with some of the same medicines as adults. But there is evidence that some different
types of medicines might also work well in children.

If your child has ankylosing spondylitis your doctor should discuss all the treatment
options with you.

What will happen?
It’s impossible to say what will happen to you as an individual. In some people, ankylosing
spondylitis gets worse over time, while in others it stays the same or improves.

But we know that the people who tend to do best are those who stay as active as possible
and who do regular physiotherapy.

You will need regular check-ups to assess your levels of pain, stiffness, and fatigue,
and whether any joints other than your spine are affected. This can help your doctor
to adjust your medication to what will help you most. You might have a scan every
few years, to check your spine.

Ankylosing spondylitis doesn’t usually affect how long people live. But people with
ankylosing spondylitis have an increased chance of heart problems. So your doctor
will want to check you regularly for any signs of heart trouble.

If you have any problems with your eyes, see your doctor straight away. This could
be a condition called iritis, which is common in people with ankylosing spondylitis.
It needs to be treated as soon as possible to make sure it doesn’t affect your vision.


If you regularly take NSAIDs for your symptoms you will need regular blood tests to
check that the medicines are not harming your liver or kidneys."

Ankylosing spondylitis mainly affects the spine, causing stiffness and pain. It affects
how you can move, and it can cause different degrees of disability. There is no cure,
but treatments can help relieve the symptoms and keep you moving as much as possible.
What is ankylosing spondylitis?
Ankylosing spondylitis is a condition that causes inflammation (swelling) in the spine.
This can lead to pain, stiffness, problems with movement, fatigue (tiredness), and
problems in other parts of the body.

You might also hear ankylosing spondylitis referred to as one of several conditions
that affect the spine, under the term axial spondyloarthritis.

In some people with ankylosing spondylitis, some of the bones in the spine can fuse
(join) together, causing even more stiffness and problems with movement. Joints in
the hips and knees can sometimes also be affected.

Ankylosing spondylitis can also be linked to other problems, including:


bowel inflammation, which can cause symptoms similar to those of irritable bowel syndrome
(IBS)



tendon pain: for example, in the Achilles tendons


scaly, rough patches on the skin, called psoriasis


a problem with the eyes, called iritis. This can cause redness in the eyes, sensitivity
to light, and blurred vision.



Ankylosing spondylitis is a genetic condition. This means that it is caused by the
genes you inherit from your parents. It usually begins during the teenage years, although
it can start earlier or later.

It is two to three times more common in boys and men than in girls and women. In some
people the condition improves over time, while in other people it gets worse.

What are the symptoms?
Ankylosing spondylitis often takes many years to be properly diagnosed. This is partly
because back pain is common, and it can be hard for doctors to tell one type of back
problem from another.

The symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis can include:


early morning back stiffness that gets better after you have been up and moving around
for a while



pain that gets better if you take ibuprofen or another NSAID (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drug)



pain that alternates from one buttock to another: so you might have pain on one side
one day, and on the other side on a different day



pain that wakes you in the second half of the night.


Other things that suggest that back pain might be caused by ankylosing spondylitis
might include having:



pain in the tendons: for example, in the Achilles tendon


psoriasis


a condition called iritis, that causes swelling in the eye


inflammatory bowel disease, like IBS


shortness of breath


fatigue


disturbed sleep.


There is no test that can tell for certain whether you have ankylosing spondylitis.
Doctors diagnose it by asking you about your symptoms and examining you. For example,
he or she might look to see if your spine is the right shape or if it doesn’t bend
as easily as it should.

But some tests can help with diagnosis. For example, you will have an x-ray of the
pelvis and lower back, and possibly another type of scan.

If the scan and your symptoms suggest that you might have ankylosing spondylitis,
your doctor should refer you to a specialist to get the best help.

A sprained ankle can be painful and swollen. You may find it hard to walk. But most
people make a good recovery within a few weeks or months.

What is an ankle sprain?
When you sprain your ankle you damage the bands of tissue (called ligaments) that
connect your bones together at the ankle joint.

You can also get an injury known as a strain. This is different to a sprain. A strain
happens when you stretch or pull a muscle rather than a ligament.

What are the symptoms?
Your sprained ankle will be painful, swollen, and probably bruised, and it may feel
warm to touch. You might find it hard to move your foot, to walk, or even to stand
at first.

You might have felt a pop or tear when you twisted your ankle. This could mean you've
completely torn or ruptured the ligaments. This type of sprain is the most serious.

You should see a doctor if your ankle is very swollen and you find it hard to stand.
Your doctor may gently feel how tender your bone is and see if you can walk four steps.
This is to decide if you need an x-ray to check whether you've fractured a bone.

What treatments work?
The first thing you need to do is something that doctors and physiotherapists call
RICE. This stands for Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation. It helps to bring down
the swelling and reduce pain.

Rest means just that: you try not to walk too much for a day or two. Put your weight on
the injured ankle as little as possible until the worst of the pain and swelling have
died down.

Ice means using ice to reduce swelling soon after a sprain. You can either put the injured
foot in ice water for up to 10 minutes, or put some ice wrapped in a thin cloth onto
the injured ankle for up to 30 minutes. A bag of frozen peas wrapped in a cloth works
well if you don't have ice. You shouldn't use ice for too long on the skin, or use
it without wrapping it in a cloth, or you could get an ice 'burn'.

You can use ice on the sprain every few hours for the first two days. But after the
first two days this treatment won't help.

Compression means put a fairly tight bandage, for example, an elastic bandage, onto the injured
ankle. The bandage should be comfortable, and not so tight that you restrict blood
circulation.

Elevation means put your feet up: rest your injured foot on a footstool or table when you sit
down.

RICE can help in the early hours or days after a sprain. But when the worst of the
pain and swelling have gone you should start getting up and about.

To move about more easily you may also need to support your ankle with an elastic
bandage. Getting moving early should reduce swelling and help you get back to normal
faster. It is better to do this than to rest without moving for too long. Moving early
can also help to protect your ankle from giving way again in future.

You might also want to take something for the pain, such as aspirin, ibuprofen, or
paracetamol. Aspirin and ibuprofen reduce inflammation (swelling) as well as pain,
so you might want to try one of these first. Aspirin should not be given to anyone
under 18.

If you take ibuprofen or aspirin regularly, this can irritate your stomach or cause
stomach ulcers. But it shouldn't be a problem if you're taking them for only three
or four days.

Other treatments
Physiotherapists sometimes use diathermy to 'deep heat' a swollen ankle with electromagnetic
energy. But there's no evidence that any kind of heat treatment will reduce swelling
or pain. Deep heat creams do no more than heat the skin and won't help.

Surgery
Most people with a sprained ankle don't need surgery and it's unlikely to help. Even
people with severe sprains or even torn ligaments are unlikely to need surgery unless
they routinely put a lot of pressure on their ankle: for example, if they play a lot
of sport.

Surgery has risks. There's a chance the nerves in your foot could get damaged. There's
also a risk of an infection, bleeding, or osteoarthritis (swollen joints).

What will happen to me?
Most people make a good recovery from ankle sprains, but more serious sprains need
longer to heal. It can take up to a year for severe sprains to be pain free.

Severe muscle and ligament tears may not heal completely, and can lead to some longer-term
pain and loss of stability."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/3000076/Anaphylaxis,Anaphylaxis,"Anaphylaxis Last published: Feb 15, 2022
Anaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction that can be life threatening if not treated
in time. It is usually caused by bad reactions to certain foods, medicines, or insect
bites and stings. Knowing the signs and acting quickly when you see them can save
lives.

If you have an allergy that can cause a bad reaction, you can use our information
to talk to your doctor about ways to prevent serious problems.

What is anaphylaxis?
Allergies are common. For example, many people get symptoms such as sneezing, coughing,
and itchy eyes from things like pollen (hay fever) and animal fur. And some people
get a rash or temporary swelling from some medicines and foods.

But in some people the allergic reaction is much worse and can lead to life-threatening
heart and breathing problems. This is called anaphylaxis.

The causes of anaphylaxis seem to differ depending on your age. For example, the most
common cause in children is food allergies. But in adults the main cause is medicines,
notably penicillin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen.

Common food allergies that can trigger anaphylaxis include:


celery


fish


hens' eggs


legumes (this includes peas and some types of beans)


milk


mustard


nuts


sesame


shellfish, and


soya.


It can be hard to predict and control the causes of allergic reactions. For example,
with some triggers, such as nuts and shellfish, just a tiny amount can cause a severe
reaction.

And sometimes it takes a combination of things to cause anaphylaxis. For example,
a bad reaction can sometimes be triggered by:



exercising. This can happen a little while after eating something you are allergic
to. But it can also happen without eating the food that causes the problem



a sudden change in the temperature around you.


As well as medicines and foods, severe allergic reactions can sometimes follow things
like:



contact with latex rubber, and


stings from wasps, bees, ticks, and some types of spider and ant.


What are the symptoms?
The symptoms of anaphylaxis are similar to the symptoms of any allergic reaction,
but they are much more severe and affect the whole body. These symptoms usually come
on suddenly and can include:



breathing problems caused by swelling in the throat and lungs


a hoarse voice


a rash, which can be itchy


swelling of the lips, tongue, or throat


swollen and watery eyes


a runny nose


dizziness, confusion, and possibly fainting


nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea, and


stomach pain.


If you are treated in hospital for suspected anaphylaxis your doctor will check your
medical records for any mention of allergies.

He or she will also ask you, or perhaps someone who came with you to hospital, about
anything that might have caused a reaction: for example, what you have recently eaten,
or whether you have taken any medicines or been stung by an insect.

Your reaction might have been caused by something that you already knew you were allergic
to. Or the cause might have been something you didn’t know about. Either way, it’s
important to find out so that you can try to prevent it happening again.

Your doctor might want to do some tests to find out what caused your reaction. But
the tests will usually have to wait. The most important thing is that you get immediate
treatment to combat the reaction.

If you do have tests, they might include:


a blood test to check that you have had an allergic reaction, and


skin tests to find out what caused the reaction.


Skin tests can be done with patches or with small needles. The idea is to touch or
gently prick your skin with a tiny amount of things that are common causes of allergic
reactions.

If exposure to a substance causes swelling or a rash in the area of the test, this
is a good sign that you are allergic to it.

What treatments work?
People having a severe allergic reaction usually need emergency treatment that aims
to do two things:



reverse the effects of anaphylaxis, and


help the heart and lungs to work properly.


Adrenaline (epinephrine)
You might have heard of adrenaline being used to treat anaphylaxis. Doctors usually
call it by its medical name of epinephrine. It’s a hormone produced in the body’s adrenal glands. It helps in several ways,
including by:



reducing swelling


tightening blood vessels so that your blood pressure doesn’t fall too low, and


making your heart beat faster. This combats one part of the allergic reaction, which
is to make the heart slow down or stop.



The epinephrine is given as an injection into a muscle, and you might need to have
several.

You will also need to stay in hospital for a few hours after having epinephrine injections.
This is because the symptoms of anaphylaxis can sometimes come back a little while
after you have the injections. This is called a biphasic reaction.

Your heart and lungs
Emergency treatment to keep your heart and lungs working might involve having a tube
inserted through the throat and into the lungs so that air or oxygen can be given
more easily.

To keep your heart working properly you might then be given intravenous (IV) fluids.
This helps to make sure there is enough blood in your blood vessels to keep your heart
working well.

Other treatments
As well as epinephrine, you might be given medications to help with other symptoms
of anaphylaxis. These might include:



inhaled medications to help you breathe more easily. These are some of the same medications
that people with asthma use



antihistamines. These are medicines commonly used to treat allergies. They can help
relieve symptoms like itching and rash



intravenous (IV) drugs to reduce swelling. These anti-inflammatory drugs are called
corticosteroids.



Auto-injectors
When you leave hospital after treatment, your doctor should give you a prescription
for two epinephrine auto-injectors. You might hear these called ‘epi pens’, as they look a bit like pens.

Your doctor should explain how you use the auto-injectors and you should carry both
of them with you at all times in case you have another episode of anaphylaxis.

If you have children with allergies who are risk of anaphylaxis, your doctor should
prescribe the auto-injectors along with a personalised written emergency plan.

Treatment for people with heart disease
If you have heart disease, your medication might make it harder to treat an anaphylactic
reaction, and the anaphylaxis might be more dangerous for you.

If you know you have a severe allergy, a specialist heart doctor (cardiologist) should
review your medication carefully. You can still have adrenaline, but tell the doctors
looking after you that you have heart disease. They might want to discuss your treatment
with a specialist as soon as possible.

Treatments to help prevent more problems
After your emergency treatment, when you are safely stable, your doctor might suggest
that you have a treatment called immunotherapy.

This involves gradually exposing you to slightly bigger amounts of the thing you are
allergic to, so that your body can cope with any accidental exposure.

The amounts will still be very small, and you probably won’t be cured of your allergy.
But it could help stop you having such a severe reaction again.

This type of treatment has to be done by a trained specialist. You should never try
to do it yourself.

What will happen?
The most important thing to do after you have emergency treatment is to identify the
thing that you are allergic to and that caused the attack. This helps you avoid it
in the future.

Depending on what you are allergic to, this might involve things like:


carefully reading food labels


asking restaurants to tell you clearly what certain dishes do and don’t contain


doing everything you can to avoid certain insect stings


telling your dentist and doctor if you are allergic to latex, and of course


always carrying your auto-injectors with you."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1546438566844/Anal%20tears,Anal tears,"Anal tears Last published: Jul 24, 2020
Anal tears (the medical name is anal fissures) can be very painful, but they usually
heal after some simple treatments. If they don't get better you may need extra treatment.

You can use our information to talk to your doctor and decide which treatments are
best for you. This leaflet covers anal tears in adults.

What are anal tears?
Anal tears are small rips in the skin of your anus. The anus is the opening from which
stools (feces) come out of your body. A tear here makes passing stools very painful.

Some people get anal tears if they pass hard, dry stools, or if they are constipated.
Diarrhoea may also cause tears in some people.

It's unusual to have more than one tear at a time. If this happens, your doctor may
do some tests to see if you have another problem such as an infection.

Anal tears often heal on their own. But some tears don’t heal for six weeks or more.
These are called chronic anal tears. Doctors think that some tears don't heal because
the muscle that controls the anus tightens up (goes into spasm). The tightness stops
blood getting to the anus. This prevents healing.

What are the symptoms?
If you've got an anal tear, the main things you'll notice are pain, and blood in your
stools.

The pain you get can be sharp and intense. It may last for an hour or more after you've
been to the toilet. There will be some blood, although probably not much. The blood
will be bright red.

Sometimes a small lump or swelling appears at the end of the tear furthest from the
anus. Because anal tears bleed and there's swelling around the tear, they're often
mistaken for haemorrhoids (clusters of swollen blood vessels, sometimes called piles).

What treatments work?
There are some things you can do yourself that may help your anal tear to heal. But
if these don't work, your doctor may suggest some ointment or an injection. If these
don't work, you may need a small operation.

Things you can do for yourself
The first thing to try is eating a high-fibre diet. Fibre is food that can't be broken
down by the body. It makes your stools softer and more bulky and easier to pass. Foods
high in fibre include fresh vegetables and fruit, wholegrain cereals, wholemeal bread,
and wholemeal pasta.

You should also make sure that you are drinking enough water. This might help you
avoid becoming constipated and make passing stools easier.

Having frequent warm baths helps ease the pain caused by the tear and helps to relax
the anal muscle.

Ask your doctor whether you should try laxatives if you are constipated.
Medical treatments
If changes to your diet don't help, your doctor might prescribe an ointment that you
rub on your anus. It helps to open up your blood vessels. This improves the blood
flow to your anus, which helps healing.

For tears that don't heal with other treatments, doctors sometimes suggest injections
of botulinum toxin (Botox) into the muscle of the anus.

Botox works by making the muscle in the anus weaker so that it's less likely to tighten
up. You may get some pain and bleeding after Botox injections. Some people get other
side effects from this treatment, such as not being able to control their gas or their
bowels for a week or so afterward.

If you use GTN or CCB ointments you will need to continue the treatment for six to
eight weeks.

Surgical treatments
Doctors might suggest surgery for people whose anal tears don't get better with other
treatments.

There are two types of operation for anal tears. They are both simple operations and
can be done with a local anaesthetic.

The most common is surgery on the anal muscle. This operation is called an internal
anal sphincterotomy. The surgeon makes a small cut in the anal muscle to weaken it,
so it's less likely to tighten up. It works to heal anal tears in most people.

This surgery can have side effects. It's quite common for people to lose some control
over their bowels (incontinence) for a while after this surgery. And many people have
flatus incontinence. This means they can't fully control gas coming from their anus.
But these problems are temporary.

The other type of operation is called an anal advancement flap. The surgeon stitches
healthy skin over the tear. It doesn't seem to work as well as sphincterotomy but
there is no risk of incontinence with this technique.

What will happen to me?
Most people with an anal tear get better with simple treatments such as taking warm
baths and changing what they eat. This usually happens in six to eight weeks.

Chronic tears are less likely to heal with these treatments. Most people who have
chronic tears need medical treatments to help relax the muscle that controls their
anus.

Surgery works for most people who need it. But some of these people may get tears
again afterwards."

You might develop anaemia if your body is low in iron. This can make you feel very
tired. You might also find you become breathless easily. Taking iron tablets should
help you start to feel better soon.

You can use our information to talk to your doctor and decide which treatments are
best for you.

What is anaemia?
If you have anaemia your body doesn't have enough red blood cells. These cells carry
oxygen from your lungs to cells around your body.

If your red cell count is low many of your body's tissues and organs can't work as
well as they should. As a result you might feel tired, become winded easily, and look
pale.

Anaemia can be caused by many things. The most common cause is not having enough iron.
This is the type of anaemia we look at here. It’s called iron deficiency anaemia.

Iron is a mineral that your body needs to produce haemoglobin, which is a protein
in your blood that carries oxygen. If you have less iron for haemoglobin your supply
of red blood cells drops and your blood cannot transport oxygen as well as it should.


Your body normally gets enough iron from what you eat and drink and from recycling
old red blood cells. But some things can make your iron supply drop too low, leading
to anaemia.



Blood loss. When you lose blood you lose iron. You can develop anaemia from blood loss that
is sudden (for example, from an injury or surgery) or more gradual (for example, from
a slowly bleeding ulcer). Women who have heavy or frequent periods are also more likely
to get anaemia.



Too little iron in your diet. This can happen if you don't eat enough foods rich in iron. Good sources of iron
are meat, eggs, beans, lentils, nuts, dried fruit, and iron-enriched cereals and breads.

Vegans, who don't eat any meat or animal products, have a greater chance than non-vegans
of becoming anaemic.

Pregnant women can become anaemic if they don't get enough iron to keep pace with
their increasing blood supply and that of their growing baby. Many women also need
more iron when breastfeeding, and some babies need extra iron, too.



Poor absorption of iron by the body. During digestion, iron from the food you eat is absorbed into your bloodstream by
your small bowel. However, the iron might not be properly absorbed if the small bowel
is diseased or has been removed. For example, Crohn's disease and coeliac disease
are bowel disorders that can interfere with the absorption of iron and other nutrients.

Some medicines, such as antacids and other drugs that decrease your stomach acid,
can also hinder iron uptake. You need stomach acid to convert iron into a form that
can be easily absorbed by the small bowel.



What are the symptoms?
Iron deficiency anaemia can cause a wide range of symptoms, including:


fatigue


shortness of breath


dizziness and light-headedness


pale skin colour


a sore tongue


hair loss


unusual cravings for non-food substances, such as dirt, ice, paint, or clay. This
is called pica



thin nails that might start to curve backwards (called spoon nails)


poor muscle performance (for example, you might not be able to exercise as long as
usual)



restless leg syndrome. This means you have an irresistible urge to move your legs
to relieve uncomfortable sensations, such as itching or a 'crawling' feeling.



However, you might have no obvious symptoms if your anaemia is mild or develops slowly
over time.

To find out if you have iron deficiency anaemia your doctor will take a blood sample
and do several tests. These include tests to look at the size, colour, and number
of your red blood cells, and at how many new cells are forming.

Your doctor will also measure your haemoglobin level and how much iron is in your
bloodstream and stored in your body.

Your doctor might also do further tests to find out why you have iron deficiency anaemia.
For example, your doctor might look for signs of internal bleeding by testing your
stools for traces of blood. You might also have tests to look inside your digestive
system for problems such as an ulcer or cancer.

What treatments work?
The usual treatment is to take iron tablets, which enable the body to produce more
red blood cells. New cells start forming quickly and most people begin to feel better
after about a week.

Haemoglobin levels usually return to normal in two to four months. However, doctors
usually recommend taking iron tablets for another three to six months to fully build
up the body's iron supply.

You might get side effects from iron tablets, including an upset stomach or constipation.
Your stools might also turn black.

Doctors sometimes recommend people take their tablets with orange juice or vitamin C supplements. Vitamin C helps the body process iron.

Doctors usually recommend taking iron tablets on an empty stomach, as many foods and
drinks, including tea, coffee, and wine, and foods rich in calcium or fibre, can get
in the way of iron absorption. Certain drugs - including antacids and some antibiotics
- can also interfere with iron uptake.

If iron tablets are irritating your stomach your doctor might advise taking them with
food. Or you might try a different type of iron tablet or a liquid supplement.

If these things don't help - or if your iron loss is severe and getting worse - your
doctor might give you iron injections instead of tablets. Some people need a blood transfusion to help replace their iron and haemoglobin quickly.

If an underlying condition caused your iron deficiency anaemia you will need treatment
for that as well. Some people, such as vegans and women with frequent or heavy periods,
might need to take extra iron over the long term.

What will happen to me?
The tiredness and shortness of breath caused by anaemia can interfere with your work,
school, exercise, and daily routine. Treatment can help you rebuild your iron supply
and start to feel better quickly."

use, or about use by someone you know, you can use our information to talk with your
doctor about getting help.

What is amphetamine-use disorder?
Amphetamines (sometimes spelled as amfetamines) are chemicals that have several medical
uses in low doses. For example, they can be used to treat attention-deficit hyperactivity
disorder (ADHD), narcolepsy, depression, and long-term pain.

They were not designed to be used as recreational drugs. But they are often used in
this way because of the ‘high’ that they give. People who regularly abuse amphetamines
or who are addicted to them are said to have amphetamine-use disorder.

Drug addiction has many causes, including mental-health issues and social pressures.
And beating addiction is hard. But help is available. This leaflet is designed to
help you to start making positive changes.

Street amphetamines come in various forms that contain slightly different mixes of
chemicals.



Amphetamine sulphate is usually known as ‘speed’.


3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine is known as ‘ecstasy’ or MDMA.


Methamphetamine is known as ‘meth’, ‘crystal meth’, ‘ice’, or ‘crank’, among other
names.



In their various forms, these drugs can be taken as tablets, injected, smoked, or
inhaled through the nose (‘snorted’) as a powder. Injecting amphetamines can lead
to infections such as HIV and hepatitis, while snorting can cause permanent damage
to the delicate tissues in the nose, and to the lungs.

And risky sexual behaviour while ‘high’ can lead to HIV and other sexually transmitted
infections.

Many people use amphetamines occasionally without any obvious ill effects. But the
effects of these drugs are unpredictable. They can cause serious health problems,
especially when used regularly or in large doses. But these problems can also happen
to people who are not addicts or regular users. They include:



heart attacks


seizures


sudden death


brain bleeds


coma


suicide attempts


hallucinations


depression, and


overdose.


Long-term use can also lead to non-medical problems, such as legal problems, and problems
with relationships, family, work, and money.

As with many street drugs, the dangers of amphetamines don’t just come from the drugs
themselves. People who produce illegal drugs usually ‘cut’ their product with other
substances to bulk them out, so they can make more money from them, or to intensify
their effects.

For example, methamphetamine is often cut with extremely dangerous substances including:


lithium


hydrochloric acid


sulphuric acid, and


iodine.


But even if the bulking substance is not something dangerous, it can still cause problems,
as it can be difficult to judge how much to take.

For example, if someone is used to taking a certain amount of the drug, and then they
take some from a different batch that is stronger (less bulked) it could cause an
overdose, which could be fatal.

What are the symptoms?
The effects of short-term amphetamine use are similar to those of many other drugs.
There is a short-term energetic ‘high’, followed by a ‘crash’ or ‘come-down’, which
can include exhaustion, depression, confusion, and intense hunger.

The physical symptoms of long-term amphetamine abuse can include:


depression


extreme fatigue (tiredness)


confusion


paranoia


hallucinations


paranoid psychosis (losing touch with reality)


memory loss


weakness and wasting of the body (called cachexia)


looking a lot older than you really are


broken skin


a feeling of insects crawling all over you (called formication, or ‘meth bugs’)


skin infections from using needles


high blood pressure


broken or damaged teeth, from grinding.


Spotting amphetamine-use disorder is often fairly straightforward for doctors and
nurses, as many people are diagnosed in hospital after taking an overdose or needing
medical attention for the effects of the drugs.

What treatments work?
Treatment for amphetamine-use disorder often starts when:


someone has overdosed


long-term amphetamine use has damaged someone’s health so much that they need medical
treatment, or



someone needs emergency medical treatment for another reason linked to their amphetamine
use. For example, they might have drunk a large quantity of alcohol and also used
amphetamines, or they might have been injured because of the effects of drugs or alcohol.




This means that most people need emergency treatment. If you have taken an overdose
of amphetamines you will need to stay in hospital while you are treated.

Emergency treatment
If you have swallowed amphetamines, emergency treatment might involve being given
activated charcoal to swallow, either as tablets or as powder dissolved in water.

Charcoal works by trapping toxic substances and chemicals so that your body cannot
absorb them. For charcoal to work well you need to take it within an hour of taking
the amphetamines.

Emergency treatment might also include:


treatment to prevent problems with your heart and blood vessels. Amphetamine use can
cause narrowing of the blood vessels, which can lead to serious problems such as heart
attacks



being placed on a ventilator to help you breathe


treatment for agitation and dangerously high blood pressure. This might include antipsychotic
or sedative medicines to help calm you, which should also lower your blood pressure.



When your doctor thinks that your condition is stable, he or she will want to check
whether you have any infectious diseases linked to amphetamine use, such as HIV and
hepatitis. If you have one of these conditions you might need to have treatment for
it.

Longer-term treatment
When you are no longer in immediate physical danger from your amphetamine use, your
treatment should focus on helping you to stop using amphetamines again.

The treatment you are offered will depend on several things, such as how urgently
you need help, and what is available in your area. For example, you might be offered
some follow-up appointments with a counsellor or psychologist, or you might be able
to enter a drug treatment programme.

Whatever type of help you get, it should focus on several areas, including help with:


social issues. This might include ways to avoid situations and people that make you
more likely to use drugs, and how to form positive friendships and relationships that
don’t revolve around drug use



psychological issues. For example, you might need treatment for depression. The link
between depression and drug use can work both ways. This means that depression can
lead to drug use, and that drug use can lead to depression. You might be offered therapy
and antidepressant medicine. You might also need treatment for other mental-health
problems linked to your drug use.



As part of long-treatment you might also be offered medicine to help reduce your cravings
for amphetamines.

What will happen?
A good drug-treatment programme that offers help with psychological and social issues
seems to offer the best chance of staying free of amphetamines and other drugs. But
these programmes are not always available when and where people need them.

But much of what happens will depend on whether you want to make the most of whatever
help you can get and are ready to stop using amphetamines.

Other things that might affect your treatment include whether you have any legal problems
linked to drug use. For example, you might have regular drug tests if you are on parole
for offences related to drug use.

You might also have to take regular drug tests if you are part of a longer-term drug-treatment
programme. These will usually be urine tests.

You might also need regular health checks, to check for heart problems and other issues.
If you continue to use amphetamines regularly, you should get medical attention urgently
if you have chest pain or shortness of breath."

Amoebic dysentery, or amoebiasis, is an infection in your intestines (bowels) caused
by a type of organism called an amoeba. You're most likely to get it if you've been
travelling in a developing country. This information tells you how you can help prevent
it happening to you.

You usually get amoebic dysentery after eating contaminated food or drinking contaminated
water. It's more common in countries where people don't have clean running water or
may have difficulty keeping kitchens and toilets clean.

If you're travelling in or if you live in an area where dysentery is a problem, there
are some things you can do to try to avoid getting it.

Water


Don't drink tap water.


Don’t drink drinks served with ice in them. Ice is usually made from tap water.


Instead of tap water, drink bottled water (with an unbroken seal), fizzy drinks, or
hot coffee or tea.



You can make water safe to drink by bringing it to a full boil for a few minutes.




You can also use water-purifying tablets and a filter to make water safe to drink.
You can buy these from camping shops.



Don't use the tap water, even to brush your teeth, unless you're sure it's safe.


Don’t swallow any water while you’re taking a bath or a shower.


Don’t swim in water that might be contaminated.


Food hygiene


Avoid drinking unpasteurised milk or eating dairy products made from unpasteurised
milk.



Avoid eating raw fruits and vegetables unless you can peel them yourself.


Don't eat cooked food that isn't piping hot when it's served.


Don't eat food from street vendors.


Wash your hands after going to the toilet and before eating.


If you become ill with diarrhoea after you've been travelling, it's important to tell
your doctor about where you travelled to. It will affect the kind of treatment you
need.

Your doctor can advise you about making sure you don't pass on the infection to other
people. If you work with food or if you're a healthcare worker, you may need to stay
off work until your doctor gives you the ‘all-clear’ to return to work."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1454940538117/Amoebic%20dysentery,Amoebic dysentery,"Amoebic dysentery Last published: Sep 14, 2022
Amoebic dysentery, or amoebiasis, is an infection in your intestines (bowels) caused
by a type of organism called an amoeba.

We've brought together the research about amoebic dysentery and weighed up the evidence
about how to treat it. You can use our information to talk to your doctor and decide
which treatments are best for you.

What is it?
Amoebic dysentery is caused by a type of parasite called an amoeba. People usually
catch it by eating contaminated food or drinking contaminated water.

The parasites then get into your body and live in your bowels, which can cause bad
diarrhoea. If not treated this can cause serious illness and, on rare occasions, death.


Amoebic dysentery is more common in countries where people don't have clean running
water or may have difficulty keeping kitchens and toilets clean. You're most likely
to get it if you've been travelling in a developing country.

Amoebic dysentery can also be passed from person to person. For example, if someone
doesn't wash their hands after going to the toilet and then shakes your hand or hands
you something, amoebas could pass onto your hand and then into your mouth when you
eat.

Even if the infection in your bowels doesn't make you ill, you can still pass it on
to other people. So it's important to get treatment.

Apart from picking up amoebic dysentery while travelling in developing countries,
you might also catch it:



if you live in crowded conditions


if you have a weak immune system (for example, because you're having chemotherapy
or you have HIV)



through oral or anal sex.


What are the symptoms?
The main symptom of amoebic dysentery is diarrhoea. This means you get loose stools
and you need to go to the toilet more often than usual.

You may also get:


diarrhoea with blood or mucus in it


bleeding from your rectum


pain in your abdomen


pain when going to the toilet to pass stools


fever.


You may also lose your appetite and lose weight.
Diarrhoea can make your body lose too much water. This is called being dehydrated.
You need to make sure you drink plenty of water if you have diarrhoea.

If you become so dehydrated that you need to go to hospital, you may be given drinks
called rehydration solutions. People who are so ill that they can’t drink liquids
can be given fluids by intravenous (IV) drip.

What treatments work?
It’s important to see your doctor if you think you may have amoebic dysentery because,
even though the diarrhoea may go away after a few weeks, without treatment you'll
still have the parasites in your body.

This means that you could still pass on the infection to other people, and that the
diarrhoea could come back.

The treatment for amoebic dysentery is antibiotics. Antibiotics are usually used to
kill germs called bacteria but they also kill amoeba parasites.

You'll need a prescription from a doctor for these drugs. You usually take them as
tablets, but some are also available as a drip (also called an IV or intravenous infusion).


You may be given drugs by a drip if you're vomiting a lot and you can't swallow tablets.
If you take tablets you will usually need to take them for between five and ten days.


After you've finished taking antibiotics, you'll probably be given another type of
drug that helps to clear the infection from your intestines. You usually need to take
this for 10 days.

These medicines for amoebic dysentery can have side effects in some people, but they
are usually mild. They include:



nausea and vomiting


pain in your abdomen, and diarrhoea


a bitter metallic taste in your mouth or a tongue that looks coated (furry)


weakness or dizziness


dark-coloured urine


pain while urinating


loss of appetite


rash


trouble sleeping


blurred vision or headaches.


What will happen to me?
If you become ill with diarrhoea after you've been travelling it's important to tell
your doctor about where you travelled to. This will help your doctor to give you the
right treatment.

Your doctor might take a sample of your stool so it can be tested for amoebas. You
might also have a blood test.

Your doctor will also examine your abdomen. This is because, rarely, the infection
can break through the wall of your bowels and affect other parts of your body such
as your liver. This can cause swelling in your abdomen.

If your doctor thinks the amoebas have spread to your liver, you may need more tests
and treatment.

Sometimes the amoebas can cause a more serious condition called fulminant colitis. Fulminant colitis is rare but it causes severe inflammation (swelling) of the bowel,
and it can be life threatening. The symptoms include:



pain all over your abdomen


very bad diarrhoea


fever.


It's important that you see a doctor as soon as possible if you get any of these symptoms.


Your doctor may give you advice on how to avoid passing on the infection to the people
you live or work with.

Make sure you wash your hands after going to the toilet and before preparing food.
If you work with food, or if you're a healthcare worker, you should stay off work
until your doctor says it's safe for you to return."

Last published: Jan 04, 2022
Many of us start to forget things as we get older. But if someone has Alzheimer’s
disease or another type of dementia, this forgetfulness gets very bad. The symptoms
get worse over time.

There's no cure for Alzheimer's disease and most other kinds of dementia. But there
are medicines that might help a little with forgetfulness and confusion. Treatment
should be based on someone's individual needs and their situation (for example, whether
they live alone).

When someone is first diagnosed they should be referred to a social worker or mental-health
professional so that they get the right emotional and psychological support. They
and their carers and family should also be told about community services that can
help.

People with dementia will eventually need a lot of help looking after themselves.
To read more about what happens in dementia and its symptoms, see the leaflet Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia.

Treatments to help with memory and thinking
You might hear the problems with memory and thinking caused by dementia called 'cognitive
impairment'. There are several types of medicine that can help with these problems.
They fall into two main groups:



cholinesterase inhibitors


NMDA receptor antagonists.


Research has found that these drugs can help people with dementia remember things
better, and can help some people look after themselves for longer.

But these drugs don't help everyone, and you're unlikely to see a big improvement.
These drugs can have side effects. Some of the most common are feeling sick, getting
diarrhoea, or not feeling like eating. If side effects become a problem, changing
to a different drug or a different dose might help, so talk to your doctor.

Non-drug treatments
Some people try a herbal remedy called Ginkgo biloba for dementia symptoms. But doctors
don't usually recommend it because research suggests it only helps a little, if at
all.

Bear in mind that herbal products aren't tested in the same way as medicines. You
can't always be sure how pure a product is.

Ginkgo biloba doesn't have many side effects. However, people who take Ginkgo should
tell their doctor. That's because it can be harmful if taken with some medicines,
especially drugs to prevent blood clots (such as aspirin or warfarin).

Getting the most out of life
To help people with dementia get the most out of life therapists often encourage them
to be as independent as possible and to do things they enjoy. If you’re close to someone
with dementia you might want to try some of these ideas yourself.

Some therapists use things like word or number games, practising with money, or looking
at pictures of famous faces. This is called cognitive stimulation. To help someone with dementia feel involved with life, they might be encouraged
to talk about people in family photographs, play games, or do jigsaws. A large calendar
or a blackboard can be used to remind people about what's happening that day. This
kind of approach is called reality orientation.

Music therapy can also be used to try to help someone with dementia feel happier or more relaxed.
It can involve listening to a recording, going to a concert, dancing, or playing instruments.
Some research suggests that music can help people feel less restless and upset.

Occupational therapy aims to help people stay independent. An occupational therapist can give advice on
how to make day-to-day things easier. They can also suggest how to adapt someone's
home to help them cope.

A treatment called reminiscence therapy aims to help people exercise their memory. People with dementia can often remember
things that happened a long time ago better than things that happened recently. A
therapist might ask someone questions about their childhood, or suggest they handle
objects from their past. There’s not much research on this, but it might help.

Even simple things, such as playing with a pet, might help someone with dementia feel
happier about life.

Treatments for people who are agitated or distressed
Some people with dementia become very distressed at times. They may get upset and
anxious, or become convinced that unpleasant things are happening around them. Some
people become angry or aggressive. If these things happen to your relative or loved
one there are several treatments that their doctor may suggest.

Before considering medicines it may help to think whether any changes to someone's
care could help them be less distressed. For example, someone might like more privacy,
or want to be kept busy more of the time.

Drug treatments for agitation can have dangerous side effects. Some drugs aren't suitable
for some types of dementia. Drowsiness is a common side effect of drugs for people
who are agitated, even to the point where someone passes out. Make sure you talk to
your doctor about side effects.

A different drug or a change of dose might help to prevent side effects. If a doctor
prescribes drugs for someone who's agitated, the treatment should be reviewed regularly.
It should be stopped if it's no longer needed or doesn't help any more.

Antipsychotic medicines can help people who get delusions. But they can cause severe
side effects. Antipsychotic drugs increase the risk of a stroke and of early death
when they're used to treat older people with dementia. In most cases doctors should
not prescribe antipsychotic drugs for people with dementia.

Other medicines, such as antidepressants (drugs used to treat depression) and drugs
used for epilepsy, are sometimes used to treat people with dementia who are agitated.
But this is unusual.

Where to get more help
If you have been recently diagnosed with dementia, or if you are caring for someone
with dementia, make sure you get all the help you can: for example, from your family,
and social services. There are also local carers' groups that may be able to give
you support. For example, in the UK, you can contact the Alzheimer's Society (alzheimers.org.uk),
Alzheimer Scotland (alzscot.org), and Carers UK (carersuk.org). Your doctor will be
also able to suggest where you can go for help in your area."

Many of us start to forget things as we get older. But for people with Alzheimer’s
disease or another type of dementia, this forgetfulness becomes very bad. The symptoms
get worse over time.

What is dementia?
Dementia is a term doctors use to describe what happens when certain parts of the
brain stop working properly. The most common type is called Alzheimer's disease.

Other common types of dementia are vascular dementia, which can happen when small
blood vessels in or near the brain are damaged, and Lewy body dementia.

Dementia is an illness. It's not a normal part of getting older. But dementia is more
common in older people. It's rare for younger people to get dementia.

What are the symptoms?
The symptoms of dementia usually come on gradually, although they can start very suddenly
in people who have had a stroke. The first sign of dementia is usually mild forgetfulness.
Other symptoms include:



getting lost or confused easily


forgetting how to do important, everyday things, such as cooking meals, getting dressed,
or using the toilet. This can make it very hard for someone with dementia to look
after themselves



having trouble sleeping


not being able to recognise even close family members.


The problems someone gets because of dementia can make it seem as if that person's
personality has changed. For example:



they might become agitated or moody, pace about, or wander off


they might have trouble talking or understanding you


some people imagine that things are happening to them (this is called having delusions)
or see things that aren't really there (hallucinations). This can be upsetting. For
example, someone might think that people are trying to hurt them or steal their things



they might become aggressive.


What will happen?
There is no cure for Alzheimer's disease and most other kinds of dementia. But there
are medicines that might help a little with forgetfulness and confusion.

To read about treatments, see the leaflet Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia: what treatments work?
It's hard to know how quickly someone's symptoms will get worse. Some people stay
the same for a long time. Others have good days and bad days. Eventually most people
with dementia need help with everyday things like getting washed and dressed.

People with mild dementia might wish to plan for the future and discuss their treatment
with relatives. Some people write an advance directive describing the care they'd
prefer.

People with dementia can lose the ability to keep track of money. So it's important
to decide who should help with decisions about money and health care.

If you have been recently diagnosed with dementia, or if you are caring for someone
with dementia, make sure you get all the help you can: for example, from your family,
and social services.

Alopecia areata is a condition that causes patches of hair to fall out. But it doesn’t
destroy the hair follicle, so there is always the chance for regrowth, which often
happens.

We've brought together the research about alopecia areata and talked to experts about
the best ways to treat it. You can use our information to talk to your doctor and
decide which treatments are best for you.

What is alopecia areata?
'Alopecia' is the technical name for hair loss. Alopecia areata (pronounced al-oh-PEE-shah
air-ee-AH-tah) is a type of hair loss that's thought to be caused by an autoimmune disease.

If you have an autoimmune disease, the cells in your body that normally fight infection
(white blood cells) attack some of your own cells by mistake.

In alopecia areata, the white cells gather around hair follicles, which are the sacs
from which individual hairs grow. This causes inflammation (swelling) around the follicles.
This stops the hair from growing, makes it fall out, and stops it growing back.

Fortunately, the hair follicles aren't permanently damaged, so your hair still has
the potential to grow back. Most people have one or a few patches of hair loss on
their scalp, but some lose a significant amount of their hair.

But some people lose all the hair on their scalp (called alopecia totalis) or all
the hair on their scalp and body (alopecia universalis).

Alopecia areata is fairly common. It affects about 2 in every 100 people, and it can
happen to people of all backgrounds and ages. And some people with alopecia areata
have more than one episode of hair loss. Many people get it first as a child or young
adult.

Doctors don't know why some people get alopecia areata and others don't. But about
20 in 100 people with alopecia areata have a family member who also has it.

You may also be more likely to get it if you or someone in your family has another
type of autoimmune disease, such as type 1 diabetes, thyroid disease, or vitiligo
(a condition that causes white patches on the skin).

What are the symptoms?
Most people get patches of hair loss over a few weeks. The patches are usually coin-sized
and round or oval. The scalp without hair is smooth and looks normal (it's not red
or inflamed). Some people say they have tingling or very minor pain in the affected
area.

You may have short hairs (around 3 millimetres long) at the edges of these patches.
Doctors call these exclamation mark hairs.

Alopecia areata can also affect any part of your body that has hair, including your
eyebrows, eyelashes, beard area (in men), armpits, and genitals. Some people also
get nail pitting. This is when your nails appear rough or slightly dented.

What treatments work?
There is no cure for alopecia areata, but treatments can help the hair to grow back.
We’ve described the most common treatments below. You can use this information to
talk to your doctor about your treatment options.

However, it's worth noting that many people with alopecia areata have regrowth without
any treatment, especially if their hair loss is mild. As a result, some people choose
not to have any treatment.

Mild to moderate hair loss
If you have mild to moderate hair loss, your doctor may suggest using steroid injections
or medicines you put on your skin.

The steroids used to treat alopecia are similar to chemicals your body makes to reduce
inflammation. Their full name is 'corticosteroids'. They're not the same as the anabolic
steroids used by some bodybuilders and athletes.

Having steroids injected directly into the site of the hair loss is the best treatment for areas of patchy
alopecia, with regrowth usually starting in one to six months. But they don't work
for everyone, and they aren't usually used for children.

Steroids can be injected into any area with hair loss, including your scalp, eyebrows,
and beard area. The doctor may first numb your skin by putting a painkilling cream
on it (called a topical anaesthetic). Depending on the size of the area being treated,
you may need several injections.

You will probably need to have injections more than once. These are spaced four to
six weeks apart.

Injections can sometimes cause thinning of the skin (called mild indentation) but
this is usually temporary. Acne (spots) and redness at the site of the injections
are other possible side effects.

Steroids also come as gels, liquids, creams, and lotions that you put directly on
areas of hair loss. Doctors call these topical steroids. What type you use will depend on where your hair loss is (liquids and gels, for
example, may be easier to apply to your scalp).

Topical steroids are less likely than steroid injections to cause side effects, and
they can be used in children.

Doctors sometimes prescribe steroid tablets if someone is having rapid hair loss. This can help stop or slow their hair loss.
But the improvements may only be temporary, as steroid tablets can only be used for
a short amount of time.

This is because they can cause many side effects, including high blood pressure, increased
appetite, stomach irritation (gastritis), a change in mood and sleep patterns, and
worsening of blood sugar control in people with diabetes.

Minoxidil is a treatment many men use to regrow hair if they are going bald naturally. It is
also sometimes used for alopecia, although it's not yet clear how well it works. It
comes as a liquid and a foam.

You may get some skin irritation when using minoxidil. Sometimes minoxidil treatment
and topical steroids are used together.

If a treatment hasn't worked after six months, your doctor will probably recommend
trying a different one.

Widespread hair loss
If your hair loss is severe, steroid injections and medicines you put on your skin
are less likely to work. But there are other treatments you can try.

Topical immunotherapy (also called contact sensitisation treatment) involves making you allergic to a substance
and then regularly applying a weak version of it to keep your skin mildly irritated
(inflamed). This can stimulate hair regrowth, although researchers don't know exactly
why.

This treatment can have side effects, including blistering, itching, and enlarged
glands in your neck. Your skin colour in the treated area may also become lighter
or darker.

Coping with hair loss
Understandably, many people have a hard time dealing with their hair loss. It can
be especially devastating for children and teenagers, who may already be struggling
with their self-esteem.

Be sure to tell your doctor if you're having difficulty coping or feeling depressed.
Your doctor can provide support, and may recommend talking to a counsellor or attending
a support group. Meeting other people with alopecia areata can be a huge help.

People often wear wigs, hats, scarves, and other coverings to disguise their hair
loss. Coloured scalp powders, sprays, or pastes can also help.

Many men (and some women) opt to shave their head until their hair starts to regrow.
But if your scalp is uncovered, make sure you wear sunscreen to prevent sun damage.


Make-up and temporary tattoos are options for hiding lost eyebrows.
What will happen to me?
If your hair loss is mild, you have a very good chance of full regrowth. Your hair
may be white or fine when it first grows in, but it should return to its normal colour
and texture.

If your hair loss is more widespread, full regrowth is less likely. Most people with
alopecia areata have more than one episode of hair loss in their lifetime.

Up to 10 in 100 people get severe, ongoing alopecia areata. But no matter how severe
your hair loss, you still have the potential to regrow hair, since your hair follicle
is not permanently damaged. Some people even regrow hair after many years.

However, if you have had no regrowth for a long time, or if your hair loss is severe,
it's less likely that your hair will grow back. But remember, alopecia areata is an
unpredictable condition, and no one can say for sure how it will affect you."

If you have alcoholic liver disease, your liver has been damaged from years of heavy
drinking. Treatment can help stop further damage and reduce your chance of serious
problems, such as liver failure. However, for treatment to work, it’s important that
you stop drinking. Your doctor can help.

What is alcoholic liver disease?
Your liver sits just under your ribs, on the right side of your abdomen. It is one
of the biggest organs in your body, and it does hundreds of jobs.

One of the most important is to process everything that you eat and drink, storing
the nutrients that your body needs and getting rid of substances that could be harmful.

Alcohol is one of these harmful substances, and your liver can only handle so much
alcohol at a time. If you drink heavily, this can damage the cells in your liver.

If you continue to drink heavily for many years, this can cause more serious damage,
leading to alcoholic liver disease (ALD).

There is no definite amount of heavy drinking that causes ALD in all people. Some
people get ALD more quickly than others, and at lower drinking levels. This is more
likely if you are very overweight (obese), or have other problems with your liver,
such as an infection called hepatitis C.

Also, women are more likely to develop ALD than men. And the disease often gets worse
more quickly in people who smoke.

There are three stages of ALD.


The first stage is called fatty liver, or steatosis. At this stage, the damage has started to change your liver, leading to a build-up
of fat.



The second stage is called alcoholic hepatitis. This means your liver is injured and inflamed (swollen). This inflammation can lead
to more damage.



The third stage is called alcoholic liver cirrhosis. At this stage, you have scarring in your liver caused by the ongoing damage. As
the scar tissue grows, it replaces healthy liver tissue. This makes it more and more
difficult for your liver to do its jobs.



If ALD is treated early, the damage can be stopped and the liver can often recover.
However, as ALD progresses it becomes more difficult to treat and serious problems
(complications) become more likely. These can include:



liver failure


internal bleeding


problems with brain function


liver cancer, and


kidney damage.


What are the symptoms?
ALD can cause different symptoms in different people. Some people get symptoms early
on, while others have no symptoms until their liver disease is advanced.

Some common symptoms include:


tiredness (fatigue)


loss of appetite


weight loss


a yellow tint to your skin and the whites of your eyes (jaundice)


fever


nausea (feeling sick) and vomiting, and


pain in the upper right side of your abdomen.


When the disease becomes more advanced, it can also cause:


swelling in your abdomen (called ascites). This is caused by a build-up of fluid in
your abdomen



swollen legs. This is also caused by a build-up of fluid


blood in your vomit or stools. This is caused by bleeding in your digestive system.
If you have blood in your stools, they may look black. Blood in vomit often looks
like coffee grounds



problems with confusion, concentration, memory, and sleep. If your liver isn’t working
properly, harmful substances (toxins) can build up in your body, affecting your brain.
This is called hepatic encephalopathy



shaking in your hand when you extend your wrist (called asterixis).


To diagnose ALD, your doctor will ask you questions about your drinking, examine you,
and do tests. Tests can also show how advanced your liver disease is. These may include:




blood tests to check on your liver health and to spot other problems that can accompany
ALD, such as a low amount of red blood cells (a condition called anaemia), low levels
of some important minerals, and liver infection (hepatitis A, B, or C)



an ultrasound or CT scan of your liver


a biopsy of your liver. This involves inserting a needle through your skin to take
a small sample of tissue from your liver. But not everyone needs a biopsy.



What treatments work?
By far the most important part of treatment is stopping drinking. If you don't stop
drinking, your liver won't have a chance to recover and your liver disease is likely
to get worse.

If your liver is very damaged, you may be considered for a liver transplant.
Stopping drinking
Most people with ALD are dependent on alcohol. This means that they find it hard to
control their drinking, and they continue to drink even when it causes problems.

Being dependent on alcohol is an illness (you may hear it called alcohol use disorder
or alcoholism). But with the right support and treatment, you can stop drinking. Treatment
can involve different things. Your doctor can help you explore your options. These
may include:



having counselling or a talking treatment (psychotherapy)


joining a support group, such as Alcoholics Anonymous


entering an alcohol rehabilitation programme.


Sometimes people who drink heavily get withdrawal symptoms when they stop drinking.
These may include:



shaking


anxiety


a fast heart rate, and


nausea and vomiting.


Your doctor can prescribe medicines to help you cope with these symptoms.
Your doctor may also recommend taking medicines that can help reduce your desire for
alcohol.

Vaccinations
Your doctor will probably recommend that you get vaccinations to protect your liver
from two infections: hepatitis A and hepatitis B. These infections can harm your liver,
especially if you have ALD.

Your doctor will also probably recommend getting a pneumonia vaccination (if you haven’t
already had one) as well as a yearly flu vaccination.

Other lifestyle changes
Being very overweight (obese) or smoking can speed up how quickly your liver disease
gets worse. Losing weight and stopping smoking can help slow this damage. Your doctor
can recommend treatments to help.

Many people with liver disease don’t get enough nutrition. This may be in part because
they don’t eat enough, and also because their liver isn’t able to process food as
well as it should.

As a result, your doctor may recommend that you change your diet and eating habits.
This may involve eating several times a day to get enough calories and protein, including
at bedtime and when you first get up in the morning.

You may also need to take vitamin supplements, and cut back on salt.
Treatments for complications
If your liver disease is more advanced, you may need treatment for specific complications,
such as:



fluid build-up


kidney problems


bleeding in your digestive tract, and


problems with brain function.


Your doctor will discuss these with you.
Liver transplant
If your liver has become very damaged, it will no longer be able to do its jobs. The
only treatment option at this stage is a liver transplant.

This involves having surgery to replace your liver with a healthy liver from someone
who has just died. It's a major operation and a liver may take a long time to become
available.

To be considered for a transplant, you need to stop drinking. You may need to stay
away from alcohol for six months or longer before you are added to the list of people
waiting for a liver transplant.

What will happen?
Given the chance, the liver is very good at healing itself. This means that, if your
liver disease is not advanced, your liver might recover if you stop drinking. If you
keep drinking, this will lead to further damage, and possibly life-threatening complications.

Your doctor will probably recommend that you have regular appointments and blood tests
to check on your liver. If you have more advanced liver disease (cirrhosis), your
doctor may also recommend having ultrasound scans every six months to check for liver
cancer.

Because your liver is damaged, it may have difficulty processing certain medicines.
It’s important that you check with your doctor before taking any new medicines, including
herbal remedies and over-the-counter treatments.

Ibuprofen and other pain medicines called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
can harm your liver if you have liver disease. But low doses of paracetamol (up to
2 grams a day) are usually safe, as long as you are eating regularly.

You should keep a written list of all your medicines, and when you need to take them.
It is a good idea to bring this list – or all your medicine bottles – to your doctor
or hospital visits.

You should get medical help right away if you have any of the following symptoms.
They could be a sign of a serious problem, requiring urgent treatment:



Fever


Abdominal pain


Shortness of breath


A fast heart rate


Fast breathing


A dizzy feeling


Blood in your stools or vomit.


After years of heavy drinking, giving up alcohol may seem like an impossible goal.
But with support and treatment, many people succeed. If you have any questions or
concerns, be sure to discuss these with your doctor."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/3000063/Alcohol-use%20disorder,Alcohol-use disorder,"Alcohol-use disorder Last published: Sep 11, 2020
Alcohol-use disorder is a term doctors use for when someone finds their drinking hard
to control, or when their drinking causes difficulties or distress.

If you would like help with stopping or reducing your drinking, or if you are concerned
about someone you know, you can use our information to talk with your doctor about
the options.

What is alcohol-use disorder?
Many people enjoy a drink without any ill effects. And even most people who sometimes
have ‘one too many’ don’t have a problem with alcohol.

But some people struggle to control their drinking and come to rely on alcohol. Their
drinking habits, or their behaviour when drinking, might also cause them problems
at home, work, or school. Or their drinking might be affecting their physical or mental
health.

When someone’s drinking reaches this stage, doctors call it alcohol-use disorder.


The causes of alcohol-use disorder are complex and they vary from person to person.
But they tend to fall into several groups.



Genetic causes. Some people’s genes make them less able to control how they deal with
alcohol and other addictive substances.



Social causes. Some people drink at problem levels because they are regularly exposed
to alcohol. For example, their family or friends might drink at problem levels. Or
they might work for a company with a culture of after-work drinking.



Psychological causes. People with mental-health conditions such as anxiety, post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD), or schizophrenia are more likely to develop alcohol-use disorder
and problems with other addictive substances. Alcohol can give temporary relief from
the symptoms of some mental health problems. But in the longer term alcohol can cause
depression and make these conditions worse.



Environmental causes. Events in your life can lead you to drink more. These events
could be things like struggling to find work, having money worries, coping with the
death of a loved one, or having relationship problems.



Health authorities in many countries recommend certain limits for drinking alcohol.
They advise that drinking above those limits can be bad for your health.

For example, in the UK, the government recommends that you shouldn’t drink more than
14 units of alcohol a week. That’s about six pints of beer or six large (175 ml) glasses
of wine.

But alcohol-use disorder isn’t only about how much you drink; and drinking a little
more than the recommended amount doesn’t mean that you have alcohol-use disorder.
Alcohol-use disorder is an illness that you are not in control of.

What are the symptoms?
Alcohol-use disorder is an illness, but not in the same way as, say, an infection
or asthma. So it might seem strange to talk about it having symptoms. But it does
have them: it’s just that they tend to be certain behaviours rather than physical
things like fever or pain.

People with alcohol-use disorder might have symptoms such as:


drinking more over a longer period than they mean to


making regular attempts to cut down or stop drinking


spending a lot of time or effort trying to get hold of alcohol


needing a lot of time to recover from the effects of drinking


choosing drinking over family, work, or social commitments


regularly missing work, school, or family commitments because of the effects of drinking




continuing to drink regularly despite the problems it causes


continuing to drink regularly despite knowing that it is harming their physical or
mental health



developing a tolerance for alcohol over time. This means that they need to drink more
in order to feel its effects



having withdrawal symptoms when they don’t drink, such as shaking, sweating, and feeling
unwell.



There are no medical tests that can tell if you have alcohol-use disorder. But if
your doctor thinks that your drinking might be causing you harm, he or she might want
to do some blood tests, usually to see if your liver has been damaged.

What treatments work?
Treatments for alcohol-use disorder depend on how severely you are affected. Doctors
broadly classify alcohol-use disorder as mild, moderate, or severe.

These categories are partly about how much you drink, but they also reflect:


how much you depend on alcohol, and


how badly your need for alcohol and your drinking affect your life.


Mild alcohol-use disorder
People with mild alcohol-use disorder might not be heavy drinkers. It may just be
that they struggle to control their drinking once they start, or that their behaviour
when drinking causes problems.

If you have mild alcohol-use disorder, or just occasional problems caused by alcohol,
the first treatment might simply be a talk with a doctor or nurse who is concerned
about the harm that drinking is causing you.

Talks like this might happen during a routine health check. But conversations with
health professionals often happen because people end up in emergency departments because
of the problems caused by their drinking.

After a first discussion, you might have several sessions with a doctor or counsellor.
As part of these talks, he or she will suggest that you develop a plan together, with
the aim of reducing or stopping your drinking.

For some people, these discussions are all they need to start thinking about their
drinking behaviour. They might not have realised that their drinking was a problem.
Or they might have known deep down that they had a problem but had never discussed
it with anyone who could help.

Moderate to severe alcohol-use disorder
People who have moderate to severe alcohol-use disorder usually have obvious health
problems caused by their drinking, such as:



seizures caused by drinking, or


withdrawal symptoms when they don’t drink, such as shaking, confusion, sweating, and
an irregular heartbeat.



Many people will also have problems not related to their health, such as:


relationship problems


problems at work, and


legal problems from drink-driving.


If you have moderate to severe alcohol-use disorder your doctor will want to help
you to stop drinking completely.

As well as medical assessment and advice, treatment for moderate to severe alcohol-use
disorder might include:



detoxification or ‘detox’. This means getting your body alcohol-free and helping you
through any withdrawal symptoms. Some people need to stay in hospital for this stage
of treatment.



rehabilitation (‘rehab’) and aftercare. This involves various measures to help stop
you from taking up drinking again. These can include medical treatments, help with
your mental wellbeing, and help with social issues, such as distancing yourself from
friends who are heavy drinkers.



Rehabilitation might include sessions once or twice a week with a counsellor over
several weeks or months. The counsellor will aim to help you with ways to avoid drinking.
These might include:



coping with stress and with things that make you want to drink


talking about things in your life that make you want to drink


forming positive friendships and relationships that don’t revolve around drinking.




Your counsellor might also suggest that you look into self-help groups, such as Alcoholics
Anonymous (AA). But AA isn’t for everyone. And you should make a plan with your doctor
or counsellor that is best for you.

Medicines
Some medicines can help people to not drink. Your doctor might suggest that one of
these medicines might help as part of your treatment. These drugs work in various
ways, including:



reducing cravings for alcohol


reducing the pleasure that you get from alcohol, and


making you feel unwell if you drink alcohol.


Like all medicines, these drugs can cause side effects in some people. Your doctor
should discuss them with you carefully, especially if there is a chance that you might
take any recreational (‘street’) drugs.

Some street drugs can have a dangerous interaction when taken with these prescription
medicines.

What will happen?
Your doctor will probably want to keep an eye on you for a while after you stop drinking,
to check that you are sticking to your plan, and to ask how you are feeling.

Stopping drinking is hard. Doctors understand this, and they will want to support
and encourage you as much as possible.

Your doctor will also want to check on how you are doing on your medicines, and to
do some tests. Regular alcohol use can cause long-term damage to your liver, heart,
and other organs. So health checks are a good idea.

The treatment for alcohol-use disorder isn’t a cure. Staying away from alcohol is
a lifelong struggle for many people with alcohol problems. And many people need several
attempts, and a lot of help, before they stop drinking for good.

Stopping drinking by yourself is especially hard. So you might find it useful to get
support from AA or one of the other alcohol support groups. Your doctor might be able
to help you find one, or you can find them easily online."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/3000281/Alcohol%20withdrawal,Alcohol withdrawal,"Alcohol withdrawal Last published: Aug 18, 2022
Alcohol withdrawal can happen when a heavy drinker who is dependent on alcohol stops
drinking for a number of hours or a few days.

Withdrawal causes unpleasant symptoms, including nausea (feeling sick) and anxiety,
but it is not always dangerous. But withdrawal can sometimes trigger extreme reactions
in the body’s nervous system, which can cause serious problems and even death.

This leaflet looks at the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal and at what treatments can
help with those symptoms.

What is alcohol withdrawal?
When someone drinks alcohol heavily and regularly over a long period (usually a number
of years), their body can become dependent on it. This means that their body has got used to alcohol and has adapted to it being
there all the time.

If that person suddenly stops drinking, the body can react badly to this change. These
reactions, called withdrawal symptoms, start six to 12 hours after someone stops drinking. They are usually very unpleasant
and can be dangerous.

Emergencies
Severe alcohol withdrawal is a medical emergency. If you or someone you are with has symptoms of severe alcohol withdrawal, get medical help straight away.

The most obvious symptoms of severe, life-threatening alcohol withdrawal are seizures (fits) and delirium tremens.

Delirium tremens (you might have heard it called 'the DTs') is the name given to a
group of symptoms that includes:



Extreme agitation


Confusion


Shaking


Chest pain


Hallucinations


Severe sweating.


Without treatment, between 15 and 20 in 100 people with delirium tremens will die.
But with treatment almost everyone survives.

What are the symptoms?
Mild symptoms
Mild alcohol withdrawal symptoms include:


Anxiety


Insomnia (having trouble sleeping)


Headache


Fatigue (extreme tiredness)


Craving for alcohol


A fast, and possibly irregular heartbeat


Sweating a lot


Nausea or vomiting.


More severe symptoms
Severe alcohol withdrawal needs urgent medical treatment. The symptoms include seizures
and delirium tremens. Delirium tremens involves:



Extreme agitation


Confusion


Shaking


Chest pain


Hallucinations


Skin symptoms, such as itching, pins and needles, and a feeling of 'insects crawling
under the skin'



Severe sweating.


If you have medical treatment for alcohol withdrawal, or if you show signs of withdrawal
while being treated in hospital for another reason, your doctor will ask you about
your symptoms. This helps in finding out what kind of treatment will help you.

A doctor or nurse might also ask you about other things linked to your drinking. For
example, they might ask about:



Any other medical problems you have


Any medicines you take


Whether you use any illegal or recreational ('street') drugs


Your mental health


Your home and work life.


Your doctor might also want to do blood tests to check for problems that can often
affect people who drink heavily, such as liver problems (including hepatitis), and
problems with blood sugar.

What treatments are available?
People with mild alcohol withdrawal symptoms might not need any treatment. But if
you need treatment it might involve being given:



Fluids into a vein if you are dehydrated


Vitamin B and minerals that are low in people who drink heavily


You might also be given medicines to calm your nervous system and stop it reacting badly to the lack of alcohol in
your body. These medicines help to prevent seizures and delirium tremens.

If you have severe symptoms, you might need other treatments, including:


Help to make sure you can breathe properly


Sedation. This is often needed if the medications to calm your nervous system don’t work well
enough. The sedation makes you very sleepy or unconscious, and helps to relax your
nerves and muscles.



Longer-term treatment and help
If you are dependent on alcohol it can be very dangerous if you suddenly stop drinking. Your doctor will still advise you to stop drinking. But they will explain how to
do this safely over a period of time.

For example, your doctor will probably advise you to reduce your drinking gradually over several weeks or months.

This way, your body doesn’t get a sudden shock to the system, like the one that caused
the withdrawal. Instead it gets used to the reduced alcohol over time.

Your doctor might suggest a plan to help you stop drinking. This might involve regular
appointments, and medicines that might help.

Your doctor might also be able to refer you to specialist alcohol services, such as
a community-based alcohol withdrawal programme.

Programmes like this can offer help such as:


regular meetings with programme staff


support with mental-health issues


helping you to find local self-help groups, and


help for your family and for carers, if this is needed.


What to expect in the future
People treated for alcohol withdrawal often have symptoms for a few months afterwards,
such as trouble sleeping, dizziness, and sweating.

But most people don’t have long-term problems, especially if the symptoms are mild.
But some people have serious complications. For example, about 3 in every 100 people
treated for alcohol withdrawal develop epilepsy.

And, even with treatment, about 1 in every 100 people who have delirium tremens will
die.

The ideal long-term goal after treatment is for you to stop drinking. But this can
be really hard to do. People who become dependent on alcohol often have complex reasons
for doing so. And dealing with these issues can take time and be difficult.

There are various ways of starting to get help. For example, in the UK, you can start
with your doctor, who might be able to refer you to specialist services.

Or you could look into organisations like Alcoholics Anonymous (alcoholics-anonymous.org.uk ) and Frank (talktofrank.com ). Different approaches work for different people, and it can take time to find what
works for you."

Caring for a child who has ADHD can put a strain on you and your family. ADHD can
cause problems at home and at school. If your child has ADHD it’s important to get
a proper diagnosis. There are treatments that can help.

You can use our information to talk to your doctor and decide what treatments are
best for your child.

What happens in ADHD?
ADHD stands for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Children with ADHD find
it hard to concentrate, are overactive, and act without thinking.

All children can be difficult at times. But that doesn’t mean that they have ADHD.
Children with ADHD behave in a way that can cause serious difficulties at home and
at school, most of the time. This is not because they’re being naughty - ADHD is a
medical condition.

Doctors think that children with ADHD have brains that work differently from the brains
of other children.

Everyone's brain uses chemicals called neurotransmitters to carry messages between
brain cells. Children with ADHD may have less of two types of neurotransmitters: dopamine
and noradrenaline.

These chemicals affect how we deal with information from the world around us.
A child with ADHD is unable to process information in the same way as other children.
If a child has ADHD:



the outside world rushes in with a flood of noise and images


they cannot decide what's important and get confused


they find it difficult to organise daily tasks and to concentrate on just one activity.


ADHD is nobody's fault. Nothing you or your child has done has caused it. Too much
television, too much sugar, or poor schools do not cause ADHD. Nobody knows exactly
what causes ADHD. It is probably caused by a combination of things.

You might hear ADHD called different names. Doctors used to call it attention deficit
disorder or hyperactivity. Now most doctors use the name ADHD.

But some doctors still use the old names. You may also hear ADHD called hyperkinetic
disorder, or HKD for short.

How can I tell if my child has ADHD?
The main symptoms of ADHD are struggling to pay attention, being overactive, and being
impulsive. Here are some examples of these types of behaviour.

Being inattentive
Inattentive children are easily distracted, drift from one activity to another, and
get bored quickly. They may not seem to listen when you speak to them, and find it
very hard to concentrate.

Homework will probably be a struggle and they might seem messy and forgetful.
Being hyperactive
Hyperactive children find it almost impossible to stay still. They will squirm in
their seat, fidget, and get up all the time. They never seem to run out of energy.
They run about and chatter constantly.

As children get older, they will be less like this. But even adults with ADHD get
restless.

Being impulsive
Impulsive children don’t stop to think before they act. They might seem very impatient
and constantly interrupt when others are speaking.

They often get into trouble at school for talking when it’s not their turn, messing
around, and touching things they are not supposed to. They may be accident prone,
knock things over, or do dangerous things, such as running across roads.

Some children with ADHD have all of these symptoms, while others are either mostly
inattentive or mostly hyperactive and impulsive.

If you are worried that your child acts like this most of the time, talk to your doctor
or your child’s teacher. They can arrange to have your child assessed by a specialist,
usually a child psychiatrist or psychologist.

Unfortunately, there is likely to be a waiting list, so this may take a while. It
may help to keep a diary of your child’s behaviour, to show to the doctor or specialist.


How do doctors diagnose ADHD?
There is no scan or test that can tell if a child has ADHD.
Doctors are very careful about making a diagnosis of ADHD. A wrong diagnosis can be
harmful, because the child might have treatment they don’t need. So diagnosing ADHD
takes some time. The specialist will check to see if your child fits the criteria
of a child with ADHD. This means that:



your child must have six or more symptoms of not paying attention, or six or more
symptoms of being overactive and acting before thinking



these symptoms must have started before your child was 7 years old


your child must have been behaving like this for at least six months


your child's behaviour must be causing problems in at least two places, such as at
home and at school.



The specialist might ask you and your child’s teacher to fill out forms about the
way your child behaves. He or she will also talk to your child.

Your child might need tests to make sure his or her behaviour is not being caused
by anything else, such as hearing problems, epilepsy, or learning difficulties. Only
when the specialist is certain will your child be diagnosed as having ADHD.

What will happen to my child?
Life can be difficult for children with ADHD. They are often in trouble at school
and find it difficult to make friends. But a child's outlook can improve dramatically
with the right treatment and support.

The usual treatment for ADHD is a combination of medicine and therapy. Many children
with ADHD go on to lead normal lives.

Experts used to think that children grew out of ADHD when they were teenagers. And
about one-third of children do. But the other two-thirds still need treatment as teenagers.

And many adults will still have some difficulty with concentrating, controlling their
behaviour, and having relationships. But many adults with ADHD learn to adapt to these
issues.

Working with your child’s school
Children with ADHD often fall behind with their school work, and their behaviour can
cause problems for teachers. It’s important to keep in touch with your child’s school
so that you can work together so that your child gets the most out of school.

Your child's school might decide that your child needs some extra help in the classroom.
For example, it might:



have a Special Education Co-ordinator to give children with ADHD extra help


make special seating areas where your child can work in an area with few distractions
but space to move around



give your child extra breaks, or extra learning equipment, such as computers


break down instructions into manageable steps.


You can ask your child's teacher or head teacher for more information about how to
help your child. Or you could contact your local education authority, the part of
your local council responsible for education.

Ways for children to help themselves
As children with ADHD get older they might be able to learn ways to help themselves.
These are some of the things you may want to suggest.



If they can't remember an instruction at school they should feel able to ask the teacher
to repeat it. They shouldn't guess.



They can break big jobs into smaller stages and reward themselves as they finish each
one.



They can make a list of what they need to do each day. Then they can cross each thing
off the list as they do it.



They should do their homework somewhere quiet.


They ought to do one thing at a time.


They should try to take regular, short breaks.


They can carry a notebook and write down things that they need to remember.


They can use Post-it notes to remind themselves of things they need to do.


Where to get more help
There are various charities and support groups that offer support to parents of children
with ADHD (and often to adults with ADHD). For example, in the UK, The National Attention
Deficit Disorder Information and Support Service (ADDISS; addiss.co.uk) provides advice
and support to families coping with ADHD.

Your doctor might be able to direct you to a similar service in your area. Or you
can search online.

If your child is diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), then
it is likely that their progress at school has been disrupted in some way. For example,
they may fall behind with their school work or have a hard time adjusting to the classroom
routine.

Your child’s school and teachers will probably take steps to help your child adapt
to the classroom and improve their ability to learn. For example, your child's teacher
may be involved in your child's behaviour therapy. Behaviour therapy aims to improve
behaviour through a system of rewards for good behaviour.

Your child's school and teachers may also provide some extra help for your child in
the classroom. Here are some of the things they may do to help.



Involve a special education needs co-ordinator. These co-ordinators work with teachers
to meet the needs of children with ADHD. This means that your child can stay with
classmates but get extra help.



Involve a specialist teaching service to advise the teaching staff.


Make special seating areas. Your child's schoolwork may improve if he or she can sit
in an area that has few distractions but space to move around in and release energy.



Give your child extra breaks or special learning equipment such as computers.


Give your child special instructions so that tasks are broken down into manageable
steps.



Work out a way to communicate with your child in class so that your child doesn't
feel picked on.

Caring for a child who has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) can put
a strain on you and your family. If your child has been diagnosed with ADHD there
are treatments that can help with your child's behaviour so that he or she can learn
and develop positively.

The two main treatments for ADHD are medicines and a talking treatment (psychotherapy) called behaviour therapy. These treatments are often used together.

You can use our information to talk with your doctor and decide which treatments are
right for your child.

Psychoeducation - learning about ADHD
The first thing your doctor or therapist should do is to make sure you have as much
useful information as possible about ADHD. You might hear your doctor refer to this
as psychoeducation.

Your doctor should talk with you about the condition and what treatments are available,
as well as what help might be available in schools.

He or she might be able to put you in touch with other agencies that can offer help,
such as support groups, national associations, and charities.

Medicines
Many children with ADHD, especially those with severe symptoms, take medicines to
help control those symptoms.

Many parents are anxious about long-term medicines being prescribed for their children.
Taking long-term medication is a big step and you need to be as sure as possible that
it’s right for your child.

You can use the information here to talk with your doctor so you can make a decision
together.

Stimulants
The most common drug treatment for ADHD is medicine to stimulate the nerves in the
brain. It may seem strange to treat hyperactivity with stimulants, but stimulants
have been used for many years to treat ADHD.

These medicines should make your child less restless, less impulsive, and more able
to concentrate.

If your child takes a stimulant medicine he or she will begin with a low dose. Your
doctor can then increase the dose little by little if needed. This approach is intended
to control your child's symptoms as well as possible with the least risk of causing
any side effects.

Some stimulants come as long-acting tablets. This means that children don't have to
take as many tablets in one day. So, for example, it might mean that they don't have
to take a tablet while at school.

There are several types or 'classes' of stimulant. So if one type doesn't work for
your child, or if it causes side effects, you might be able to try another.

Stimulants cause side effects in many children who take them. These side effects often
disappear after a couple of weeks. But if they don't disappear, doctors can prescribe
a lower dose.

Common side effects of stimulant drugs are:


reduced appetite and losing weight


tics


finding it harder to fall asleep.


A small number of children get more serious side effects, such as depression, worrying,
and feeling irritable.

Some doctors and parents worry that stimulants might stop children growing properly.
We don't know for sure whether this happens, because the results of research aren't
clear. But your doctor should regularly check your child's height and weight, usually
every six months.

Other issues around stimulants
You might have heard that stimulants could be misused and taken recreationally. But
the stimulants used for ADHD do not provide the 'high' sought by people who abuse
drugs.

Some parents might also worry that taking stimulants will make their child more likely
to become dependent on drugs or alcohol when the child is older. But there's no evidence
that this is likely to happen.

In addition, there have been some concerns that stimulants might increase the risk
of sudden death or strokes in children and adults, especially those with heart defects.
Doctors are therefore advised not to prescribe stimulant drugs to anyone with heart
problems or high blood pressure.

Other medicines for ADHD
There are several other types of medicine used to treat ADHD. Your doctor might recommend
these if stimulants haven't worked well enough, or if stimulants are not suitable
for your child.

Atomoxetine is a type of drug called a noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor. Research suggests that
it probably doesn't work as well as stimulants to reduce ADHD symptoms. But it might
be a useful treatment for some children who can't take stimulants.

Your child can take it as a single daily dose or as two doses.
Atomoxetine can cause side effects in some people. Common ones include having less
appetite and losing weight, feeling sick, feeling tired, and getting indigestion.

Your doctor should monitor your child’s height and weight to make sure that atomoxetine
isn't stopping your child growing properly.

A few people taking it have had serious liver damage, but this is very rare. But if
your child becomes ill while taking atomoxetine you should see your doctor right away.

It's also possible that children taking atomoxetine might be more likely to think
about killing themselves. This is very rare. But you should watch out for signs of
depression or suicidal thoughts if your child takes this medicine.

Like stimulants, atomoxetine is not suitable for people with heart problems.
Alpha-2-adrenergic agonists seem to be more useful for reducing hyperactivity than for reducing inattention.


They are sometimes used alongside stimulants as they can help reduce symptoms such
as sleep problems and tics that can be caused by stimulants.

Like other drugs used to treat ADHD, alpha-2-adrenergic agonists can affect blood
pressure. So if your child takes any of these medicines your doctor will want to check
his or her blood pressure regularly and might adjust the dose if your child's blood
pressure seems a little high.

Other side effects can include tiredness, dizziness, and a dry mouth.
Antidepressant medicines might help reduce ADHD symptoms in some children who don't improve with other drugs.
Antidepressants are not usually prescribed for children as some of these drugs have
been found to cause suicidal thoughts in a small number of children.

If your doctor suggests antidepressants for your child to treat ADHD, he or she should
explain why and should discuss the risks with you.

Behaviour therapy
The main non-drug treatment for ADHD is a talking treatment (psychotherapy) called
behaviour therapy.
Behaviour therapy might help you and your child cope better with ADHD. For example,
some research has found that it can help some school-age children focus better on
homework.

Behaviour therapy can be used as a treatment by itself. But it seems to work best
when used alongside treatment with stimulant medicines.

In behaviour therapy a trained therapist counsels and supports your child and family
and helps you learn to manage behaviour issues linked to ADHD.

The term behaviour therapy covers a wide range of treatments. They are based on the
idea that all behaviour is learned and can be unlearned. Some treatments involve working
with a therapist one to one. Others involve group activities. Your child's teacher
may also be involved in the therapy.

Behaviour therapy usually involves a system of rewards to reinforce and help children
understand positive behaviour. The aim is to help children plan ahead and choose the
right behaviour.

You may feel more supported and better able to cope if your child's treatment includes
therapy as well as medicine. Therapy may also allow your child to manage his or her
behaviour with a lower dose of medicine. This can reduce the chance of side effects.

Diet
There are several theories linking children's diet with ADHD. But these are not supported
by good evidence.

For example, research has not found that changing children's diets reduces ADHD symptoms.
Some parents say that not giving their children sweets or sugary drinks helps, because
they believe their children become hyperactive when they consume sugar. But, while
avoiding too much sugar is a healthy choice for lots of good reasons, there is no
convincing evidence that sugar or artificial sweeteners cause the symptoms of ADHD.

Getting help to cope with your child's behaviour
Many parents of children with ADHD advise other parents not to try to cope with their
child's problems on their own. Getting help and treatment for your child can make
all the difference.

Parent education programmes aim to help parents improve their relationship with their child. The idea is that
this will help the child to be less disruptive.

Parent education programmes are usually done in a group. You learn about how best
to talk to your child and understand your child's feelings. Some people find that
these programmes help improve children’s behaviour and help parents feel less stressed.

Where to get more help
You might want to contact a self-help group for families affected by ADHD. For example,
in the UK the National Attention Deficit Disorder Information and Support Service
(ADDISS) provides advice and support to families coping with ADHD (addiss.co.uk).

Also in the UK, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), which
advises the government on healthcare, has issued advice about how to treat ADHD. NICE
recommends that children under 6 should not be offered drug treatments. Instead, the
focus should be on parent education.

For older children, parent education and talking treatments are usually tried before
medication. However, children with severe ADHD may have drug treatment straight away."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/3000196/Adenoidectomy,Adenoidectomy,"Adenoidectomy Last published: May 01, 2020
Adenoids are part of children’s immune systems. But if they become swollen they can
cause a constant blocked nose and lead to repeated ear infections.

An operation to remove them is usually quick and simple. Here, we look at why a child
might need this operation, how it can help, and what the risks might be. You can use
our information to talk with your doctor about this procedure.

What is an adenoidectomy?
An adenoidectomy is an operation to remove the adenoids. These are soft mounds of
tissue at the back of the nose. They are part of the body’s system for fighting infection
in children.

Adults don’t have adenoids. They start to shrink when children are seven or eight
years old, and they generally disappear completely by the late teens.

Adenoids are useful as one of the ways that the body fights infections. But children
can manage without them if they have to.

In an adenoidectomy, your child’s adenoids are cut away from the back of their nose
to help drain away fluid from inside his or her ears.

The operation is often done at the same time as other procedures. These are:


a procedure to put tiny tubes called grommets into a child’s ears. They help to drain
away fluid from the middle ear, in children who have repeated ear infections or “glue
ear”



a tonsillectomy, which is an operation to remove tonsils in children who have repeated
episodes of tonsillitis.



Why might my child need an adenoidectomy?
Adenoids can become swollen after an infection or an allergic reaction. This doesn’t
usually mean that they need to be removed. But there are several reasons why some
children might benefit from having his or her adenoids removed.



Easier breathing. Repeated problems with adenoids can cause a constant blocked nose so that your child
can only breathe easily through his or her mouth. This can cause discomfort and make
it harder to sleep.



Fewer ear infections and hearing problems. Swollen adenoids can block the openings to the tubes that run from each ear to the
back of their nose (called the eustachian tubes).

These tubes drain away the fluid that’s made in the middle part of the ears. If children’s
eustachian tubes are blocked, this fluid builds up in their ears and stops them hearing
properly.

This fluid can become thick and infected. This is sometimes called glue ear. Not all
children with glue ear or breathing problems have their adenoids removed. Glue ear
can get better by itself and adenoids tend to shrink by the time children reach school
age.

But your doctor might suggest an adenoidectomy if your child has glue ear for several
months, or keeps having ear infections that are affecting his or her hearing. Your
doctor might also suggest that your child has grommets put in his or her ears, to
help the fluid drain away.





Preventing tonsillitis. Doctors try not to take out children’s tonsils unless they’re causing a lot of problems.
Removing the tonsils and adenoids can sometimes help in children who have repeated
bouts of tonsillitis and throat infections.



What happens during the operation?
The operation takes about half an hour. Most children don’t need to stay overnight
in hospital.

Your child will be given a general anaesthetic, so he or she will be asleep during
the operation. Your child will also be given a breathing tube, so that he or she can
breathe normally while asleep.

The mouth is held wide open using a surgical instrument. The surgeon can then reach
in and cut out the adenoids. It only takes a few minutes. Sometimes the surgeon uses
an instrument that uses heat to remove the adenoids.

Your child won’t need stitches after this operation. The bleeding is stopped either
with a gauze pad, or by using the heated instrument to seal (cauterise) the wound.

If your child is also having grommets put in his or her ears, a tiny cut (two or three
millimetres long) is made in their eardrum, fluid is drained away, and the grommet
is put through the opening.

What are the risks?
All operations have risks, and your surgeon should talk these through with you first.
Problems that can happen with adenoidectomy include:


anaesthetic problems. A common side effect of surgery is feeling nauseated (sick)
after having an anaesthetic. Some people are also allergic to general anaesthetics.
But your child will be closely monitored, so it will quickly become clear if this
is the case



bleeding that is heavier than normal. Most children heal quickly after this procedure.
But extra bleeding can happen in the hours or days after the operation. If it happens,
get medical help right away, so that your child doesn’t lose too much blood or breathe
in any blood



infection. This is a risk with any operation and can usually be treated easily with
antibiotics. If your child develops a fever, feels generally unwell, or has a painful
nose, tell your doctor



damaged teeth. The instrument that holds your child’s mouth open during the operation
can sometimes chip a tooth, or knock out any loose “baby” teeth that have started
to come out





nasal speech. Some children can sound a bit nasal when they speak after the operation.
It usually only lasts a few days or weeks while the shape of their mouth settles down.
But if it lasts longer, talk to your doctor. Some children have speech therapy or
surgery to treat this problem





a stiff jaw or neck. This usually clears up after a week or two. Talk to your doctor
if it doesn’t





damage to the eustachian tubes. This usually only happens when a child has his or
her tonsils removed, or grommets inserted, at the same time. Even then, this is rare.



It is very rare to die during a straightforward operation like an adenoidectomy, but
it can happen and your doctor should talk to you about it.

What can I expect afterwards?
It’s not unusual for children to have a sore throat for a while after the operation,
especially when speaking and swallowing.

Your child’s jaw and the corners of his or her mouth might also hurt because of the
way it is held wide open during the operation. A blocked nose for a few days is also
not uncommon.

Paracetamol can help with the pain in the hours after the operation. If it doesn’t
help, it’s important to tell the nurse, as being in pain can slow your child’s recovery.
For example, your child may refuse to eat if eating hurts. So he or she might need
a higher dose or a different type of painkiller.

Your child might also be sleepy after the operation because of the anaesthetic. He
or she will be carefully monitored for a few hours and encouraged to eat and drink.

It can take a week or two to recover fully. In the meantime, your child should take
it easy. It’s best to keep your child off school and away from crowded places for
a week so they don’t pick up infections.

Children should not swim for a few weeks after having this operation, to help prevent
infection. It’s important for your child to drink plenty of fluid and to eat normally.
Don’t worry if your child starts sniffing or sneezing; it won’t cause any damage or
make bleeding start again.

Some children vomit in the first hours after their operation. This is normal if some
blood leaked into their stomach during the surgery. But if there is red, black, or
brown in the vomit more than once, contact a doctor as your child’s throat may be
bleeding.

Some children say it hurts to open their mouth to clean their teeth at first. But
you should encourage your child to brush as usual. This helps to keep the mouth free
of infection and speed up healing."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1501845060426/Acute%20respiratory%20distress%20syndrome,Acute respiratory distress syndrome,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome Last published: Jul 10, 2020
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a serious condition that affects the
lungs. It makes breathing difficult and stops your body from getting enough oxygen.
ARDS usually happens to people who are already severely ill in hospital with another
illness. Treatments can help many people to breathe normally again. But ARDS can be
fatal.

What is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)?
ARDS happens when tissues in the lungs become inflamed (swollen), which makes it hard
to get enough oxygen. The lungs can also partly fill with fluid, making it even harder
to breathe normally.

ARDS usually happens as a complication of another condition, such as a serious infection.
This means that most people who get the condition are already in hospital. But it
can sometimes happen with very little warning: for example, if you get an infection,
such as pneumonia, that comes on very quickly.

Many things can cause ARDS. One of the most common causes is sepsis, which happens
when the immune system’s reaction to an infection harms the body rather than protecting
it.

Other causes of ARDS include:


Breathing in an object that gets stuck in the airway or lungs


An infection of the pancreas (pancreatitis)


Physical damage to the lungs from an injury, such as a traffic accident injury


Burn injuries


Problems related to blood transfusions


Drug overdose


A blood clot in the lungs.


Apart from having a serious illness, things that make ARDS more likely include being
a smoker or a heavy drinker.

What are the symptoms?
The main symptom of ARDS is having difficulty breathing. For example, you might feel
the need to breathe very rapidly to get enough air. You might also cough up frothy
sputum.

ARDS is usually caused by another condition. But if you have breathing difficulties
that come on suddenly before you have been diagnosed with another condition, your
doctor will want to find out what could be wrong with you. So you might need a chest
x-ray, and tests on your blood and sputum to help pinpoint the cause of your illness.


What treatments work?
Medical staff are familiar with ARDS. So if someone being treated in hospital has
any kind of breathing difficulties the doctors and nurses will not be taken by surprise
and will know what treatments to try.

Treating the cause
The best way to treat ARDS and stop it happening again is to treat the condition that
caused it. For example, one of the most common causes of ARDS is a bacterial infection.
These can usually be treated with antibiotics.

Oxygen
Your doctor will want to try to keep your lungs clear of fluid and make sure you get
as much oxygen as possible.

To get enough oxygen you might need what’s called mechanical ventilation. Your doctor
will use a machine to help you breathe through a mask called a respirator. If you
are still not getting enough oxygen your doctor might need to pass a tube down your
throat to get more oxygen directly to your lungs.

Some people need help getting enough oxygen even with the respirator. For example,
they might need a sedative to calm their muscles and nerves, or to be asleep while
the machine helps them breathe.

What will happen?
It’s important to remember that most people with ARDS are already severely ill in
hospital. When people with ARDS die, the cause of death tends to be organ failure
caused by their underlying illness, not their breathing difficulties.

ARDS can be controlled in many people. But between one third and one half of people
who develop ARDS will not recover and will die.

Younger people have a much better chance of surviving ARDS.
People who recover from ARDS usually have weaker lungs than before the ARDS, although
this doesn't always cause symptoms. It is also common to have other problems such
as muscle weakness or long-term pain.

If you have had an episode of ARDS and are worried about long-term effects, talk with
your doctor."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/3000008/Acute%20liver%20failure,Acute liver failure,"Acute liver failure Last published: Jul 19, 2022
When liver function gets worse very quickly in someone who does not already have liver
disease, it’s called acute liver failure (or acute hepatic failure). It is a rare
medical emergency that needs immediate treatment.
What is acute liver failure?
When doctors say that a condition is ‘acute’ it means that it develops quickly. Unlike
chronic liver disease (‘chronic’ means long-term), acute liver failure (ALF for short)
happens quickly.

Depending on the cause, the damage to the liver can sometimes be reversed with treatment.
But ALF is often fatal.

The liver does many jobs in the body, including helping with digestion and removing
harmful toxins. ALF can be caused by several things, including:



deliberate paracetamol overdose, as with a suicide attempt


accidental paracetamol overdose, when someone takes too much paracetamol for pain
or fever over a number of days. This can happen if someone takes multiple cold and
flu remedies without realising that each one contains paracetamol. Paracetamol overdose
is the most common cause of ALF



prescription drugs. Some medicines can cause liver damage as a side effect. These
include: some antibiotics; non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as
ibuprofen, diclofenac, and naproxen; some drugs used to treat epilepsy and other types
of seizure



some herbal supplements


some toxic mushrooms


viral hepatitis and some other infections


autoimmune hepatitis. ‘Autoimmune’ means that the body’s immune system attacks some
of the body’s tissues instead of fighting infections. In this case the immune system
attacks the liver



a condition called shock liver (also called ischaemic hepatitis). This happens when
the liver doesn’t get enough blood supply



Wilson’s disease. This is a rare condition where the liver does not properly filter
out and dispose of excess copper in the blood.



Despite the many things that can cause it, ALF is rare.
What are the symptoms?
The symptoms of ALF come on quickly. The main ones are:


yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes (jaundice)


confusion and sleepiness. These symptoms happen because of swelling in the brain caused
by the reduced liver function



feeling very unwell


pain in the right side of the chest


pain and swelling in the abdomen (tummy)


nausea and vomiting.


If you are with someone and they develop these symptoms suddenly, call an ambulance.
If they have ALF it’s a medical emergency that is life threatening without treatment.


If you are taken to hospital and your doctor suspects that you have ALF he or she
will do some tests. These tests are not just to show whether you have ALF, but to
try to show what has caused it. Knowing the cause helps your doctor decide on the
best treatment.

Blood tests can tell your doctor:


whether you have too much paracetamol or other toxic substances in your system


how well your liver is working, and


whether you have viral or autoimmune hepatitis.


A urine test may also be used to test your levels of paracetamol and other toxins.
Your doctor may also want to do a chest x-ray, and a pregnancy test if you are a woman.

Your doctor will assess how much swelling there may have been in your brain. The less
your brain is affected the more chance you have of making a good recovery.

What treatments are available?
People with ALF will be treated and monitored in an intensive care unit. The best
treatment depends on what has caused the liver failure.

Liver transplant
For people in a very serious condition the only treatment likely to help is a liver
transplant. Everyone with ALF is assessed as to whether they need a liver transplant.
But a suitable liver is not always available. And, even though most people do well
after a liver transplant, there is no guarantee that you will make a good recovery.

Treatment for paracetamol overdose
Paracetamol overdose, whether deliberate or accidental, is the most common cause of
ALF. Most people with this type of liver failure will usually be given a drug called
acetylcysteine, which can often reverse the damage to the liver.

Treatment for acute liver failure from other causes
Acetylcysteine is often also given to people with liver failure from other causes,
as it has been found to improve the chances of recovery.

Treatments for ALF caused by other toxic substances include intravenous (IV) fluids,
charcoal, and antibiotics. Antivirals can also be tried for hepatitis B. Wilson’s
disease can be treated with measures to reduce copper levels. But liver failure caused
by Wilson’s disease is very hard to treat.

What to expect in the future
Survival rates from ALF vary according to the cause.


About 70 in 100 people who have ALF caused by paracetamol overdose will recover without
a transplant.



Between 25 and 40 in 100 people who have ALF caused by drugs other than paracetamol
or by hepatitis B survive.



People with ALF caused by Wilson’s disease are unlikely to survive without a liver
transplant



About 88 in 100 people with ALF who have a liver transplant are still alive a year
later. At three years, the figure is about 82 in 100.



Some people have ongoing liver problems after they recover from ALF and will need
long-term treatment and regular appointments to check their progress.

People who recover from ALF need to make sure they get the right nutrition for the
rest of their lives. You need to eat a healthy diet and take nutrition supplements
prescribed by your doctor.

You will need to avoid certain medicines for a while after your recovery. Your doctor
will advise you which ones, but these will include paracetamol and NSAIDs such as
ibuprofen."
https://bestpractice.bmj.com/patient-leaflets/en-gb/html/1488986354833/Acute%20kidney%20injury,Acute kidney injury,"Acute kidney injury Last published: Jul 06, 2020
Acute kidney injury is sudden damage to the kidneys so that they stop working as well
as they should. It can cause lasting damage and even death. Many people recover much
or all of their kidney function with treatment, but it’s important to get treatment
as quickly as possible.

What is acute kidney injury?
The main job of your kidneys is to filter waste products from your blood. This stops
your blood from becoming toxic and from poisoning you. If your kidneys stop working
properly it can be dangerous and even life threatening.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) used to be known as ‘acute renal failure’. But the name
was changed because, in most people with the condition, the kidneys don’t actually
‘fail’ completely: they just suddenly work less well than they did before. This reduced
kidney function can vary from a small amount to complete failure.

The word ‘injury’ in this case doesn’t mean that your kidneys have been physically
wounded, but rather that something has stopped them from working properly.

AKI is most common in people aged over 65. Other things that can increase your chance
of AKI include:



Having chronic kidney disease


Having sepsis (infection of the blood)


Other health conditions that can affect the kidneys, such as diabetes, severe pancreatitis,
or a urinary infection that spreads to the kidneys



Severe dehydration


Some heart and blood vessel problems, including heart failure


Physical blockages of the kidneys, such as an enlarged prostate, a kidney stone, or
a tumour in your bladder



Long-term use of some medications, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
such as ibuprofen



Use of some recreational drugs.


What are the symptoms?
The main symptoms of AKI are:


Urinating a lot less than usual


Nausea and vomiting


Extreme thirst


Dizziness


Shortness of breath when you lie down


Attacks of shortness of breath and coughing during the night


Increased heart rate.


If you have any of these symptoms, seek medical help. And always get urgent medical
help if you have trouble breathing or your heart beats in a way that is not usual.


Nausea and vomiting can also be symptoms of AKI. On their own they don’t usually suggest
anything serious. But if they happen alongside any of the other symptoms, get medical
help straight away.

Your doctor will need to test your blood and urine to confirm whether you have AKI.
You may also need other tests, such as a scan to show whether your kidneys are swollen
or if there is a physical blockage in one or both of your kidneys.

What treatments work?
Fluids
AKI can be caused by many different things, and the treatment you have will depend
on what your doctor thinks has caused it in your case. But whatever the cause of your
AKI, the first thing that your doctor is likely to look at is whether you are dehydrated,
in which case you will be given intravenous (IV) fluids through a drip.

It’s also possible to be over-hydrated when you have AKI. So you might need to take
medication to make you urinate more (a diuretic).

Or you may need a treatment called renal replacement therapy (also known as dialysis),
which means that your blood is filtered so that it contains the right balance of fluids
and nutrients. Having dialysis at this time doesn’t mean that you’ll need to keep
having dialysis regularly. You might just need it once.

Drug treatments
If you are severely dehydrated because of AKI it can reduce how much blood you have
in your veins and arteries. This can cause your blood pressure to fall too low. You
may need to be given medication to raise your blood pressure until your blood level
is back to normal.

In some people with AKI the body’s immune system can start to attack the kidneys.
If this has happened to you, you will be given drugs that help stop the immune system
from reacting in this way.

You may also need drugs called steroids (the full name is corticosteroids) to help
reduce swelling in your kidneys. (These are not the same as the anabolic steroids
used by some bodybuilders and athletes.) And you may need drugs to treat any infection
that might have caused the AKI.

Stopping or reducing existing medicines
AKI often happens as a complication of another medical condition. If you are taking
medicines to treat another illness your doctor should make sure that you adjust how
much of your medicines that you take while your kidneys are not working properly.


You may need to stop taking some medicines for a time while your kidneys recover.
For example, you will need to stop taking any medicines that contain sodium (salt).


Treatments for a blockage in the kidneys or bladder
AKI can be caused by something blocking the flow of urine from a kidney to the bladder,
or at the bladder outlet, such as a tumour, kidney stone, blood clot, or scar tissue.


If your doctor suspects that you have a blockage in a kidney, you will need to have
a tube called a catheter inserted to help drain the build-up of urine caused by the
blockage.

The catheter is passed through the urethra (the tube that carries urine from your
kidneys out of your body). So you don’t need to have surgery to have it fitted.

This will happen even before the doctor knows for sure that you have a blockage, because
it’s important that a kidney that contains a build-up of urine is drained quickly.
If a blockage is then found you will then need surgery or another procedure to remove
it.

Dialysis
Dialysis is a treatment where a machine takes over the job of cleaning the blood that
the kidneys normally do. You may need this treatment if your kidney function has dropped
to a very low level. You will need to be connected to the machine by a tube in one
of your veins.

What will happen?
Some people recover most or all of their kidney function after treatment. If this
happens you won’t need any more treatment. But you will need to talk to a kidney specialist
(a nephrologist or renal physician) before having any treatment in the future that
might cause another episode of AKI.

Some people do not recover all their kidney function and go on to develop chronic
kidney disease or kidney failure. If this happens to you, your doctor will talk to
you about the treatment you will need in the future, which could include regular dialysis.


Some people die from AKI, although the cause of death is often an underlying condition
that caused the kidney problems, rather than AKI itself. Death is more likely in people
whose AKI is more severe."

Most people get spots as teenagers. Some people also get them as adults. If you don't
like the way your spots look, or if you're worried about scars, there are treatments
that can help.

We’ve looked at the best and most up-to-date research to produce this information.
You can use it to talk to your doctor and decide which treatments are right for you.

What happens?
Acne is just another word for spots. If the pores in your skin get blocked, natural
oil in your skin can build up behind them. This causes spots.

You might hear people say that acne is caused by not washing enough. This isn't true.
And there's no good evidence that eating fatty foods or chocolate causes acne.

What are the symptoms?
Acne usually means you have spots on your face. But you can also get acne on your
neck, back, chest, or arms. You may get blackheads (small black marks) or whiteheads
(white bumps). Spots can also become red and inflamed. Really bad spots can cause
scars when they heal. But getting treatment can help prevent scarring.

What treatments work?
Less severe acne
Research suggests that the treatments most likely to help with mild acne are creams
that contain substances called retinoids. You can buy some of them over the counter
at a pharmacy, but for some stronger versions you will need a prescription from your
doctor. If you're unsure about the ingredients in over-the-counter products you can
ask the pharmacist to explain.

Retinoids work by helping to unblock the skin pores. Like all treatments for acne,
they don't work straight away. It will probably be at least a few weeks before you
see results.

Some people get side effects with retinoid creams that are similar to sunburn, such
as red or peeling skin. But these will probably settle down after a few weeks.

Retinoids can make your skin more sensitive to sunlight, so it's best to take care
in the sun while using them. This means staying out of bright sunlight as much as
possible, and using sunscreen.

Retinoid cream is the only treatment that most people with mild acne need. But for
people who have inflamed skin as well as spots (this is called inflammatory acne),
doctors recommend a combination of at least two treatments, consisting of:



A retinoid cream, plus


An antibiotic (either as a cream or as tablets) or benzoyl peroxide cream, or both
an antibiotic and benzoyl peroxide. Some treatments for inflammatory acne come as
a cream that contains both an antibiotic and benzoyl peroxide.



If you are using both a retinoid cream and benzoyl peroxide, these two treatments
should not be used on the same area of skin at the same time.

Some people get side effects with benzoyl peroxide, such as red or peeling skin or
a tingling feeling. Benzoyl peroxide is a kind of bleach so it’s best to avoid getting
it on your hair, clothes, or sheets. You should also take care in the sun while using
it, by staying out of bright sunlight as much as possible and using sunscreen.

Doctors might recommend that some people with inflammatory acne also use a cream that
contains azelaic acid. Azelaic acid helps reduce swelling and redness in the skin.
You need a prescription from your doctor for this treatment.

Some people get side effects from azelaic acid such as itching, a burning feeling,
and red or scaly skin.

More severe acne
For some people with moderate to severe acne that is only mildly inflammatory, a stronger
prescription retinoid cream is the only treatment they need.

But most people with more severe inflammatory acne will need to take antibiotic tablets
as well, usually for at least six weeks. And some people with severe inflammatory
acne need to take them for much longer.

Your doctor might also recommend that you use azelaic acid cream as well as the other
treatments, to help reduce swelling and redness.

Acne that is very severe or doesn't improve with usual treatments
If you have very severe acne, or if other treatments haven't helped, your doctor might
suggest you take isotretinoin tablets. You need a prescription for this treatment.

Isotretinoin is a type of retinoid. These tablets stop your skin making as much oil
as usual. This can reduce the number of spots you have.

But isotretinoin tablets can have serious side effects in some people.
If you get severe headaches, bad night vision, or mood changes while taking isotretinoin,
you should stop taking them straight away. Like retinoid creams, isotretinoin can
make you more sensitive to sunlight, so you should use sunscreen while you're taking
it.

In some people isotretinoin can also cause dry skin, nosebleeds, aches and pains,
and blood in your urine.

Isotretinoin and birth defects
Isotretinoin causes birth defects if taken during pregnancy. So you can't take it
if you're pregnant or trying to get pregnant. Women need to have a pregnancy test
before starting a course of isotretinoin, and every month while they are taking it.

Acne in women and girls caused by hormonal changes
Some women and girls get flare-ups of acne during their menstrual periods. A condition
called polycystic ovary syndrome (sometimes called PCOS) and some other hormonal conditions
that affect women and girls can also cause acne.

Taking some types of contraceptive pill can help treat this type of acne. If you don't
like the idea of using contraceptive pills to treat your acne, or are worried about
possible side effects from contraceptives, you can talk with your doctor and discuss
what treatments might suit you.

Other medicines called anti-androgenic drugs can also be used to treat hormonal acne.
These drugs help restore the balance of hormones in your body.

Severe acne in pregnant women
Some women find that they get acne while pregnant, and especially early in their pregnancy.
This is caused by hormonal changes that happen during pregnancy. This type of acne
usually clears up later in the pregnancy or after the baby is born.

Many acne treatments, including retinoids, are not safe for women to use during pregnancy.
Some antibiotic creams and azelaic acid are considered safe. But you should talk to
your doctor before using any treatments for acne while pregnant.

What will happen to me?
Acne usually goes away as you get older, although it can last for several years. But
you don't need to wait this long. Treatments can often help you get rid of acne. However,
some people need to keep using their treatments for months or even years before their
acne goes away on its own.

If one treatment doesn't help you, it's worth going back to your doctor. There may
be another treatment that works better for you."

You might be worried if you've been told your child has absence seizures. But there
are treatments that work well. Many children grow out of absence seizures by the time
they're teenagers.

Here, we look at absence seizures caused by childhood absence epilepsy. You can use
our information to talk to your doctor and decide which treatments are best for your
child.

What happens?
During an absence seizure, children ‘shut off’ for a few seconds. They stare blankly
into space and don't know what's going on around them. This usually lasts for 5 to
10 seconds. Although the seizure is brief, children may have several absence seizures
each day. Some children have dozens.

Because a child's brain switches off for a few seconds during an absence seizure,
they might find it hard to learn, or they might have more accidents.

Medications usually work well to control these seizures. But your child may need to
avoid potentially dangerous activities such as climbing, swimming unsupervised, or
riding a bike on busy roads.

There are two types of absence seizures: typical and atypical. This information is
about typical absence seizures caused by a condition called childhood absence epilepsy. These seizures used to be called petit mal seizures.

What are the symptoms?
It can be hard to tell if your child has absence seizures. The symptoms aren't always
clear. Sometimes parents think their child is just being careless or not paying attention
when actually they are having seizures.

Here are some signs you can look for. Your child might:


stare into space and not respond to anything


stop talking in the middle of a sentence


flutter their eyelids, smack their lips, or fidget with their hands.


When an absence seizure ends, the child usually continues doing whatever they were
doing before the seizure. They have no memory of what happened.

If you are concerned your child may have absence seizures, you should see an epilepsy
specialist. This doctor will probably recommend your child has a test called an electroencephalogram (EEG). This measures the electrical activity in your child's brain.

The doctor may also ask your child to breathe very quickly. If your child has childhood
absence epilepsy, this can often trigger a seizure.

Occasionally, a child’s absence seizures are caused by a genetic disorder called glucose transporter type 1 (GLUT1) deficiency syndrome. When someone has this syndrome, their brain doesn’t get enough glucose, which it
needs for energy. This can cause absence seizures, among other problems.

Your child’s doctor may recommend testing for GLUT1 deficiency syndrome if your child
is under 4 years old or if their absence seizures aren’t well controlled by epilepsy
medicines.

What treatments work?
Medicines can't cure childhood absence epilepsy. But they can cut down the number
of absence seizures your child has, or stop them altogether.

But these treatments can cause side effects. You can discuss the benefits and risks
of these treatments with your doctor to decide what’s best for your child.

Doctors usually prescribe one of the following medicines: ethosuximide, valproic acid, or lamotrigine. They all can work well for absence seizures.

However, research suggests that ethosuximide and valproic acid work better than lamotrigine.
Also, ethosuximide is less likely than valproic acid to cause side effects, so it
is often the medicine doctors recommend trying first.

The medicines come as tablets and liquids. Your child will need to take their medicine
every day. Their doctor will start the treatment at a low dose and gradually increase
it. You should not change your child's dose or stop the treatment without speaking
with your doctor.

All the medicines for childhood absence epilepsy can cause side effects. However,
serious problems are rare. Your child’s doctor will carefully monitor their treatment
to reduce their chance of serious problems.



Common side effects from ethosuximide include an upset stomach and weight loss. There's
a chance your child could get problems with their liver, blood, or kidneys. But these
problems are rare.



Valproic acid may make your child feel tired, gain weight, and lose some hair temporarily.
Less commonly, it can cause more serious problems with a child’s blood, pancreas,
or liver.



Common side effects with lamotrigine include difficulty sleeping (insomnia), headaches,
and feeling dizzy. If your child gets a rash or flu-like symptoms while taking lamotrigine,
take them to a doctor straight away. They could have a potentially serious condition
called Stevens-Johnson syndrome.



If one of these medicines doesn’t reduce your child’s seizures, or if it causes worrying
side effects, your doctor will probably recommend switching medicines.

Sometimes other epilepsy medicines are also used. And some children will need to take
more than one medicine.

If your child has been diagnosed with GLUT1 deficiency syndrome, their doctor will
probably recommend trying a ketogenic diet. This diet is designed to provide more energy to the brain.

This diet is high in fat and low in carbohydrates, and includes a moderate amount
of protein. It should only be started under close medical supervision and it may take
a couple of months to have an effect.

Children usually continue taking their epilepsy medicine when starting a ketogenic
diet. Eventually, however, children may be able to gradually decrease, or stop, their
epilepsy medication.

What will happen to my child?
Medicines work well to control absence seizures for most children. Your child’s doctor
will aim to find a treatment that reduces or stops your child’s seizures with few,
if any, side effects.

If the seizures stop, your doctor may eventually reduce your child’s medication, to
see if the seizures start again.

As children get older, they are often able to stop taking their epilepsy medicine
completely. As many as 8 in 10 children with childhood absence epilepsy no longer
have seizures by the time they are teenagers."

This information tells you about an abortion to end a pregnancy.
It explains: the different types of abortion, how they work, what the risks are, and
what to expect afterwards.

This information is about abortions for women who are less than 13 weeks pregnant.
Most women have their abortion in the first 13 weeks of pregnancy. But in many countries
you can have an abortion later than this. Check the rules where you live.

Procedures and practice can vary slightly between hospitals. You can use our information
to discuss what will happen with the doctors and nurses treating you.

What is an abortion?
An abortion is a way of ending your pregnancy. Abortions can be done with drugs or
surgery.

An abortion using drugs makes the muscles of your womb contract. The contents of your womb pass out of your
vagina like a heavy period.

Surgery involves gently stretching the entrance to your womb (called the cervix) until it
is wide enough for the fetus to be removed with a suction tube.

These methods are suitable for early abortions, up to about 13 weeks of pregnancy.
A small number of abortions happen later than this, and with different methods. You
can talk to your doctor about later abortion if you need to.

Your decision
Women have abortions for different reasons. For example, you might not want to be
pregnant because of circumstances at home or problems with your relationship. Or it
could be that your health is at risk, or the baby might have a medical problem.

This information can't help you make the decision to have an abortion. It just tells
you what will happen if you decide to go ahead.

The rules about abortion vary depending on where you live. But in many countries,
including the UK, you are entitled to privacy. This means that no one has to know
about your abortion unless you want them to.

Your partner, parents, or usual doctor don't have to be informed, even if you are
under 16. If you are under 16, most doctors will suggest you talk to your parents.

Can I have an abortion?
You should check the law on abortion where you live, as it varies between countries.
For example, in the UK you can have an abortion if:


you are less than 24 weeks pregnant, and


two doctors agree that it would cause less damage to your physical or mental health
than going on with the pregnancy.

This is a legal requirement, but in many cases it is just a formality. You should
be able to have an abortion if you choose to. If your usual doctor is unwilling to
refer you for an abortion, you are entitled to go to another doctor who will.

Charities that offer abortion advice, such as the British Pregnancy Advisory Service
(www.bpas.org), can help with getting authorisation from two doctors.



In the UK, you can only have an abortion after 24 weeks if there are exceptional circumstances,
such as a risk to your health.

What will happen?
Preparing for an abortion
Before the abortion, your doctors will give you a check-up and ask about your health.
You will also:



have a blood test, if your blood group isn’t recorded already


possibly have an ultrasound scan. This isn't essential, but it can tell you more precisely
how many weeks pregnant you are



be assessed for your chances of having a blood clot in one of your deep veins, usually
in your leg. This is called venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk assessment. Pregnant
women are more likely than non-pregnant women to have VTE.



You should be offered tests to check for common sexually transmitted infections (STIs),
such as chlamydia.

This is important because, if you have chlamydia or another infection, you are more
likely to get a problem called pelvic inflammatory disease after the abortion.

Abortion using drugs
An abortion using drugs is called a medical abortion. You might hear it called the abortion pill, but it doesn't just involve taking a
pill. You need to take two different drugs at a clinic or hospital, usually one or
two days apart.

If you are concerned about the two-day gap, talk to your doctor. There might be some
flexibility about when you can take the second pill. It might also be possible to
take the second pill at home, depending on what services are available in your area.

A medical abortion usually works like this:


On your first visit you take a drug called mifepristone. This blocks the hormone that makes the lining of your womb hold onto the fetus.

You can carry on with your normal life between then and your second visit. But you
might get some bleeding or cramps.



On your second visit, one or two days later, you'll take a drug called misoprostol. It is usually given as a tablet that you put into your vagina (called a vaginal
suppository).

You can also get misoprostol tablets that you swallow, but the drug works better and
has fewer side effects when used in your vagina. The drugs can sometimes make you
feel nauseous, vomit, or have diarrhoea.

After taking the second drug, you might be given a choice between going home and staying
in the clinic or hospital for a while.



The abortion usually happens after the second visit. It will be like a heavy period with clots
of blood. You will probably have painful cramps in your womb. But your nurse can give
you strong painkillers to help with this.

Abortions can take longer to start if you are more than nine weeks pregnant. If your
abortion hasn’t started within four hours of taking the second drug, you might be
given a second dose.

You can be given up to four doses of the second drug, with a three-hour gap between
doses, until the abortion happens.

The abortion should be over within four hours to six hours. You will keep bleeding
after this, but the bleeding will be much lighter.

You'll need to wear sanitary towels rather than tampons to soak up the blood, as tampons
can sometimes cause infections after an abortion.

Surgical abortion
The operation doctors usually use for an abortion is called suction aspiration or vacuum aspiration. This is because the contents of your womb are gently sucked out with a tube and
pump.

The operation takes about 10 minutes. But you should expect to be at the clinic for
a few hours. You can usually go home the same day.

Before the procedure
You don't have to get fully undressed for a surgical abortion. You'll be asked to
take off your pants shortly before the procedure.

You might be given a hormone medication called prostaglandin before the abortion. This will soften the entrance to your womb (the cervix). This
helps your doctor to open your cervix without damaging it.

The prostaglandin might be a tablet that you put into your vagina a few hours before
surgery. Or you might be given tablets to take at home a day or two before your operation.

You can have a general anaesthetic, which makes you sleep, or a local anaesthetic, which numbs the area around the entrance to your womb.

With a local anaesthetic you are awake and aware of what's happening. Your doctor
or nurse will talk to you during surgery to make sure you're OK.

During a surgical abortion, the fetus is gently sucked out of your womb. The suction
can be done with an electric pump or a syringe operated by hand. It doesn't involve
any cutting.

If you have an abortion using an electric pump, you will usually have a general anaesthetic.
Here’s what happens:


First, the doctor inserts a small instrument called a speculum into your vagina so
that he or she can see your cervix. Your cervix is cleaned with a swab.



Your cervix is then gently stretched and opened. This is done with instruments called
dilators. These are inserted into your cervix, starting with one that is 2 millimetres
(1/12 of an inch) wide. Bigger ones are added until your cervix is opened enough.
The farther along your pregnancy is, the wider your cervix needs to be opened.



A thin plastic tube is put into your womb through the cervix. The contents of your
womb are gently sucked into the tube using a pump.



If you're awake during surgery, you'll probably feel strong, period-type pains.


If you're having an abortion with a hand-held syringe, rather than with a pump, the procedure will be a little different. You will probably
have a local anaesthetic, although general anaesthetic is sometimes used. And your
cervix will not need to be opened beforehand, as the tube used is very thin and flexible.

This procedure takes longer than suction using an electric pump.
After a rest and a check-up, most women can leave the clinic within three hours.
How well do abortions work?
Abortions usually work. But there is a small chance that you could still be pregnant
after a medical abortion (an abortion using drugs).

It’s very rare for a woman to be still pregnant after a surgical abortion. But some
women have what’s called an incomplete abortion. This can happen with either type of abortion. It means that some tissue is left
behind after the operation.

If this happens it can cause bleeding or cramps, and you might need surgery to remove
this tissue.

The evidence suggests that medical abortion works better for women who are less than
7 weeks pregnant.

Some women prefer surgery because they don't want the bleeding that happens after
a medical abortion. Surgery is also quicker and happens in one go.

Other women prefer medical abortion because they feel more in control, they see it
as more natural, or because they don't want the risks of surgery or a general anaesthetic.

What are the risks?
All medical procedures have risks. Complications with abortions are rare, but they
do happen. The earlier in pregnancy you have an abortion, the safer it is.

Problems at the time of the procedure
Problems that can happen during a medical abortion include:



pain, from cramps in your womb


side effects of prostaglandin, such as nausea, diarrhoea, and fever and chills. These
side effects don’t usually last very long.



Problems that can happen during a surgical abortion include:



damage to your cervix. This is rare, but it does happen. It is less likely to happen
if you have an abortion early in your pregnancy



damage to your womb. Again, this is rare, and less likely in early abortions.


Problems that can happen soon after the abortion
Most complications of abortion happen in the week or two after the procedure. They
include:



an infection after an abortion. This can lead to a more serious problem called pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). This needs to be treated quickly as it could stop you becoming pregnant in the future



an incomplete abortion. This is when the abortion doesn’t remove all the contents
of your womb. This can cause pain, bleeding, or an infection. If this happens you
might need another operation.



Possible longer-term problems
Having an abortion is unlikely to cause any long-term problems.
Having an abortion is unlikely to harm your health or affect your chances of becoming
pregnant again. You are no more likely than a woman who hasn't had an abortion to
have problems with future pregnancies.

You might have read that having an abortion increases your chance of getting breast
cancer or of having a miscarriage in future. But the evidence suggests that abortion
does not make either of these things more likely.

What can I expect afterwards?
After you leave the hospital or clinic, usually the same day, you will probably want
to go home and rest. You can bath or shower normally.

You can drive after a medical abortion, but you should get someone to drive you home
if you've had an anaesthetic. Driving isn't recommended for 48 hours after a general
anaesthetic.

Most women feel fit enough to return to work within a day or two, but you might prefer
to wait a little longer.

Follow-up appointments
You will not need to go for a routine check-up after a medical or surgical abortion
if your doctor can confirm that the abortion worked at the time of the procedure.

If your doctor is not certain whether the abortion worked, you will need to go for
a follow-up to see if you are still pregnant.

You can also choose to return for a routine follow-up if you wish, just for your peace
of mind, or get a referral if you need emotional support. You can also discuss at
this time any need for further contraception advice.

Rh-negative blood
If your blood type is Rh-negative and you have not already been 'sensitised' (this
means that you already have in your blood antibodies to a substance known as D antigen
that can be detected by a blood test at the beginning of your pregnancy), you will
have an injection of a drug called Rh immune globulin within 72 hours following abortion.

This is done to prevent any chance of you developing antibodies that would attack
a future Rh-positive baby.

Bleeding
You will continue to bleed for a while after the abortion. Bleeding often lasts longer
after a medical abortion than a surgical abortion. You might see clots in the blood.

Bleeding after a medical abortion usually lasts between 14 and 17 days, then trails
off. But it can go on for several weeks. Bleeding is usually lighter after surgery,
but it can still last up to 14 days.

If the bleeding is any worse than a heavy period you should see a doctor. Your usual
painkillers will help with any cramps. You might have spotting right up to your next
period. Your next period should happen in about four to six weeks, although it may
not start for eight weeks.

Infections
You should you see a doctor right away if you have signs of infection, such as:


heavy, continuous bleeding


pain that doesn't go away, or


fever.


An infection is usually easy to treat with antibiotics. But it could affect your ability
to become pregnant again if it's not treated.

Using sanitary towels instead of tampons until you stop bleeding can help prevent
an infection. If you can, wait until your check-up after the abortion before you have
sex again. If you have sex before this time, it's best to use condoms.

Signs of pregnancy
If you have signs of pregnancy, such as morning sickness, these will gradually go
away as your hormone levels return to normal. Breast tenderness is often the last
sign of pregnancy to disappear.

But if you still have signs of pregnancy two weeks or three weeks after the abortion,
you need to see your doctor.

A pregnancy test can't tell you if you are still pregnant, because the hormone it
measures can take up to a month to return to normal levels after an abortion.

Contraception
You need to use contraception immediately after your abortion if you want to avoid
becoming pregnant. This is because you are likely to produce another egg (ovulate)
before your next period. So, you could become pregnant again before your next period
is due.

It's safe to have a coil (also called an intrauterine device or IUD) fitted straight
away.

How will I feel afterwards?
Your feelings afterwards might depend on your reasons for having an abortion and how
comfortable you are with your decision.

For example, some women feel sad and tearful after an abortion, while others say they
feel relieved that it's over. Other women feel guilty or have a sense of loss. Some
women still have emotional problems several weeks later.

There’s no evidence that psychological problems are common after having an abortion.
But if you have feelings of depression or anxiety that don’t go away within a few
weeks, talk to your doctor.

You might not feel like having sex for a while. This is normal. Many women feel this
way. And some women say that they have problems in their relationships after an abortion.

Having someone to talk to can help. If you have problems coping, ask your nurse or
doctor about counselling."

If you have an abdominal aortic aneurysm, the wall of your aorta (a major blood vessel)
has weakened and is ballooning outwards. If the wall of the aorta gets very weak it
can burst. This is very dangerous, but it usually happens only after an aneurysm has
reached a certain size.

Here, we look at how aneurysms are found and monitored, and what treatments can help
if there is a risk that an aneurysm will burst.

What is an abdominal aortic aneurysm?
Your aorta is the main artery that supplies blood to your body. It is about the width
of a garden hose and runs from your heart down through your chest and abdomen before
branching off into smaller blood vessels.

As you get older, the wall of your aorta can weaken, causing a section in your abdomen
to balloon outwards and form a bulge.

The bulge is called an abdominal aortic aneurysm. You might also hear it called AAA or triple A.

AAAs tend to get larger over time. Most grow slowly but some get bigger quite suddenly.
If an aneurysm is small when it is detected, it may never grow big enough to cause
problems. But large aneurysms can be dangerous.

If the wall of the aorta gets very weak it might burst (rupture), causing massive
internal bleeding. This is fatal for about 90 in every 100 people.

We don’t know exactly what causes the wall of the aorta to weaken, leading to an AAA.
But certain things can make it more likely. Here are some of the most important.



Being a man. Men are four to six times more likely than women to get an AAA.


Getting older. These aneurysms are not common in people under age 55. But your chance
of having one increases as you age. Up to 10 in every 100 men age 65 to 79 have an
AAA.



Smoking. The chance of having an AAA increases the longer you have smoked.


Having one or more close family members (such as parents or siblings) with an AAA.




What are the symptoms?
You will probably not notice any symptoms if you have an AAA. Most people don’t feel
any pain or notice anything different.

But some people get pain in their abdomen, groin, or back, which can be a sign that
an aneurysm may soon rupture.

Since AAAs usually don’t cause symptoms, most people find out they have an aneurysm
in one of two ways.



As an accidental finding. AAAs are sometimes found through tests done for other reasons, such as an X-ray
for another problem. They are also sometimes spotted during a routine physical examination
when a doctor feels a bulge in the abdomen.

But this usually happens only if a patient is thin and the aneurysm is large. If your
doctor thinks you have an aneurysm, you will have an ultrasound scan to find out for
sure.



Through screening. Since older men are particularly likely to get an AAA, doctors often recommend that
men aged 65 and older have an ultrasound scan to check their aorta. This is called
screening.

Women and younger men are also sometimes offered screening if doctors think they have
an increased chance of having an aneurysm (for example, if they have close family
members with an aneurysm).



If you are diagnosed with an AAA, your doctor will measure how large it is during
your ultrasound scan. Doctors in different countries sometimes define large aneurysms
in different ways. But aneurysms are often considered large if they are:



at least 5.5 centimetres wide for men, or


at least 5 centimetres wide for women.


What treatments work?
The main treatment for an AAA is surgery to repair it. But not everyone with an aneurysm
will need surgery. This is because the benefits of having an aneurysm repaired don’t
always outweigh the risks of surgery.



If your aneurysm is small and not causing any symptoms, it is not likely to rupture.
So your doctor will probably recommend that you have surveillance instead of surgery, at least for now.

Surveillance means having regular ultrasound scans to check on your aneurysm. Your
doctor may also recommend surveillance if you have a large aneurysm but you have other
health problems that would make fixing it more risky.



If your aneurysm is large or is causing symptoms, your doctor will probably recommend
having surgery. Your doctor will also probably recommend surgery if surveillance shows that your
aneurysm is growing quickly.



Surveillance
If you have surveillance, you have regular ultrasound scans to check on the size of
your aneurysm and how quickly it is growing.

How often you have a scan will probably be based on the size of your aneurysm. For
example, if your aneurysm is very small, you may need an ultrasound only every two
to three years. But if it is larger, your doctor may recommend having an ultrasound
every six to 12 months.

During surveillance, your doctor may also recommend doing other things to help slow
the growth of your aneurysm.



Stopping smoking: Smoking is linked to faster aneurysm growth. Giving up smoking may
help slow this growth. Your doctor can recommend treatments to help.



Taking medicines. These may include medicines called beta-blockers to lower your blood
pressure, and medicines called statins to lower the cholesterol in your blood.



Aneurysm repair
Repairs for AAAs aim to strengthen the section of your aorta that is bulging, to help
prevent it from rupturing. There are two types of repairs and both can work well.




Endovascular repair: This operation places an artificial piece of artery, called a graft, inside your
aneurysm.

‘Endovascular’ means the surgery is done through your blood vessels, with the help
of tiny tools and cameras. A surgeon makes small cuts in your groin at the top of
your legs to reach large blood vessels.

The surgeon then attaches the graft to a thin tube. He or she uses X-rays to guide
the graft through the blood vessels and into the aneurysm. When the graft is in the
right place, your surgeon fastens it with small hooks or pins.



Open repair: In an open aneurysm repair, a surgeon makes a large cut into your abdomen to reach
your aorta directly. The surgeon then cuts open the aneurysm and stitches a graft
inside. The aneurysm is then closed with the graft inside.



Endovascular repair is a newer type of surgery. But it is becoming more common, as
it is a smaller operation, with a faster recovery.

Sometimes, though, the graft moves or leaks after an endovascular repair, which means
you will need more surgery. So doctors recommend having regular scans – such as ultrasound
or CT scans – to check on these repairs.

This usually means having a scan one month and 12 months after the repair, and then
every five years. Regular scans aren’t usually needed after an open repair.

Both endovascular and open repairs can sometimes cause serious problems (called complications),
such as heart and blood flow problems, bleeding, and infection.

To help prevent heart and blood flow problems, your doctor may recommend taking a
beta-blocker in the days leading up to your surgery. You will also probably be given
antibiotics during and after your surgery to prevent infection.

What will happen?
Many people never have problems from their AAA.
But if an aneurysm does rupture, the chances of survival are small. That’s why it
is so important to detect these aneurysms early, and to monitor them if they are small
and not causing symptoms, or to have them repaired if a rupture seems more likely.

Your doctor will help you decide on the right approach for you."

The 6-in-1 vaccine is a single injection designed to protect against six diseases.
It is given to babies in several doses in the first few months of life.

What is the 6-in-1 vaccine?
The 6-in-1 vaccine is a single injection that protects against six different infections.

But vaccination schedules can vary between countries. So children in some countries
might be vaccinated against these six infections in different ways (for example, with
several different vaccines) and at different ages.

But in countries with established vaccination programmes, it is common to vaccinate
against all of these infections in some way.

In the UK, the 6-in-1 vaccine is one of the first vaccinations given to babies when
they are very young. It is designed to protect against six diseases that can cause
serious illness or death. These are:



diphtheria


hepatitis B


Hib (Haemophilus influenzae type B)


polio


tetanus, and


pertussis (whooping cough).


What is diphtheria?
Diphtheria is a bacterial infection that can cause breathing problems, heart failure, paralysis,
and death.

Because of vaccination programmes it has almost disappeared from developed countries
including the UK, the US, and Western Europe. But it is still common in developing
countries where vaccination rates are low.

What is hepatitis B?
Hepatitis B is a virus that affects the liver. In adults it can often be fairly harmless (although
some people develop long-term problems). In children it can cause serious liver damage
and even liver failure.

In developed countries with successful vaccination programmes, hepatitis B is much
less common than it used to be. But it is still widespread in parts of Asia, South
America, and Africa.

What is Hib (Haemophilus influenzae type B)?
Hib is a bacterial infection that can cause various life-threatening conditions, including
meningitis, sepsis, and pneumonia.

Vaccination programmes have made Hib extremely rare in developed countries. But it
is more common where vaccination rates are lower.

What is polio?
Polio is a viral infection that can cause muscle weakness and paralysis. It used to be
common all over the world.

Because of successful vaccination programmes, polio is now only found in a few countries
in Asia.

What is tetanus?
Infection with tetanus causes symptoms including muscle pain and breathing problems. You might sometimes
hear it called lockjaw, because it can make it hard to open your mouth.

You can become infected with tetanus if bacteria get into a wound. Vaccination programmes
have made tetanus very rare in developed countries.

What is pertussis?
Pertussis is more commonly known as whooping cough. It is an infection that causes symptoms like those of a cold, as well as coughing
that’s followed by a gasping sound.

Pertussis can lead to serious problems, such as dehydration, pneumonia, and seizures
(fits).

While vaccination programmes have made whooping cough much less common, it is still
sometimes found in developed countries.



If your child has symptoms of whooping cough seek medical advice immediately.



If your child seems to be having trouble breathing, or if your child’s lips turn blue,
call an ambulance or go to the nearest emergency department.



Who needs the 6-in-1 vaccination?
Vaccination schedules can vary between countries.
For example, in the UK, babies have three doses of the 6-in-1 vaccine. These doses
are when babies are:



8 weeks old


12 weeks old, and


16 weeks old.


This schedule of three doses is the best way to build up strong immunity in babies.
With each dose, your baby is better protected.

Older children should also receive booster injections against some of the diseases covered by the 6-in-1 vaccine. For example, in the UK,
children receive boosters at age 3 years, and at age 14 years.

You can read more about these boosters in our leaflets: DTP vaccination (diphtheria, tetanus, polio) and DTaP vaccination (diphtheria, tetanus, polio, and pertussis).
Is there anyone who shouldn’t have the vaccine?
Your baby should not have the vaccine if he or she:


has a fever. You should wait until your baby has recovered and make another appointment



is allergic to the vaccine or any of its ingredients. You should tell the medical
staff giving the vaccine about any allergies your baby has



has a neurological (nervous system) problem that is getting worse, including poorly
controlled epilepsy. Your baby should see a specialist before having the vaccine.



Is it safe?
The 6-in-1 vaccine has been in use for a long time and is very safe. It’s also safe
for your baby to have this vaccine at the same time as other vaccinations.

But, like all vaccines, it can cause side effects in some babies. Common side effects
include:



pain, redness, and swelling where the injection was given (called the injection site)


a high temperature (fever). This is more common after the second and third doses


vomiting


irritability. This is because your baby might feel a bit unwell just after having
the vaccine



loss of appetite.


Less-common side effects are:


high-pitched crying, and


seizures (fits).


Very rarely, a baby has a severe allergic reaction to the vaccine. But the medical
staff giving the vaccination will be trained how to deal with this.

How is the vaccination given?
This vaccine is given as an injection into your baby’s thigh.
How well does the vaccine work?
The vaccine works very well.
The diseases that this vaccine protects against used to be common all over the world.
But successful vaccination programmes have made most of them extremely rare, especially
in developed countries.

For example, diphtheria and tetanus are now almost unheard of in developed countries,
and polio has disappeared from all but a few countries."
